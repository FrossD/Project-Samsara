All who made Project Samsara possible.

## Finance
Samsara doesn't cost anything to build or maintain. It is hosted exclusively on free services. That being said, I myself have my own needs, and the many Samsara Supporters have taken it upon themselves to ensure that those needs are met, and that the project can go on. To all members of the merchant's guild, past and present, you have my utmost gratitude.

## Contributions
Various parties have contributed content to Project Samsara, be it in the form of small ideas that took bloom into much larger, verse-spanning concepts, or by writing and submitting entire proposals themselves. Every single of these contributions and those that gave them have been pivotal to the realization of Project Samsara, and for that I am immensely grateful.

### Co-Writer B
Being my own skin and blood, they've earned a unique flavor of gratitude from me.

- They contributed extensively towards seeding the baseline ideas that would later become the Dendro-Vitric Root Network (DevitNet) and come to be fully realized in [[Communications and Compute]]. They additionally named the Anarhiza, the integral part of Switchboard communications, the DevitNet, as well as the Vitric Shelf itself.

- They used their own knowledge of science and engineering to revise and contribute feedback that would be used to rebuild [[SB_Technology]] in its second iteration.

- Also created art for the Samsara canon, picturing a chalkstrider in all their calcified, nomadic, god-child glory. 

- Provided a bank of names that came to be used for characters, planets, and more both as placeholders and final choices.

### Co-Writer F
Asides from unfailing financial support, Writer F has contributed;

- The seed-ideas that would later become the entirety of [[Martial Disciplines]], detailing the various combative styles used by actors and factions in the Switchboard.

### Writer H
Writer H has distinguished themselves with extensive contributions in nearly all spheres of Samsara. Willingly and effortlessly dispensing from their vast reserves of knowledge, the foundations of the canon were shaken time and time again to their core, in a bid to establish a robust airtightness of mechanics that would ensure all that would come to be built upon it would stand the test of time. They are unparalleled in deed, and stand tallest even among the tall.

- Every single iteration and expansion upon the Void from the original draft of it, all the way up to the upcoming fifth iteration, is entirely the product of their extensive command over physics. Going into detail would triple the length of this document, but in sticking to highlights, 
	- They established the Void as being a result of information curvature, which is in turn a result of information mass. 
	- Established mechanics surrounding the depth of the Void and ramifications of travelling through it, just about fully realized the concepts of negative information and the applied form of it as the depthstride.
	- Seeded the ideas that would form the basis of Depthstrider powers in the forms of Giving, Taking, and Shaping, as well as Curvature Manipulation.
	- Revised the concept of the 'Void as a Being', in that they said "Mathematics doesn't work like that," and as such I decided "Okay, its actually not mathematics anymore," which birthed the writ of *Proposal: Blackjack* which would later go on to form the basis of the entirety of Vahnkin canon.
	- Saved me from almost putting time travel in the universe. That one gets a special 'thank you'.
	- Provided the material that led to solving the negative information problem, which lies at the bedrock of all depthstrider powers.

- Just about the entirety of the Switchboard's cosmology and astronomy - as outlined in [[SB_Astromechanics]] - are the resultant of lengthy discussions had on the workings of these things, these discussions being especially enlightening as this is very much their field of study.
	- This includes their devising of the 432-day **Astrolabic Calendar**, as a replacement for the 365-day totally-not-our-calendar... calendar. 

- Provided very valuable insight and feedback on the many subject matters outlined in [[Birthing and Being]], this being very much *not* my wheelhouse.

- Did *extensive* work in the final realization of chalk as the building-blocks of the canon, the universe and as a power system. So extensive is their contribution that much of it simply wouldn't exist in the shape that it does without them. [[The Hands as Chalk]] is almost entirely their fabrication, an inevitability after many, many revisions. This included just about everything to do with the Five Straits, chalk folding and equations, ribbons, pattern and weave, information tangibility and mass, spontaneous equations and teks.

- Wholly perfected the idea of hyperweave and by extension, hyperweave cooling, which would be an integral mechanical explanation for the very existence of *complexity itself* in the Samsara universe.

- Worked through *four* iterations of [[Glass]], giving fruition to the idea of a chalk-caustic negentropic force in the Switchboard canon, that would go on to facilitate the fearsome Shattered explained in [[SB_Biota#Fauna|Switchboard Fauna]], as well as explain how toaster ovens work in [[SB_Technology]].

- In turn made valuable contributions in realizing [[SB_Technology]] despite having killed the atom and thus electricity. 

- Devised, basically singlehandedly, the entire concept of praximechanics. This concept spanning [[The Blank-Slate Mind]], [[The Doctrine of Passing]], [[Praxis Impositions]], and further on is perhaps one of the most integral pieces of the entirety of the verse's canon, and was built solely via their integration of the concept of Bayesianity. This would later go on to create the entire concept of praximechanics, a power-system-above-power-systems that justifies the litany of more esoteric things that exist in the canon.

- Elaborated upon the workings of various mechanics after it was realized that Samsara's worldbuilding was fundamentally incompatible with the existence of the atom, as well as all other things dependent upon it. This manifested as a litany of problematic holes in the world's mechanics - such as a lack of an explanation for how light worked - all of which they resolved. These included revisions to [[The Strider Protocol]], the creation of [[Calcodynamics]], solving the light problem, the realization of hyperweave, giving new purpose to the Switchboard's stars, explaining the relationship between heat and motion, spawning the idea of inductive weave, and far more.

- Brought the concept of Clocking - a holdover from an older project - into much more workable state. 

- Asked me if denizens of the Switchboard eat... which prompted me to build all of [[SB_Physiology]].

- Took pictures of dozens of flowers at a botanical exhibit for the purpose of building out [[SB_Biota#Flora|Switchboard Flora]].

- Wrote extensive documents and proposals for all of the above, engaging me in spirited back and forth discussions - and above all, put up with me for the longest time - all without complaint.

### Co-Writer M
They've shown bottomless enthusiasm in both Project Samsara and a litany of projects preceding it, generously entertaining me in the more outlandish - bordering on outright silly - aspects of building Samsara. Delving into specifics they've;

- Contributed a feedback on the [[The Fel-Arcad]] document, having taken an instant, infectious liking to their characterization in the Samsara canon.

- In turn, they've contributed a written entry that would later become a proposal in its own right under the Fel-Arcad, detailing a differentiation of arcologies to better contribute to a more realistic portrayal of an interstellar civilization.

- Additionally, they've devised an original character alongside the design principles of the Samsara canon.

- They've also generously used their own resources to have art commissioned for the project, depicting the character of Operator Adven Ventura.

- Perhaps above all, they've been a greatly appreciated, light-hearted conversation partner for nearly all aspects of Samsara that I found too unserious, ridiculous, telling of me, personal or just probably wouldn't be grasped in the way I'd like by others. Despite their own admitted weaker grasp on the entirety of the canon, and how it ails them to read through the endless piles of writ I push out every day, they've never relented in their zeal. There is little else a creative can ask for than a receptive, engaging audience. For that I am very, very grateful.
