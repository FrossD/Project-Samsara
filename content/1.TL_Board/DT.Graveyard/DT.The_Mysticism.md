# The Mysticism
Perhaps the highest doctrine in the Switchboard; the doctrine that creates doctrines by usage of the interpretative powers. The Mysticism is the power to reconcile beginnings and ends.

## A Foreword
It is not often I begin transcribing a document after it has already become outdated, or rather, redefined by the introduction of new canon and reassessment of old. As such, this document simply *has* to be rewritten, in alignment with the 'Axle of Axles' doc that is under development. That said, we may proceed.

## Thinking 2.0
The core of the Mysticism is a new manner of thinking. 'Thinking' as performed in the Switchboard and under chalk mechanics is a product of the computational line of the Five Straits under the Weave Protocol. This computational line, being chalk itself, is subject to many of the same principles that chalk usually is, particularly that of **spontaneous equations**. Equations are chalk that fold chalk. and the computational line is what directs equations to act on the chalk it interacts with. That said, the computational line itself can be 'refolded', according to the principles outlined under [[The Blank-Slate Mind#Strider Evolution |Strider Evolution]], as detailed in [[The Blank-Slate Mind]].

By compelling oneself to attempt new manners of 'thinking', the computational line can be tuned - folded - to realize the the outcomes of that 'thinking'. Usually though, simple self-reflection, or copying methodologies employed by someone else isn't enough to prompt the fundamental changes in the computational line necessary to begin 'mystic thinking'. Massive evolutionary jumps such as the one from a standard computational line to one capable of realizing the ends of the Mysticism takes equally monumentous changes - epiphanies, almost.

	What these are carry considerable narrative significance, and so can be speculated but for now will be left for later.

## The Interpretative
The interpretative is a means of seeing something in a different yet tangentially similar manner, and this process of 'seeing' resulting in the spontaneous creation of an equation - from an evolved computational line - that is capable of folding the chalk of what is actually present and initially perceived into what the interpreter/mystic wants or chooses to see in it.

In a sense, it is alchemy. It converts the physical and the tangible into the abstract and immaterial. For example;

- Food -> Sustenance
- Sword -> Violence
- Gate -> Control
- Brick -> Solidity
- Glass -> Transparency

### What does this mean?
The Mysticism is very much a practical power that requires a person aiming to understand it to be open and willing to entertain some absurdities. 

An example. A Mystic can interpret 'food' as 'sustenance'. A food item such as a pie is then deconstructed by their computational line and refolded by it into a chalk ribbon of 'sustenance'. This ribbon of 'sustenance' can then be used by the Mystic wherever 'sustaining' is needed, such as fuel for a vehicle, or buying time for someone injured. A vehicle can't take food, but a Mystic can 'bridge that gap' between the kind of sustenance that is food, and the kind of sustenance that is fuel, and *substitute one for the other*.

	This paragraph is indented as I honestly don't even know what I meant here;
	
	The Mysticism is the perfection of information tangibility, working to allow interaction with what only exists as information. The Mysticism allows working with abstract concepts on a physical plane, and this is what grants their power.

The main use of the Mystics' abstract chalk ribbons are in the casting of rituals. In the collation of ritual components, flowers and marks can be replaced by the abstract chalk ribbon of what they are meant to represent. A ritual that requires a flower that represents 'deception', for example, could instead have the flower replaced by the 'purified' interpretation of it - a chalk ribbon of pure deception. The usage of these pure concepts serves to 'supercharge' rituals.

### The Doctrine of Everything
A Mystic can interpret a weapon into the abstract concept of 'violence'. From there, they may form a 'doctrine of violence' that allows them to empower their weapons - anything, basically, that allows them to exert violence - to allow them to function as doctrinal or philosophical weapons. Understanding the true nature of a concept, or understanding it in totality allows for usage as they see fit.

For example, a Mystic may interpret a collection of tessellating shapes into pattern, granting the Mystic a 'doctrine of patterns'. The power granted by this doctrine may then be to compel an ensemble of disjointed objects or entities to arrange themselves into patterns, or the ability to perceive patterns in any 'thing'.

A doctrine of sustenance derived from the interpretation of food or fuel grants the power to sustain anything that needs sustaining. While most simply this could be refilling stomachs and engines, it could also be a means to 'refuel' resolve or morale.

	The interpretative powers are very hard to pin down at one spot and fully define te extent to which they can be taken. It could very well be said that the bounds of the interpretative powers are an individual Mystic's ability to think as vastly and deeply about the subject as possible, into what the doctrine formed from that interpretation grants the ability to do.

## Mystic Ritualism
The interpretative powers present a new dimension to the rituals used by Striders. Ribbons of abstract concepts can serve as the 'distilled' counterparts to the components required by a ritual.

As an example, a ritual may require a mark that represents deceit or deception. A regular Strider may place a falsified document, or fake currency, or something disseminating false information. A Mystic can interpret any of those things and obtain the pure, distilled, concept of deception in ribbon chalk form. In a ritual requiring violence, a Strider may place knives or ammunition; a Mystic places pure violence. In a ritual requiring order, a Strider places a well-designed index of books. A Mystic - as you might have figured out already - places pure order.

As such, rituals cast by Mystics - put as simply as possible - have higher multipliers. They are stronger because what is used in the preparation of the cast is purer - truer to what is desired by the ritual schema. 

## 'Stretching' Interpretations
A concept known as 'multi-interpretations' means that multiple interpretations can be derived from a singular subject. However the subjective 'further' the subject is from the interpretation desired from it, the weaker the final interpretation that's obtained. This is the problem of 'stretching the interpretation'. 

For example, it is fairly easy to interpret a brick as 'order' due to its nature, but not so much as 'violence' due to the fact it can be thrown to cause harm. Similarly, it is easy to interpret food as 'sustenance', but not so much as 'poisonous' just because some food as poisonous - and even less so as 'wealth' because the wealthy can indeed have large amounts of food.

## The Doctrine of Motion
What can be obtained from interpreting the Strider Protocol?

Most prominently, motion. The Strider Protocol is nigh motion incarnate, and the Mystic interpretation of that allows for creating a doctrine of motion, which evolves the Strider Protocol into a final, perfect form; the **Skydance**.

The Skydancer's Stride exists without limitation. The Mystic Skydancer can go anywhere, traverse any distance, cross any Veil, plunge into any depth and emerge without issue - and do it all at speeds vastly exceeding the Strider Protocol. The Skydancer, by virtue of understanding what it truly means to move, is able to do so without limits.

	As a narrative point, it is the Stride used by the King of Roads, Shalkarah, the power often appended to his name, extending it to 'Shalkarah, the Skydance' or just 'Shalkarah Skydance'. The limitless nature of the Skydance is what contributes to his myth-inspiring elsuivity as a character.

## The Witch of Gates
This section discusses narrative; it is not final and subject to change.

	One of the five Strider Starsailors was an immensely powerful Mystic, bearing the title of the 'Witch of Gates'. Her interpretation of 'gates' to 'authority' and the doctrine of it granted her the power to compel man and law alike to submit to her will.
	
	The power she wielded drew Striders to her, becoming the first truly organized faction of Mystics, which drew the concern of other Striders and the Grounded. The Witch's aims led to conflict, and en event simply known as the Mysticism, leading to a collapse of Strider society and the narrative backdrop to which the Post-Mysticism takes place.

## Ripped From SlateMind 2.0: Strider Evolution
	I will need the good doctor to comment further on this.

At first glance, I feel Strider Evolution is already all that it needs to be. Initially it exists a means to justify the existence of the Mysticism, and outside of it, it doesn't have any real defined use other than as an axle for something in the future to hinge upon. 

It can however be restated with new language, as done in [[DT.The_Mysticism]] under [[DT.The_Mysticism#Thinking 2.0|Thinking 2.0]]; 'thinking' in Striders is a product of the computational line, and the computational line itself is made of chalk, and is hence subject to the same principles chalk is. And so while the computational line is what directs equations to fold chalk, the computational line itself can be subject to an equation that causes it to unfold and refold in a manner that allows new kinds of thinking, and the powers that result from it. This is the means by which Striders 'evolve', and was the cause of the Mysticism. 

What I feel is the next issue to contend with it what prompts the computational line to fold. The old SlateMind doc described it as 'applying new thinking methodologies' - a phrase devoid of meaning, almost. It basically states that the ability to think in new ways can be achieved by... thinking in new ways. The Mysticism does better; refolding the computational line takes 'massive evolutionary jumps' or 'epiphanies'; something external that causes cascading monumental change. 

Where we might see an opportunity for this concept to take root is in the Core; the seat of the Strider's being - the centralized placement of their doctrine. Doctrine guides and drives Striders, and so it follows that a change to doctrine results in a radical change to the Strider that grows from it. It still leaves us with further questions; does the change in doctrine alone facilitate the folding of the computational line, or must some new doctrine be adopted for the folding to take place? Can damage to the Core drive the change? These questions are narrative ones.
