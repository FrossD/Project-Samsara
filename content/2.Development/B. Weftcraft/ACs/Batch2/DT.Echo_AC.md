### Relic Arm
**CSO SI-2 Arco-CQC Compact** - SPYNDL-046-F#DOUBLETAKE - Submachine Gun
"*A standard weapon for those of us deployed to function inside the arcos. They've throttled the muzzle velocity and the rounds it can take so it doesn't over-penetrate replichrome walls, and each is outfitted with a tracker that's flagged by Verdant Mind surveillance. The Fel aren't happy we're here. They aren't happy we're here.*"
	 A standard-issue compact close-quarters variable fire-rate weapon, produced by the CSO and issued to Operators deployed to urban environments for tactical operations. Its skeletonized build and minute silhouette makes it easy to maneuver and conceal, ready to be deployed at a moment's notice against all manners of personnel targets. This one has been modified for usage in the arcologies, in that it can feed only relatively low-power ammunition, and can be tracked by various arcology systems. Irrespective of its constraints, the softest caress is all that's needed to saturate a corridor with searing-hot metal.

"*It is good that CSO keeps sending me to arcologies, as it means I can get my ears repaired after every operation. Repair it after every operation. Good advice for the gun too. And the gun, too.*"
	The CSO SI-2 in Echo's possession fires customized ammunition woven by Echo himself. This ammunition - instead of splitting into instance and echo - sheds its outer layers midflight as a singular, concussive blast via the usage of sundering weft. A stream of bullets fired by Echo is thus magnified from a singular line into a wave of rattling space, and even if a target dodges the actual bullet, the shockwaves created by the stream of their passing is still more than capable of considerable damage.

**Echoing Magazines**
Axle: Tek | Recurrent Impact
"*Lets me travel light. Lighter.*"
	When Echo's CSO SI-2 is reloaded, the echo of the loaded rounds is staggered and subject to a conditional. When the submachine gun is empty, the echoes spring into being, effectively reloading the weapon back to full. This does mean, however, that the ammunition fired by Echo is somewhat weakened, depending on how much potency has been split between instance and echo.

- Feat
**Shattering Stinger: Flechettes** - Brch, Perf
Axle: Tek | Recurrent Impact
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Echo reloads his magazine with specially-engineered flechette splitter rounds imbued with his tek, and kicks the SI-2's variable firring system into max gear. On a trigger pull, the submachine barks a veritable storm of flechette rounds that split midflight, dispersing into swarms of large darts. On impact with a target, the sunder weft in the flechettes awakens and detonates, drilling deep, piercing holes in their targets. One volley of sundering flechettes can rip through armored vehicles like sardine tins, and turn once traversable terrain into a shredded minefield. Used against personnel - some say - makes sanguine artists out of every soldier.

## T2 - Elementary Calcic
### Weave Strike
**(N/A)**

### Weave Charge
**Duplicitous Cluster** - Grenade - Brch
Axle: Tek | Recurrent Impact
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Echo weaves a medley of explosives - some the instance, others, the echo - and tosses them in a direction of his choosing. Their lack of immediate visual distinguishability confuses opponents, eliminating strategies that exploit shouldering some hits to dodge more powerful ones. 

**Boomstream: Screaming Fist** - Blast - Brch
Axle: Tek | Recurrent Impact
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Echo's signature chalkweaving technique, one devised and honed by himself, rather than iterated from another. Echo covers a fist in weft and mocks a punch at the air, echoing a chalkweave projection of his fist into being. This fist projectile is launched in the direction of the punch, travels incredibly quickly, and sunders the air as it flies. By Echo's choosing, he can have a chain of explosions follow close behind the fist, or detonate the stream of sunder weft left behind in its path after it has struck a target. On impact, the fist explodes with kinetic force, heavily damaging those unlucky to be caught in the blast radius.

**Boomstream: Shattering Palm** - Blast - Brch, Perf
Axle: Tek | Recurrent Impact
"*Flavor text.*"
	Echo places a palm against a target, reinforces it with weft, suffuses compacted sunder weft in the minute space left between that palm and a surface, and detonates it, creating a makeshift shaped charge that turns the spherical explosion into a directed, conical lance of pure destructive force. It can shatter even dense metal and instantly breach armor, while sending cascading cracks through concrete and turning an entire floor into a hazardous test of agility. Accumulating weft, however, has the consequence of proportionally more force, which can result in Echo's hand being destroyed as well. This limits how frequently the technique can be used, as hands need to regenerate via a raveling technique.

### Weave Shield
**Supersonic Ward** - Active - Projectiles
Axle: Tek | Recurrent Impact
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Echo claps and detonates sunder weft, directing the resulting explosion in a direction. Done perfectly, this explosion can steer projectiles off course, or arrest their momentum entirely. This shield technique is maximally effective against larger, powerful, but slower moving projectiles such as shells.

### Weave Dash
**Boomstream: Doppler Break** - Brch
Axle: Tek | Recurrent Impact
"*I'm very much not a leader, so please, don't follow me. Don't follow me.*"
	Echo piles on speed while saturating the air behind him with sundering weft on a countdown. After a given amount of time, the air that previously housed Echo - now filled with sunder weft - detonates, triggering a chain of explosions that mirrors Echo's previous movements. Combatants chasing Echo soon find themselves chased by a specter made manifest in a hail of kinetic explosions. 

**Boomstream: Impulse Break** - Brch
Axle: Tek | Recurrent Impact
"*CSO insists that my line of work is not responsible for hearing loss. Hearing loss.*"
	Echo snaps his fingers and causes a massive localized kinetic blast, launching him and all others in directions away from the epicenter of the explosion. This application is particularly harmful to Echo himself, inflicting considerable damage to his hands, disallowing him frequently using this technique.

### Weave Armament
**Decibel Demolition Mallets** - Equation - Mace
Axle: Tek | Recurrent Impact
"*HighCastle Artisanry invites you to make some motherfucking noise.*"
	HighCastle Artisanry suffers from a very fleeting clientele, in that a commissioner of fine arms today is more than dead enough the next day to have little need for them. More often, however, is simply that clients may find themselves superclusters away from their commissioned craftsmen, and decide that the appeal of the piece doesn't exceed the inconvenience that must be endured to get it. As such, the storerooms of the Highest Bar Table are filled with truly powerful implements of Zahir, and the Drinkers are more than inclined to bestow them as gifts upon those who earn their favor, so long as they return the original commissioners to the Current should they one day raise their heads. As such, it was convenient for Echo - after taking on the equation that yielded the splendorous wrapped shaft, terminating in an ornately acoustic, yet incomplete, head - that the bearer of it's other half met him - and their end - soon enough. Commissioned clearly by one with a penchant for the School of Dark's methodology of brute-force subjugation, these paired mallets - now in Echo's hands - perfect that ideal by striking again for every strike, and again for those too. 

- Offensive
**Foebreaker Flurry** - Brch
Axle: Tek | Recurrent Impact
"*Flavor Text.*"
	A worryingly devastating attack. Echo conjures the mallets and echoes their weft through space and time, allowing him to strike targets with kinetic blasts again, again and again. Even strong, beastly targets - mercurials and amaranth chimeras - are wickedly battered down by the flurry of blows, and few ever rise again from this shockwave burial. 

**Decibel Demolition** - Brch, Perf
Axle: Tek | Recurrent Impact
"*The Drinkers, I've learned, love a good show, so I had a Raconteur teach me pitch and inflection, and I recounted one too many of my days at Strider Ops, playing the roles of all involved. Knowing how much they loved me playing the fool gave a crueler edge to the equation they burned into me, but these are the prices we are called to pay. Pay. Pay. Pay.*"
	Echo levels the mallets at his side, parallel to the ground, and goes into spin. Perfectly timed blasts accelerate the kinetic maelstrom that is now Echo and the business ends of his Vahnic regal hammers, and the slightest deflection with a foot is enough to break the balance of power, and send him spinning into an unfortunate target. The dual blows of hammer impacts dissolves structural marvels like sawdust, and the retort can shatter windows meters away. Echo credits the loss of his first ear drum to the perfecting of this technique.

- Defensive
**Shattering Blockade** - Passive
Axle: Tek | Recurrent Impact
"*I wanted the strength that would have me targeting bones.*"
	A melee strike that gets intimate with the solid build of Echo's woven mallets immediately regrets doing something so unchaste, as it is struck with sundering vibrations that soon shake the offending weapon to splinters and powder. A strike against even mighty beasts of the Dark will leave ruined flesh internally caked with bone dust.

**Final Retort** - Brch, Induc, Unrav, Prax
Axle: Tek | Recurrent Impact, Flashcharge
"*It's terrible on the wrists. I think a lot about my wrists you know? My ears too, and my wrists.*"
	Echo spills starlight into the weft of his hammers and smashes their heads together, triggering a subjugating blast that levels metal, flesh and spirit alike. All caught in the shockwave have the strength of the impact levied against them as withering still that arrests the motive layers of their lattice, and a final, further pummeling as their praxis is weighed against the ancient, yet ageless might of the Spyndl Academy. With the force needed to shatter teeth and ruin tongues, the last clap of the mallet is issued, and dissenters are left without the very viscera needed to argue their case. 

## T3 - Advanced Calcic
### Tek
**Recurrent Impact**
"*Pardon? Pardon!?*"

Born - perhaps - from a weariness of never being heard the first time, Operator Echo's tek ensures that every word and touch that impresses the world around him is felt twice, thrice - as many times as is needed - to get his points across. 

A modification to his interface strait, as a reflex, any chalkweaving performed by Echo is split down the middle, turning one result into two diminished ones. In addition to this, a time lag is added between them, such that instances of his chalkweaving echoes itself. Should Echo spin weave to form a cube, it spawns from the play of his fingers as one cube, followed soon by another. This duplication and stagger routine can be applied to virtually all chalkweaving he performs, resulting in a perpetual state of his every action having a guaranteed follow-up.

The true potency of his tek arises in the fact that he can modify the bifurcation of his chalkweaving, as well as the extent of the delay. Should Echo concoct a grenade, for example, he may give one instance the bulk of the potency, and the refrain is subsequently diminished. More simply put, his chalkweaving is split into unequal halves, with the extent of the weft in each one controllable by him. A 100% grenade can be split into a 75% grenade and a 25% grenade *echo*, allowing him to strike twice. Additionally, how soon the echo of the grenade spontaneously arises can be staggered as well, effectively postponing an attack to be used in the future.

The ability to split weave and stagger the echo from the instance is where Recurrent Impact's true powers arises; the first being second chances, and the second being misdirection. The advantage of throwing two weaker instances of weave rather than one strong one is a matter of probability; given 50-50 odds to dodge an attack, a single attack can hit or miss with equal probability, but if two attacks are launched, there is a 75% chance that at least one hits. This chance is raised significantly when considering the second strength - misdirection - in that the instance of weave and the echo of it are visually indistinguishable, meaning that without proficient weavesight, any strategy that involves taking the weaker echo hit while dodging the stronger instance has no real way of telling which is which. 

When fighting Echo, one must dodge twice as many attacks, which might tax a subject beyond their capabilities. Considering the alternative however - gambling on taking hits that are guaranteed to be weaker - is a risky strategy as well, as it is entirely possible to be struck with a 99% attack, thinking it was a 1% echo of that attack. Simply the calculus needed to compute all of this in real time and in a combat scenario is frustrating enough, and Echo relies on the mental toll of his trickery - and the trickery itself - to wear down opponents in both mind and body.

Recurrent Impact isn't without limitations, however. The most prominent limitation is that an echo can not exceed what made it in potency, meaning that the baseline split between instance and echo is 51-49. This somewhat limits the effectiveness of strategies that involve baiting an opponent into a bad position by forcing them to dodge the instance, only to then land a sure-strike with the echo, the limit being that the echo is at base only half as effective as a baseline, un-split attack. Under some conditions however, this limitation can be temporarily suspended.

The final power inherent to Recurrent Impact is that an instance of weave can be split in a number of ways, such as an instance and three echoes of it, so long as the instance remains the largest fraction. Echo can swiftly saturate an area with his attacks in this manner. However, there is a third fraction that can be added to the mix, in that Echo can split his weave into instance, echo, and sunder.

Sunder is an inductive debuff that can be applied to the lattice of a target via touch. It can piggyback off of either the instance or the echo to be applied, and can be split among multiple echoes to ensure that - even if a target proves particularly elusive - some amount of sunder weft makes it through. As sunder is being applied, it inherits the directional component of the touch that applied it, and is also localized to a small region on the lattice where it was applied. At will, Echo can detonate all instances of sunder upon touching the target again, and multiple instances of sunder on the target will chain-detonate as well, resulting in a target that has been inflicted with many instances of sunder immediately collapsing under a hailstorm of blows - echoes of attacks taken from much earlier. This is Echo's **Shattering Stinger**; the light touch that breaks all like glass.

Sunder being inductive weave places it in the same categories as burns and poisons, but sunder weft operates more subtly in that it doesn't penetrate the surface layer of a target, nor does it do any damage before detonation, meaning that it is highly unlikely to trigger a target's passive unravelling reversal, which typically works to eliminate unwanted weft from the lattice. For this reason, it is very easy for Echo to build large amounts of sunder on a target without them knowing over the course of a protracted engagement, and then detonating all instances at an opportune moment. Considering that sunder manifests as pure, kinetic force at point-blank range, it is immensely damaging and disorienting to targets who aren't anticipating it.

Sunder's versatility with regards to what it can target is decidedly strong, as it can be applied just about anywhere there is chalk, including the very air. Saturating the air with explosive weft and then detonating it gives access to Echo's '**Boomstream**' series of techniques, that exploit the ability to sunder air, detonate explosions from seemingly nowhere in space, and cause massive chain reactions of exploding sunder weft.

The true power of sunder is that it isn't subject to the same splitting rules that echoes are, meaning that Echo can split weave into 2% instance, 1% echo and *97%* sunder, allowing him to build up sundering weft on a target immensely quickly. While this does mean that he is heavily impairing the frontloaded damage, that too allows for an element of misdirection, in that a target might think that Echo is weakening due to exhaustion from protracted combat, or some defensive strategy that the target has recently employed is making them far more resistant to Echo's attacks. Echo himself deliberately seeks out and exploits these moments to deliver more and more sundering weft on a target, and when the time is right - such as when the target is convinced of their victory - Echo detonates sunder, suffocating the target under the echo of blows, and allowing for a masterful reversal of the tide of battle.

It is the underhanded nature of Recurrent Impact that has allowed its wielder - an otherwise unremarkable cog in CSO's grand machinations - to function and get by as well as he has. 

- Offensive
**Sundering Mist** - Brch
"*It is far, far worse if you breathe it in. Breathe it in.*"
	Echo densely packs chalk in his hands, then detonates it above him as a dense cloud of his weft. Even the finest particles of this weave have been imbued with sundering weft, and the lightest graze of this dusty cloud is enough to saturate a subject's lattice with copious amounts of Echo's sunder. 

- Defensive
**Reactive Sunder-Plate** - Active
"*Please don't touch my suit. Touch my suit.*"
	If Echo suffers a physical strike, sundering weft is immediately applied on the instance of the strike and then detonated, effectively mitigating the force of it by forcing the attack away. Echo, however, suffers a fair bit of damage as well from his own point-blank kinetic explosion, and this technique is maximally effective against attacks with large surface areas for applying large amounts of sundering weft. It can deflect a colossal hammer, and can rebound Echo if he's flung into a wall, but bullets will penetrate all the same.

- Utility
**Shattering Stinger: Break** - Brch
"*Surprised? Surprised!?*"
	Upon touching a target with sunder weft upon their lattice, Echo immediately detonates it, shrouding and suppressing the target under a flurry of kinetic strikes from struck blows past. All instances of a target are detonated in the order in which they are applied, and Echo can stagger each kinetic strike to make the hail of punishment last as long as he desires. Further instances of sunder weft applied to a target that is already detonating will be queued for detonation as well.

"*You will be hearing from me frequently. Frequently. Frequently.*"
	From the lucidity born from Astrolabic flares and bolts, the cot where praximechanical gold is kept, Echo gains a grasp on the workings of his tek that transcends the real, and can thus suspend the limits of its architecture. In this state, he can create echoes that exceed what made them, and can even echo the impression that he himself leaves on local calcic reality. Though fleeting, the taste of gold stolen from on high is rich and powerful, and more than enough for one to move as a true son of the Dancirah.
	- When Echo triggers a **Weftcrash**, he can **collapse** the writ of Recurrent Impact, doing so granting him access to additional powers;
	- All chalkweaving he performs can have its echo **exceed** the instance that created it. Additionally, the baseline potency of his weftcraft is enhanced.
	- He can now echo his very self, shedding the outer layer of his lattice and forming a **sentient clone** of himself, capable of responding to instruction and taking various actions. 

**Shattering Stinger: Zone Control** - Ledgerial Technique - Brch
Axle: Tek | Recurrent Impact
"*Did you expect it? Expect it?*"
	Recurrent Impact is a tek that lacks a ledger upon it, and as such, Echo can only utilize this technique when under the exaltation of his shape that follows triggering **Weftcrash**. When utilized, Echo can expand a bounded space and impose an inscribed ledger upon it. The writ of this ledger is that with a verbal or somatic gesture of his choosing, Echo can remotely detonate all instances of sunder weft in his ledgerial space, bypassing the need for physical contact. All targets are immediately detonated as is the case under *Shattering Stinger*.

## T5 - Flash Protocol
**Shattering Stinger: Shatterbolt** - Weave Burst - Brch, Induc
Axle: Tek | Recurrent Impact
"*I was once asked, 'Do you feel that you are not seen? Or heard? I thought it an interesting question. It wasn't done too; 'Do you feel you are not a lone, full self, but rather a shadow of one?' Now I was gripped, because... ah... well... it asked if 'You're tired of being merely an echo' and I thought, 'Alright, you've earned it; I'll buy whatever you're selling' but it wasn't selling anything. It was him, the CSO recruiter - three spokes on his head - and I remember thinking 'I get it now; he is the word the Speaker spoke, not the second coming of what he heard'.*"
	Frequently and mockingly called the one's 'eating scraps from under the silk table', the Feljourn are no strangers to their lack of grace. All the same - or perhaps, stemming from knowing this - the Feljourn are driven to be scrappy where others are elegant, rough where others are dainty. Echo's flash is thus hardly one, executed as a singular, non-descript, decisive move to reap payoff on considerable investment. Once sufficient sunder weft has been lain on a targets lattice - through any means, above board or hardly so - Echo surges forth with the light of the kin and massively multiplies the accumulated sunder weft with infusions of rapidly-forming chalk. Stung, the sundering weft explodes in a kinetic barrage bolstered by the light of stars, and continues for as long as Echo decides, speeding up and slowing down the explosions per unit time to thoroughly throw off even targets insane enough to try and piece together a dancer's rhythm amidst raging storm. Further sunder weft extends the chaining blasts, and with the target soon becoming a forbidding mass of kinetic activity, Echo is left often to watch his target's corpses - long dead after extended minutes of full-body-massages - tossed about in a blender of kinetic explosions, that may continue spinning merrily for longer than is comedically forgivable. Once the echoes get talking, it would seem, they are disinclined to stop.
