**ScryvanTech G-42 'LAZERPAINTER'** - COLORWAY-052 - Unique Arm
"*Flavor Text.*"
	The trademark tool of the spheritect, the Matterstream Projector - colloquially called the 'Lazerpainter' is typically a colossal instrument installed in orbit of an under-construction planet and supplied with the copious amounts of crystal chalk material necessary to begin the terraforming process. Massively downsized however, creates the man-portable instrument that bears the colloquial name most commonly, and is used for various civil applications. The hulking assembly of backpack, feed tube and multicylinder, slate-controlled, sturdily-built seemed to completely eliminate all possibly of actual combat applications, but extensive modifications by Palette - ranging from skeletonization of the frame to overclocking of the weaving enginery - has produced an instrument capable of no small amount of chaos. By 'drawing' in space itself with a wide variety of solid - or not - matter as media, Palette - though hardly as trained as her opponents more often than not - earned her place on the rare battlefields where Fel are found. It is not often that Fel - Fel artists especially - are called to fight, but the spheritects are a uniquely hardy bunch - necessarily so - as chromegrafts are needed to wield the Lazerpainter, but something far greater is needed to shape planets from starstuff.

- Utility
**Lazerpainter: Line Tool**
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	The G-42 Lazerpainter is a matter projection tool that rapidly weaves chalk into desired constructs, using the backpack that both stores extra calcic reserves and interface's with the wearer's Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit tek. When using the line tool, the Lazerpainter draws a straight line of whatever element-color is 'active' or selected. This straight line manifests as a series of spheres of material strung together and painted on the canvas of open space, much like one would paint on conventional two-dimensional canvas. Matter created in this way is still subject to macro physics; solid objects fall under gravity, liquids spread out, and gases swiftly fill the space available.

**Lazerpainter: Freehand Tool**
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Wholly identical to the functionality of the line tool, but instead allows for freehand drawing of matter in 3D space. Thickness of the matter and distance from the tool itself are both configurable by Palette when using the Lazerpainter.

**Lazerpainter: Airbrush Tool**
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	An adjustment to the parameters on the Lazerpainter allows for showering a target region in space with a finely-distributed mist of element-color matter. 

**Lazerpainter: Polygon Tool**
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	An extension of the line tool, the Lazerpainter can rapidly draw lines in space out of solid matter to build simple and complex polygons.

- Feat
**Lazerpainter: Teardrop Tool**
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit, Flashcharge
"*Flavor Text.*"
	With a linkage to the straits already established, it is easy then to supply the Lazerpainter with the raw potency of the Flash Protocol. Imbued within the Lazerpainter, it activates the teardrop tool that allows for 'picking' any element-color in the vicinity via touch, and using it to paint with the Lazerpainter's other tools. Picked element-colors persist only as long as the user supplies flashcharge, and once the supply is cut off, it decays within the tool into the primary element-colors.

**Lazerpainter: Fill Tool**
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit, Flashcharge
"*Flavor Text.*"
	When using the Fill Tool, the Lazerpainter's onboard compute first checks if the targeted space in question is within a bounded space. This can be a room with the door closed and windows shut, a shoebox, a car, anywhere that is compute by the Lazerpainter as being 'bounded'. This also includes a polygon created by the Lazerpainter itself, with the added levity that for a space bounded by matter drawn by the Lazerpainter, it need not be airtight, rather only needing the wireframe mesh of a polygon made out of the Lazerpainter-created matter. Once this criteria is met, using the Fill Tool expends flashcharge to fill the entirety of the bounded space with whatever element-color is currently selected in the Lazerpainter. The flashcharge expended scales both with the size of the space and the complexity of the element-color filling it, with element-colors made of more elements taking proportionally more flashcharge. 

## T2 - Elementary Calcic
### Weave Strike
**(N/A)**

### Weave Charge
**Subduing Lash** - Blast - Induc, Brch
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Understanding her limited combat potential by virtue of the slow speed of deployment for both her tek and relic, Palette sought to create enough openings for striking opponents by arresting their mobility and ability to act. Mixing blue and green - water and earth - yields **plant**, which manifests as a lashing, grasping host of vines that ensnare targets and suffuse them with crippling poison. Targets bound in Palette's vines are both physically and chemically restrained, making them susceptible to further punishment.

**Coerced Conductance** - Blast - Perf, Unrav
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Mixing red and red - fire and fire - gives a proto-hyperweave Palette calls **shockweft**. Crackling between unstable calcic constructs in Palette's planet-shaping work, used in combat it manifests as a pure white-yellow bolt of errant, tightly-bound weft that scours targets, piercing weak defenses and inflicting considerable lattice unravelling, impairing the target's ability to wield chalk. This bolt can reform with shorn weft from a target and crackle towards another suitably chalk-dense target, turning a crowd of foes into a groaning heap.

**Iceshard Shrapnel** - Grenade - Perf, Caedo
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Mixing blue and blue - water and water - yields **ice**, which Palette encases in her weft and uses as a grenade. Additional weft is used to give detonation criteria, such as proximity, shock, or elapsed time. On detonation, razor-sharp shrapnel of hardened ice is flung in all directions, piercing and cutting its way through all matter in the vicinity.

**Sunslag Grenade** - Grenade - Brch, Induc
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Mixing red and green - fire and earth - yields **lava**. Encased in a grenade and conferred with detonation criteria, upon detonation this technique unleashes blisteringly hot lava in all directions, splashing a wide area and turning it completely impassable. The force of the blast and splashing molten rock does considerable blunt force trauma, and the sheer heat permeates and damages lattices from within. 

### Weave Shield
**Terran Bastille** - Active - Caedo, Brch, Perf
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Palette mixes green and green - earth and earth - to form **rock**. A palm slap on the ground or a tap with a foot is enough to prompt a large, thick wall of rock to form, serving as a temporary barrier against attack. 

### Weave Dash
**Nimbus Form**
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Palette mixes red and blue - fire and water - together and forms **cloud**. The shroud of vapor saturates both her lattice and the air around her, making her swift as a product of reduced gravity, and obscuring her from conventional and weft sighting methodologies.

### Weave Armament
**(N/A)**

## T3 - Advanced Calcic
### Tek
**Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit**
"*Try not to be too generous with the red.*"

A tek designed and sequenced by the Soleri Spheritects, working alongside weave-spinning Minds. It is used in the shaping of worlds.

Rather than being a singular equation, this highly-regarded feat of calcic engineering is a fistful of many equations working in tandem, somewhat ousting it from the conventional moniker of 'tek', while placing it under the vanishingly small umbrella of teks that bear the designation 'G5C' or 'fifth generation gamma' teks.

The Trichromatic Terraforming Kit tek is a tek engineered for expediting the task of crafting planets. The Spheritects are a guild of cosmological craftsmen whose domain are planets and planetary equations. The crafting of planets as done by the Spheritects is primarily done by mixing the elements of fire, earth and water in manners reminiscent of ancient alchemy. The TTT facilitates this by seamlessly handling the conversion of massive amounts of chalk into these primary elements.

The true power of the Tek, however, is that it treats these elements as colors - red for fire, green for earth and blue for water - and in turn allows for the mixing of the colors, thus translating into a 'mixing' of the elements. This allows the 'primary colors' of fire, earth and water to yield the 'secondary colors' of cloud, lava and plant. Repeated with different combinations and further combinations, such as tertiary 'colors', gives the spheritect a full palette with which to terraform bare balls of rock into frozen tundra, lush grassland, and screaming volcanoes - all three, something in between, or none at all.

Without the planetary equation to sustain it, however, all element colors created by this tek are spontaneously reduced to calcic ribbon after an amount of time as a product of their weft instability, making the tek's translation to non-planet-shaping practice - combat - somewhat hampered. This is perhaps for the best, however, as it allows the wielder of the tek to replenish lost chalk from harvesting the remains of their decayed constructs, as well as conferring upon them a blank canvass with which to paint more, greater things as they see fit.

The true power of the Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit comes from the sheer diversity of element-colors it can create, stemming from second and third stages of color mixing. These yield - in addition to the **secondary** element-colors - **duplicate**, **triplicate**, **tertiary** and **mirror** groups of element-colors. The usage of element-colors is primarily with the spheritect's paintbrush - the typically orbitally-mounted Matterstream Projector, more colloquially called the '**Lazerpainter**', downsized for usage in the hands of personnel. However, element-colors can be woven from the hands as well - as facilitated by the tek - and used as the material components of chalk rituals, and the Flash Protocol.

Below are the element-color mixing tables that show which combination of element-colors yield what, and the categories they all belong to.

**Primary**
- Fire - Red
- Earth - Green
- Water - Blue

**Secondary**
Two differing colors.
- Fire + Earth = **Lava**
- Earth + Water = **Plant**
- Water + Fire = **Cloud**

**Duplicate**
Two identical colors.
- Fire + Fire = **Shockweft**
- Earth + Earth = **Rock**
- Water + Water = **Ice**

**Triplicate**
Three identical colors.
- Fire + Fire + Fire = **Hyperweave**
- Earth + Earth + Earth = **Mountain**
- Water + Water + Water = **Glacier**

**Mirror**
A *secondary* color, plus the leftover color.
- Water + Lava = **Obsidian**
- Fire + Plant = **Ash**
- Earth + Cloud = **Clay**

**Tertiary (Sunrise)**
A *secondary* color, plus one of the constituent colors.
- Fire + Lava = **Magma**
- Earth + Plant = **Moss**
- Water + Cloud = **Hail**

**Tertiary (Sunset)**
A *secondary color*, plus the *other* constituent color.
- Fire + Cloud = **Geyser**
- Earth + Lava = **Mineral**
- Water + Plant = **Wood**

**Quaternary**
All three colors, but mixed with higher things.
- Fire + Earth + Water + Stardust = **Cataclysm**

A few limitations exist on this tek however. The first and most prominent one is mentioned above; matter created by this tek's weaving it into being is unstable and soon decays into chalk dust. Only the presence of a planetary equation curtails this effect. The second limitation is that created matter can not be mixed further when it has been projected out into space. Only within the lattice can the mixing of element-colors by the tek take place.

- Offensive
**Sunset Chromatic Alchemy: Geyserblast** - Cado, Perf, Induc
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Mixing **fire** and **cloud** in the weaving hands yields **geyser**, manifesting as a massively-pressurized globule of water and steam that erupts outwards from the palms as a piercing, searing pseudo-laser. Targets struck are heavily burned and have their lattice split and torn by the high-power beam of pressurized liquid.

**Sunrise Chromatic Alchemy: Hailstorm** - Brch
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Mixing **water** and **cloud** give **hail**, taking the form of a tower of vapor that flings chunks of ice from its epicenter. Palette is able to direct its movements in three directions, and the hailstorm will persist for an amount of time or until Palette dismisses it, flinging crushing hailstones at anyone close by, friend and foe alike.

- Defensive
**Sunset Chromatic Alchemy: Woodland Bastille** - Cado, Brch, Perf
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Mixing **water** and **plant** yields wood, and from Palette's feet, thick evergreens germinate, sprout, grow and mature, forming a solid wall of dense plant matter. Targets behind the trees are obscured from various forms of sight, and the trees themselves are incredibly resistant to physical attack. They, however, suffer from all the weaknesses one would imagine a wall of trees would.

- Utility
**Sunrise Chromatic Alchemy: Rejuvenating Greenery**
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Mixing **earth** and **plant** yields **moss**, this moss being special in that it contains a powerful **reverse unravelling technique**. Targets that ingest or touch the moss have their lattice repair greatly accelerated, at the expense of the integrity of the moss. This technique in particular expends considerably more chalk to perform. 

- Burst
**Noon Chromatic Alchemy: Sunslag Eruption** - Induc, Brch, Perf, Cado
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Mixing **fire** and **earth** with **lava** yields **magma** and **minerals** respectively. When combined into a complex, they form a highly unstable pyroclastic construct that is at risk of violent detonation at any moment. Only conscious containment with chalkweave stops it from erupting into mineral fragments and molten rock. When ready, Palette can fling this bottle catastrophe in a given direction, resulting in a ruinous explosion of volcanic matter in all directions. Targets are burned heavily and suffer considerable physical damage to their lattice.

### Quis
- **Sunrise Chromatic Ritualism: Starsmite** - Perf, Unrav, Induc
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Palette calls forth a qui-wheel of the spheritects, stratified and decorated with orbital trajectories and equation writ. She fills it with components, including mixing **fire**, **fire** and **fire** again to yield **hyperweave**. Upon cast, a pure-white bolt of hyperweave crackles from Palette's hands towards a target, heavily striking their lattice with powerful discordant chalk, stripping material and inflicting heavy unravelling, as well as an inductive stun that arrests the target's actions momentarily. This bolt can chain between targets as well, ripping through lattices as it travels.

## T4 - Grand Calcic
### Rituals
**Sunset Chromatic Ritualism: Reconstruction** - Channel
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Mixing **earth** and **cloud** creates a highly aerated and pliable **clay**. With it, Palette declares a site of ritual geometry, expanding outwards under her will. Expending components including this clay allows for the casting of a powerful **reverse unravelling technique** on either herself or a target, so long as the ritual cast is maintained. This cast in particular can repair extensive damage.

**Sunset Chromatic Ritualism: Blackglass Bulwark** - Cast
Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Mixing **water** and **lava** yields the glossy-black **obsidian**. When utilized in a declared site of ritual geometry alongside various components, Palette is able to confer either herself or a target with a covering of shimmering volcanic glass, functioning as a passive shield. Any physical strikes against the target must first wear through the black glass, and the target themselves can will the covering to project black glass spikes at close targets, spearing them and inflicting perforant damage. 

### Extended Disciplines
**Names** - Subclass (Barrier Technique, Ledgerial Technique, Praxis Imposition, Apex Weaving, Collapse Function) - Damage Type
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Description

**Onurian Imposition: Ageless Craftsman** - Praxis Imposition
"*Flavor Text.*"
	The one who built the Slates that allowed the early Third Kin to take the battle to the First Thinkers in the dawning of their era - Skydancer Onuris, the Hammer - finds themselves enamored with all manners of craft. It is no surprise then that despite being majorly Fel-populated, the Skydancer and his apostolics have taken interest in the work of the Soleri and the Spheritects. The prospect of tapping into ancient powers proved incredibly seductive, and Palette - much like many other spheritects - has taken on an imposition under the Skydancer Onuris. This imposition splits the powers that Palette has access to, but in return confers upon her access to a ledgerial technique.
	- Palette operates within the constraints of a **metronome** construct upon her computational strait that oscillates between states of **sunrise** and **Sunset**. Depending on which state she is in, she is restricted to using only certain categories element-colors provided to her by her Tek. Primary, Secondary and Quaternary element-colors are not subject to this imposition.
	- In **Sunrise** state, she can only form the element-colors under the **Tertiary (Sunrise)** and **Triplicate** categories.
	- In **Sunset** state, she can only form the element-colors under the **Tertiary (Sunset)** and **Mirror** categories.
	- Expending **flashcharge** allows for temporarily suspending this limitation, allowing for performing **Noon** techniques.

**Noon Chromatic Alchemy: Howls of Ash** - Consecration - Siph
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Operating under the grace of a Skydancer, Palette is granted a ledger, which she can impose on a barrier to erect a bounded ledgerial space. In place of using plain woven chalk to form the barrier, Palette mixes **earth** and **water** with themselves three times, yielding **mountain** and **glacier**, massive constructs that denote the boundary of Palette's consecrated grounds. Mixing **fire** and **plant** yields **ash**. The writ on the ledger given to Palette is in fact, a **planetary equation**, and in the presence of planetary equation, the matter created by her tek does not decay. Targets caught in the swirling ash suffused into the bounded ledgerial space gradually have their chalk drained, and the ash, as well as the mountain and glacier barriers persist so long as the ledger does. If a target is unable to breach the mountain or glacier walls - thereby suspending the ledger in effect - the ash will drain the chalk from their lattice and straits until nothing remains.

## T5 - Flash Protocol
**Fel Cataclysm** - Weave Burst - Brch, Cado, Perf, Comp
Axle: Axle: Tek | Trichromatic Terraforming Toolkit
"*Flavor Text.*"
	The **Mirror** category of element-colors features compound element-colors that make use of all three primary elements - red fire, green earth and blue water. But it is with the addition of power from the Flash Protocol as a catalyst that all three element-colors, when collision-mixed in just the right manner, yield the element-color of **cataclysm**. Boasting a stomach-churning black hue, cataclysm is an indelicate, chaotic, formless force that is invoked only when something that is no longer needed must be erased, relinquishing its place to something more desirable. Harnessed by Palette, she can propel concentrated blasts of inky-black cataclysm at a target, dealing all manners of physical punishment as the cataclysm morphs and reshapes itself at the target's expense, while also permeating their straits and attacking the equations within. Used primarily to wipe a spheritect's planetary slate clean, on a denizen of the Switchboard it is a uniquely terrible fate to suffer.
