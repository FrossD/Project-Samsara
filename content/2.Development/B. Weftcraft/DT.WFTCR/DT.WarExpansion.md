# Weave and Warfare Expansion
Expansions of Weave and Warfare, following the original document, and thus tackling what it handles rather than subject matter better suited for more dedicated documents such as the Extended and Martial Disciplines.

## Speculative
Speculative additions to the writ.

### Weapons
####  Honkai Impact 3
Weapons from HI3

**Fucking Combat Yoyos**
[Drive Cores - Official Honkai Impact 3 Wiki (fandom.com)](https://honkaiimpact3.fandom.com/wiki/Drive_Cores)

Would probably rename them to 'vortex cores' or something along those lines. They'd be a depths-aligned weapon primarily, in the midrange, low range band, built for bludgeoning. Damage would come from power accumulated via spin, and spin would be achieved using curvature manip, which would in turn help with directing them and accentuating strikes.

Could also have the string be used for cutting/cado attacks.

Very cool utility of them being used as grappling hooks and skateboards too.


**Crossbows? Rapid Crossbows??**
[Rapid-Shot Crossbows - Official Honkai Impact 3 Wiki (fandom.com)](https://honkaiimpact3.fandom.com/wiki/Rapid-Shot_Crossbows)

Cool I guess. I think that hand cannons would just see considerably more utility though.

**Rocket Pistols**
