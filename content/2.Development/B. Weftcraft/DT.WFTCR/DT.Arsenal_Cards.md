# Drafting Table: Arsenal Cards
The drafting table for various characters and their arsenal cards.

## Workshop - Meta
Development of the arsenal card concept itself.

### Consolidated ACs.
> I'm honestly planning a second pass at how ACs work and build out something we're referring to internal as CACs or 'Consolidated Arsenal Cards'.
> It's a novel arsenal design doctrine where I greatly slim down the tiers each has from five to three.
> - Chalkstriders get their **Tek(T3), Rituals(T4) and Flash Protocol(T5)**. 
> - Depthstriders get their **Curvature Manipulation(T2), Draws from the Void(T3), and Deep Hollow(T4)**. 
> - Pale Amarans get their **T2/3 Polar White and Black powers, and their T5 Full Spectra**.
> - Each class keeps their T1s, though characters will usually only have **one weapon**.
> - T0 is replaced with an generalized **martial arts proficiency**.

The reason for this is pushing for greater differentiation between combatants in the Switchboard, by laying greater emphasis on their powers that **cannot traditionally be replicated** by other parties in the Switchboard. It also helps to expedite the development of arsenal cards, as well as make them easier to deploy in narrative for characters not maximally critical to plot.

It does, however, shrink the amount of flavor in each card considerably, as well as wipe out a number of very valuable slots for abilities.

> There is a case for using one to develop the other when needed; CACs can be extrapolated into ACs, and ACs condensed to CACs.

Under the Consolidated ACs are two types;
- **Type A CACs**: These CACs follow something of a '**linchpin** design doctrine'. At the crux of this is building CACs around the character or superclass' **most integral ability**, which serves as the 'linchpin' upon which all other entries in their AC can hinge upon. For Chalkstriders, this is their **T3 - Tek**, for Depthstriders, their **T2 - Curvature Manipulation** and for Pale Amarans, their **T2/3 White and Black** powers.
- **Type B CACs**: A CAC that is created by taking an existing AC and **stripping down** the number of entries to an arbitrarily chosen amount. This can be required in canon for fairly rare instances where their power constraints upon actors, or - more commonly - used outside of canon by myself for various purposes, such as theorycrafting relative AC strength.  

### Secondary ACs
With the development of [[Extended Disciplines]], I have the idea of **Secondary Arsenal Cards** that contain techniques used by - narratively - too wide an array of people to be unique to a particular character as their regular Arsenal Card's - now called the **Primary AC** - techniques are.

Secondary ACs for now would contain
- Reverse Unravelling Techniques
- Barrier Techniques
- Sealing Techniques
- Mistweave Techniques
- Impositions
- Advanced Playbook Techs

Generally all of the extended disciplines.

#### Great Family Motifs
> A rather reductionist but still useful way of looking at the great families and how that translates to the arsenal cards.

All four great families have a number of defining motifs, emerging as a product of both deliberate and emergent placement in various positions in the verse. The combination of their various defining characteristics translates to broad but not rigorous design guidelines for arsenal cards of persons from a given great family. As such;

- The **Sil'khan** favor **speed**. Their power of the strider protocol and possession of the stride-dedicom means that they can expedite the more cumbersome aspects of weaving chalk and instead exercise their combat potential through high mobility and speed of casting and deployment. The tradeoff of speed versus power is made up for by the fact the Sil'khan are frequently in possession of strong Teks and primarily close and midrange relics for use in battle, with activation criteria that play into being fast and aggressive.

- The **Fel-Arcad** pursue **technique**. Innate proficiency over the weave protocol coupled with decidedly studious natures and ideal environments for pursuing that study has shaped the Fel into practitioners of robust calcic feats. Losing out on the stride-dedicom and thus speed, the Fel make up for it using complex techniques with considerable payoffs, harnessing hyperweave, barrier techs and the chalk ritualism. The problem of being slow to deploy their powers is made up for by keeping distance from opponents, and thus the Fel are fond of ranged weaponry.

- The **Vahnkin** employ **strength**. Perhaps the most immediate and prevalent hazard that faces all in the Void is its immense, crushing gravity. Over generations, the Vahnkin have adapted to this inescapable weight via the passive and active cultivation of musculature, and a positive consequence of it is that sojourns into the Dancirah where this burden is lifted leaves the Vahnkin categorically stronger than most. Coupled with their powers of gravity and the the ability to call forth aid from the Void, the Vahnkin specialize in raw subjugation potential, breaking opponents with mass and numbers.

- The **Lancasters** possess **resilience**. Being the least-blessed of all great families in the Switchboard, the Lancasters have had to adapt faster and learn quickly on how to hold their own. But this lack of blessing upon them has been a blessing in and of itself, in that the Lancasters are intrinsically more resilient to some of the more subtle edges of the Switchboard such as the star's sundering starblight, the Void's caustic stardrip, the ripping perfection of glass, and more. Through raw endurance cultivated over processions of thriving under uniquely harsh conditions, they work to outlast opponents while slowly whittling them away with a repertoire of pilfered and self-developed tools, techniques and tactics.


## Workshop - Forge
For building brand new arsenal cards for characters, and reworking old ones.

### Adven Ventura
New Ventura loadout is centered around the **stance transition** built into his Relic Firearm: the **Sojourner's Tale**. These stances are the **Marksman** and **Gambler** stances, where 'Marksman' focuses on using Ventura's Tek, the **Trajectory Calculator** to dispense highly-accurate fire over long distances, while 'Gambler' makes use of a **pact** with a Skydancer to trade accuracy for damage. Certain parts of Ventura's loadout are now only usable when in certain stances, or are modified depending on the stance.

> Marksman Stance is indicated with **MS**.
> Gambler Stance is indicated with **GS**.

#### Reworks
**Relic Martial Arm**
- [x] The relic **Feat** is now the **Stance Transition**.
- [x] **Compression Chamber** is now under **MS**.
- [x] **Second Cylinder** is now under **GS**.
- [x] **Sidewinder Feed System** is now moved under **Utility**.
	- [x] **Sidewinder Feathergrips** is now under **GS**.
	- [x] **Sidewinder Feed System** is now under **GS**.

**Weave Dash**
- [x] **Marksman's Gambit** is now **Gunfighter's Gambit**
	- [x] It now axles upon the Relic Firearm
	- [x] It now behaves differently based on the active **Stance**
		- [x] In MS, projectiles caught in the field generate ballistics data, but don't refill the magazine of the currently held weapon
		- [x] In GS, projectiles caught in the field generate ammunition for the active weapon, but no ballistic data

**Tek**
- [x] His Tek **Burst** is fully deprecated, instead realized as the Relic Defensive.

**Weave Charge**
- **Interceptor Flechette** can only be performed in MS.

#### New
**Relic Martial Arm**
- [x] The Sojourner's Tale gains a Relic **Defensive**
	- [x] **Sidewinder's Fire Veil** creates a passive shield around the user that intercepts oncoming fire using weave. This can be cast on others as well.
	- [x] This can only be used under **MS**. Transiting Stance dismisses all active instances of the inductive effect that is the Fire Veil.

**Stance Transition**
Manipulating the ritualism in the Sojourner's Tale allows for transiting active forms on the hand cannon. 

- [x] **Marksman Stance** uses Ventura's **Tek** as an Axle, and attacks made while MS is active generates **Ballistics Data**, that is usable in other parts of Ventura's loadout.
- [x] **Gambler Stance** invokes a **Skydancer Pact** with Skydancer Leilani, The Reveler. The tenets of this pact is that Ventura may not use his Tek to enhance the accuracy of his shots, and in return, his shots gain a considerable boost to damage.

**Weave Charge**
- [x] Ventura gains a new Weave Charge, **Fan the Hammer**
	- [x] This technique weaves a phantom striking hammer on whatever firearm is in Ventura's hands, and allows for fanning this hammer to fire considerably faster on weapons with slow fire-rates.
	- [x] This can only be performed in GS.

**Flash Protocol**
- [x] Ventura gains his third Flash Protocol, **Reveler Rounds**.


### Blakk
A rebuild of the T4 and T5 in lieu of major mechanical revisions to the workings of the Deep and Crescent Hollows

Deep Hollow has two forms;
- Build
	- Heavy poison inductive gas mechanic (sultanic strike)
	- Needs time to build up before triggering its effects
	- Blakk is incentivized to keep people in her domain until it dos

- Instant
	- Imposition to perform an act of engineering
	- Success collapses the domain, allowing escape
	- Failure causes instant strike of gas at 2.5x potency

Environmental Hazards

## Workshop - Ideas
A dump for motifs, themes and ideas to build various character's combat styles and thus arsenal cards out of and around.

> Relevant reading; [[Weave and Warfare]]

### #1: Red Weftworks
Tek-based power that allows for massive compression of the potential strait, allowing all chalk fed to the computational strait to be fed as **hyperweave**. It takes on an uncharacteristic red hue (relevant to the character) and allows for high-octane energy blast style chalkweaving.

- Tek
	- Offensive
		- Red Pistole
		- Red Ryfle
		- Red Blasta
		- Red Kannon (Flash Prot?)

### #2: Tats and Brands
Tek-based power revolving around hyper-compressed rituals that can be placed on calcic entities. Wielders manifest needle like extensions on their fingers that allow for deposition of colored chalk and the formation of rituals. Tats or tattoos can be placed on the caster and allies to give positive effects, while brands are forced on enemies and inflict maluses. 

### #3: Tempo Theft
A tek that functions via stealing motive weave from moving objects in a wholly unbalanced manner, allowing the wielder to greatly accelerate themselves at the expense of others.

### #4. All-Stars
A tek that buffs the wielder via siphoning the chalk of others when they use their most powerful, flashiest abilities.


## Workshop - The Slag Pit
Deprecated bits from arsenal cards.

### Hex
- [[Hex_AC]]
Stolen Armament - Black | Offensive
**Spiraling Charge** - Cado, Brch, Comp
*"The beasts of Isalveh dictated the rules of battle. And so I learned."*
	Ellaine can perform a charge, leaping at its apex to spin and gore a target with their crystalline horns, doing heavy piercing damage and breaching armor. On strike, they are afflicted with Ellaine's **witchfire**, which burns away at their computational strait and inhibits their ability to strategize, perform advanced techniques of either white or black, and exercise various mental faculties.

### Fyre/Cendyr
Tek - Starfire Conduit - Burst
**Lunarstrikes** - Cado, Brch, Induc, Siph
Axle: Martial Arm | 1530 Centigrade
*"Now cometh the age of the stars."*
	Ashflame is suffused into a weapon, and a series of powerful, sweeping cuts are made against a target, shattering their defenses, inflicting inductive cold-burns, and siphoning a considerable amount of chalk. This attack can only be performed when the starfire reserves are majorly filled with ashflame. Upon cast, half of all ashflame expended is refunded as starfire in the reserves.


### Example: Adven Ventura (Deprecated)
> A sample AC from an older, now deprecated framework.

A case study/example outline of a Character Arsenal using Adven Ventura.

**Mundane - Tier 1**
- Martial Arm: **Tritanium Longsword** (MOD Relic Longsword)
- Firearm: **Sojourner's Tale** (MOD Relic Hand cannon)
- Tertiary: **Praxlance**
**Notes**
	The Sojourner's Tale is an eight-shot hand cannon made to order and refit for unparalleled accuracy. It fires specialized 'keyhole' rounds spun from ribbon by Ventura himself.

**Elementary Calcic - Tier 2**
- Weave Strike: **Priming Bolt**
	  A ranged calcic attack. Chalk is spun into the shape of bolt and flung at a target with high speed and accuracy. On impact, it does critical damage to armor and inflicts a lattice vulnerability to piercing attacks.
- Woven Charges: 
	- **Saboteur's Charge**
	  A grenade is woven from chalk. It resembles a small cube that can be thrown from the hand or attached to surfaces, where it lies in wait for targets. On detonation, it violently unweaves into sound and light, deploys a slowing field that affects all targets within and a electrical pulse that targets weapons with onboard computational systems, slates and chromegrafts.
	  - **Interceptor Flechette**
	A grenade is woven and tossed, resembling a small sphere that can be thrown from the hand. When the fuse expires, it uses Ventura's Tek to calculate the path of various projectiles moving within its blast radius. Upon detonation, it fires out a swarm of flechette projectiles that intercept them, knocking them off course.
- Knit-Shield: **Projectile Net**
	  A field projected from an outstretched hand. This shield ability manifests as a net of chalk ribbon that arrests the momentum of any projectiles fired at it. The momentum stolen from them can be turned into calcic charge.
- Weft Dash: **Calculated Leap**
	Ventura performs a highly calculated jump, simulating all major and minor movements required to move through a space and the exact amount of chalk that must be flared to produce enough velocity to perform it, and land at an exact position. This leap takes into consideration all possible obstacles to his flight using his Trajectory Calculator, allowing him to leap through swarms of moving projectiles (such as hailstorm of bullets) without issue.
- Woven Armament: **Stabilizer Lattice**
	When Ventura wields a firearm, weave keeps it firmly in his grip, transferring firing control and recoil compensation to his entire body rather than solely his arm. This allows for making immensely accurate shots, and doing so repeatedly with very little accuracy loss over time.

**Advanced Calcic - Tier 3**
- Tek: **Trajectory Calculator**
	  A passive **modification** Tek that grants the ability to lock on to, track and calculate the path and strike location of any projectile in motion. Deploying an invisible graduated lattice creates a three-dimensional spatial ruler that allows for calculating and thus predicting the path of a projectile. If Ventura aims his pistol, he is able to predict where the shot will land. If he sees an incoming projectile, he is able to intercept it with a shot of his own. It sees its true power in its ability to calculate **rebounds**; in addition to calculating where a projectile will strike, he can also calculate the trajectory the projectile will take when it ricochets. This allows Ventura to - rather uncannily - bank shots off surfaces to shoot at targets around corners.
- Qui: **Hardpoint Calcic Rounds**
	  Ventura summons a qui-wheel, feeds it (ritual components) and eight rounds of ammunition for his hand cannon, transforming them into hardpoint calcic rounds. These shots rebound off targets irrespective of the hardness of the struck surface, and can do so a number of times. Due to their hard tips, they can also pierce targets, and can continue on their path, rebound and strike the same target again. Hardpoints do considerably more damage to targets that have piercing vulnerabilities inflicted upon them. 
- Qui: **Unravelling Rounds**
	  Ventura summons a qui-wheel, feeds it (ritual components) and eight rounds of ammunition for his hand cannon, transforming them into unravelling rounds. These rounds inflict an amount of chaos to the lattices of Striders and Weavers, inflicting unravelling upon them, but not doing much by way of physical damage. These rounds are used more to sabotage an enemy combatant, or as a way to suppress a target for capture.

**Ultimate Calcic - Tier 4**
- Flash Protocol: **Ricochet Barrage**
	  Ventura weaves eight hardpoints, then flashcharges the Sojourner's Tale hand cannon, his Tek, and all eight hardpoint rounds. The flashcharge rapidly accelerates the matter of the rounds, turning them into partially energy ammunition (as is fired from Axxel weaponry), granted them a massively increased ability to pierce. Flashcharging his hand cannon allows it to fire with unrivalled accuracy, as well as confers additional muzzle velocity on the accelerated hardpoints. Flashcharging his Tek allows him to calculate many, many rebounds deep for multiple projectiles. Ventura - within the space of a fraction of a second - then calculates and fires all eight rounds, such that they fly, strike, pierce and ricochet of any number of surfaces, flying, striking and piercing the target again and again, until they are shredded to pieces by gunfire.
- Signature Ritual: **Safe Passage**
	  Ventura draws a chalk circle and performs a ritual, expending an amount of components. All within the effective range of the ritual have their effective information mass lowered, allowing them to stride further and carry more cargo. 

**Auxiliary Powers**
- Doctrinal Power (Tier 3): **Doctrine of Strength**
	  A passive ability granted to Ventura due to his unwavering confidence in the power of strength. Attacks he makes against targets weaker than him do more damage, and calcic dividends are extracted from them to fuel his own abilities. Additionally, even when critically unraveled, Ventura is still able to accumulate chalk and empower his base weapons with it.
- Doctrinal Power (Tier 1): **The Sil'khan**
	  Ventura's pride in his Sil'khan roots empowers him. When fighting away from home, Ventura's abilities are empowered. When fighting on new frontiers, in Vaults or in different planes, Ventura is further empowered. 
- Titular Power (Tier 3): **The Strider Sojourner**
	  Ventura's notoriety earned by virtue of his ability to seemingly traverse the Switchboard under any conditions has empowered his Strider Protocol. Ventura is able to passively accumulate chalk mid-stride, and can no longer fall into the Void. This passive chalk accumulation allows for extending the distances he can stride, as well as replace momentum lost due to travel. 

### Blakk
T4 - Deep Hollow
The win state for Blakk within her Hollow is for the other parties in it with her to not notice that the lever controlling the ventilation systems is flung down, thus disabling the exhaust fans and rendering her workshop unsafe to work within. Should parties in the workshop perform any welding while the ventilation system remains off, they are immediately struck by the massively toxic fumes from vaporizing flux, causing them to sustain a **heavy inductive poison** that tears through their lattice, as well as **computational damage that inhibits their performance of chalkweaving and other abilities**, heavy **unravelling that further restricts any calcic casting**, and finally a heavy dose of **praxis sundering that weakens them, their allies, and connected parties** even further. At this point, Blakk may complete her own assembly of the metal box - with a gas mask equipped - and thus fulfill the Binding of her Basilica, causing it to resolve and collapse.

The intricacies of Blakk's Basilica Binding is that a single box must be assembled before the Hollow can resolve, and thus Blakk is incentivized by the logic of her Hollow and derivative battle strategy to never weld first. If she does, and doesn't weld with either a gas mask on or after turning on the ventilation, she will be struck by her own poisonous flux vapors, and indicate to those within the Hollow that something must be done to nullify the danger posed by gas in an enclosed space.

Should the other parties discover that the workshop is poorly ventilated, resolve the problem and complete their assembly of the metal box, the Hollow resolves, leaving them unmolested and Blakk with no advantage gained, and a considerable one lost as Blakk's Hollow has little effect on those who've defeated it once before.

**T3 - Major**
- **Contraption #5 - The Black Ice Shield**
*"By all metrics, my finest work."*
Otherwise dull metals are melted and fused to form pristine alloy, and the incants of the dwellers in the Dark, the riftlock arbiters of the Deep, and the daughter-born scorn-bearers of the Sky are stamped into its make. Around its edges are a lip of violet amara, rime and ash gathering on its vertices, effused from the underwhere. Gripped with the conviction implicit to its making, blackened frost springs forth, granting shape to the buckler. Its lattice quakes at the ever-present possibility of its own unmaking.
	Tooled and shaped in the deepest dark of the Void, Blakk's **Black Ice Shield** has attained void-hallowed status, becoming a weapon that evangelizes the word of the Amaranth Daughters. In its usage, it spawns Blakk's signature **black ice**, a crystalline hybrid complex of amaranthite and packed water-ice. **When struck**, it **assimilates the momentum of the strike**, and dissipates it within its crystal structure, **shattering explosively with proportional force**.
	- Rather than being Re-Innovated under Blakk's **Formshift: Innovation Routine**, the Black Ice Shield can only be summoned **after all four others of Blakk's Contraptions are active**, requires **having more than 20 innovation charges**, and is always in **hacked** state, adding one point to the hack counter. Using the powers provided by the Black Ice Shield adds **virtual charge** to the hack counter, building it beyond cap. 
	- The Black Ice Shield, however, consumes a number of **innovation charges** to perform its abilities, and is returned to the Void when the innovation charge counter is depleted to **twenty charges**.
- Offensive
**Winter's Throw** - Brch
*"Catch."*
	Blakk throws the Black Ice Shield. Targets struck with it are encased in black ice, and the shield rebounds between targets, seeking out the strongest - calcically-determined - and working down from there, rebounding between a maximum of three targets. The shield can be recalled back to Blakk at will.
	- This ability consumes **4 Innovation Charges**.
- Offensive
**Glacial Quake** - Cado, Brch
*"Watch out for falling rocks."*
	Blakk slams the edge of the shield in the ground, causing a cascading wave of jagged black ice to emanate in a cone before her, ripping through and freezing any targets caught in its effective radius.
	- This ability consumes **6 Innovation Charges**.
- Offensive
**Cold Shoulder**
*"Please remember that teeth are small objects and are expectedly a choking hazard."*
	Blakk charges and then rams a target frontally with the full brunt of the shield. Struck targets are encased in black ice, targets that are already encased in black ice are shattered, causing it to explode.
	- This ability consumes **3 Innovation Charges**.
- Defensive
**Artificer's Parry**
*"Nothing quite like seeing gears mesh so nicely together."*
	Blakk performs a swipe with the shield, with the aim of wholly nullifying an attack. Performed perfectly, the attack is nullified, the attacker or striking projectile is encased in black ice, and Blakk reaps **an amount of innovation points proportional to the severity of the attack.**
	- This ability consumes **10 Innovation Charges**.
- Utility
**Shattering Bulwark**
*"A failsafe is an essential."*
	If the Black Ice Shield is struck with an attack strong enough to utterly destroy it, or after taking enough damage it, it explodes violently into a massive glacier of black ice.
