# Spot Lore Tracker
In developing many other docs, workable lore that can even make it to final iterations are created on the spot. This is a doc for tracking them, based on the document of their origin, and their final destinations.

## Martial Disciplines
[[Martial Disciplines]]
- **Rosenthalist faction known as the Roslettes**
	- Practice the Roslette Style
	- Very much implied to be your usual mob/crime family
	- Have the idea they've infiltrated much of Fel-Arcad society
- **Fel-Arcad ceremonies make use of the felkr weapons**
	- Worth mentioning in the Rituals and Periodicals section of the Fel-Arcad document
- **Cyrculian Bluescor**; the first named bit of named alcohol in the Switchboard
	- Demands a little story behind it
	- Cyrcul is an astrolabic sphere
	- Lancaster Innovations, but their fine goods department
- The first bit of **Trevelyan Lore** here
	- Very essential to refer back here in the building of [[DT.SpyndlNoon]]
	- There's a disconnect between the portrayal of Trevelyan here and the story of Trevelyan in Spyndl Noon; to rectify that I had the idea of the 99 Tales being completed and the 100th Tale being Trevelyan's mind finally coming undone due to the damage of the Refrain, and him needing to be put down for it
	- Trevelyan's Trevelers do it. It's a sad tale.

## Weave and Warfare
[[Weave and Warfare]]

## pNarrat: The Samsara Protocol
> Something speculative. Take with considerable helpings of salt.

It is theorized that there exists means to escape the Current. That through some method, a Strider could enter the Current - alive and wholly, lattice intact - be unspooled and then rewoven back to their selves - body renewed - and return to life. It is theorized that the machinery for this is a structure or the like simply called the '**Outer Path**'. It is - expectedly - among the highest secrets pondered by calcic kind.
