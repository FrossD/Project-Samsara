## ### GD: Thoughts Repository

- [ ] ---
- [ ] Thoughts and new concepts to incorporate into the Samsara canon. While thoughts had are stored here, they may not necessarily make it into the Samsara canon.
- [ ] **Sentiments**
	
	- 1 Timothy 4:13-14
	- The defining line of the book(?); tradition is not the worship of ashes, but the preservation of fire.
	- "Fear the wrath of the patient man, and respect the elder in a profession where men die young."
	- Dare mighty things.
	- Love Elementalism: [https://www.vxtiktok.com/t/ZPR7mL1PT/](https://www.vxtiktok.com/t/ZPR7mL1PT/ "https://www.vxtiktok.com/t/ZPR7mL1PT/")
- [ ] **Miscellaneous**
	
	
	- X,Y and Z axis for something; the zen-harmonius, zen-melodic and zen-(something). Just sounds cool; literally have no idea what to turn this into.
- [ ] #### Brand Dev
	- Separate Samsara and Fross sites.
	- Think of what to do with the twitter.
- [ ] ### Reflecting on the Offshore
	- Consider moving **Instrument Six** from [[Glass]] to [[SB_Technology]] under the tech repo.
	- Check for the writings under Horology.


## ### GD: Administration

- [ ] ---
- [ ] Revisions to existing canon, and the restructuring of existing documents to more useable formats. Entries under here are slightly less urgent than those in active development, but works here cannot be neglected as they often appear hear due to errors in continuity between old canon and new.
	
	Additionally, notes pertaining to administrative affairs are placed here.
- [ ] #### Revisions/REV
	
	Revisions to existing canon, particularly with the aim of reconciling old canon with newer additions to Project Samsara.
- [ ] ---
- [ ] #### Restructuring/RES
	
	Structural rebuilds of some documents, necessary when they grow particularly long, asking for a rebuild of the headings tree, or tentative consideration of whether some documents should be merged into one or existing documents be broken down into multiple smaller ones.
- [ ] ##### RES: Vault-wide Rebuild of Text Formatting
	
	Under Miscellaneous
	(meta)
	
	A vault-wide rebuild of how text is formatted in the vault, using isolated tabs before text to show **my thoughts** and greater than indents to show **additional details or footnotes**.
- [ ] ---
- [ ] #### Admin
	
	- Deploy tagging system.
	- Take stock of the drafting note's contents


## ### Active Development Class #1

- [ ] ---
- [ ] Documents mentioned here are under maximal priority for 
	development in Samsara, and are generally being touched and built upon on a near day-to-day basis. Other than explicit documents, bits of information on certain documents are kept here as well.
- [ ] #### WCZero
	Core worldbuilding is on soft pause at the moment as we work towards the building of WCZero.


## ### Active Development Class #2

- [ ] ---
- [ ] Documents here are second in priority in the development chain, and generally these are documents that already exist, and are undergoing revisions or expansions upon their subject matter. As the case may be, they can be moved up to Priority One as space in that list is made available.
	
	- Generally, new entries here are from the [[DT.KitchenExpansion]] document.
- [ ] #### The Starwylds
	
	The doc on the Switchboard's deep space societal structure.
	Refer to [[DT.TheStarwylds]]
	@{24-06-2024}
- [ ] #### Strider Doctrine
	The nature of Striders and how they operate.
	Refer to [[DT.StriderDoctrine]]
	@{20-07-2024}
- [ ] ### Consecration
	Under [[Extended Disciplines]]
	
	A School of White ledgerial technique similar to, but weaker than the Deep Hollow. Consecration as used by chalkweavers is a ledgerial enhancement conferred via an imposition with a Skydancer. Limited in potency due to the reduced flexibility of Skydancer Impositions when compared to ones made by the Vahnkin under the Amaranth Sultan.


## ### Active Development Class #3

- [ ] ---
- [ ] Documents here bear low priority in the development chain, but may be elevated as is needed. They are likely existing docs as well, not touched upon in a while.
	
	- Generally, new entries here are from the [[DT.KitchenExpansion]] document.
- [ ] #### Project: Void 5.0
	
	Fifth time's a party.
	[[DT.Void_5.canvas]]
	
	@{25-04-2024}
- [ ] #### Perforant ACs Revision
	Revise the existing ACs to account for the addition of pierce damage. Lol.
	- [ ] [[Ven_AC]]
	- [ ] [[Hex_AC]]
	- [ ] [[Blakk_AC]]
	- [ ] [[Fyre_AC]]
	- [ ] [[Freedryck_AC]]
	- [ ] [[DT.Echo_AC]]
- [ ] #### True Damage Dissertation
	Writ on the choice of weapons when fighting in the Switchboard, based on the various forms of true damage; caedo, perf and breach.
	
	Much of the discussion surrounds how the Third Kin are uniquely resilient as a product of their immense rapid regeneration, and how strategies must be formed to account for this.
	
	Also discusses the armor problem, how perf defeats armor, but most people simply don't wear it, and so it's usage is limited.


## ### Backburner Development

- [ ] ----

## ### EX: Assets & Tools

- [ ] ---
- [ ] External assets relevant to Project Samsara, and notes on various tools I use for development.
- [ ] #### The Samsara Grid-sheet
	![[SamsaraExcel.xlsx]]
- [ ] #### 'Y-naming'
	
	The Y-naming is a means devised to facilitate the naming of concepts, entities, phenomena and the like within the Switchboard and Samsara canon, using modifications of words translated from **English** to **Yoruba** (hence the 'Y').
	
	The employment of Y-naming first of all allows for the creation of a linguistic 'baseplate' from which deviations can be made without them sounding overwhelmingly derived from English irrespective of how much scrambling and shuffling of letters is employed. There is simply very little that can be developed in even days of pondering that can sound or function as desirably as an actual language which was evolved over the course of multiple centuries.
	
	The application of Y-naming is fairly simple; run a translate to fetch the 'Y-alt' of the word, and then employ a collection of developed of rules that allows it to translate and slot in to the Samsara canon. These rules are very 'not' hard and fast, with rules developed and employed on the spot and most boiling down to what rolls off the tongue the best now, and will still sound as they are needed to days, weeks, thousands and tens of thousands of words down the line. It is the very definition of winging it, but only the truly learned and eagle eyed will ever be able to suspect what is at play, much less reverse-engineer it.
	
	The actual rules employed then, are ones of target and context; where we choose to employ Y-naming and the context of it. 
	
	We typically apply Y-naming when what needs naming is of 'cultural' origin or significance, such as a food, position in a royal court, or a phenomena first observed by a specific people. So while Y-naming may be used to name something like a waterfall, it would be strange to use it to name a piece of software. That said, this is also not a hard and fast rule - as just off the top of my head - the Breach Protocol could be called the 'Botini'; many keys, referring to it's ability to defeat all manners of doors. There is a rule about specifically 'Botini' that will be elaborated upon later.
	
	The second rule - that of context - is one that we'll see employed mostly in matters relating to the progenitor families, all of which possess decently hard rules about how names are structured. Y-alts of names are subjected to these rules to produce a result that sounds similar to other Y-alts of names relating to that family. Subjective similarity between names in this way produces visible identity and differentiation. 
	
	The third rule, described partially above the section mentioning the first two semi-hard rules, can be called the 'tongue-rule'. The Y-alts of some words simply do not sit well on the tongue, or roll off it neatly as would be liked - such as 'Botini' above. The usage of random letters to add grease to some letters and grit to others is employed, and is often just a task of bouncing syllables and sounds off the walls until something sticks.
	
	The general methodology is as such;
	1. Determine if the Y-naming is to be used
	2. If yes, fetch the Y-alt
	3. Employ the tongue-rule as needed
	4. Employ contextual rules
	5. Employ the tongue rule again if needed
	
	I could give examples, but no one is likely to see this section but me. When the Y-naming is used, it'll often be mentioned.
- [ ] #### The ''Grid'
	
	The Grid is something I employed unknowingly in The Voice in Flowers. Put most simply, it is a means of creating a large swathe of unique but related entitles by defining parameters and expanding on what forms at the intersection of these parameters.
	
	An example;
	
	|       | Weapons | Cooking Utensils |
	| ----- | ------- | ---------------- |
	| Sharp | Sword   | Knife            |
	| Blunt | Club    | Meat Tenderizer  |
	|       |         |                  |
	
	The Grid thus helps in simply defining what needs to be created, by first defining the hedge within it operates. Before we can create specificity, we must first obtain broad parameters and 'cross' them, and at the cross product of the common does the unique emerge.
- [ ] #### Milestone V1P0
	
	**Milestone V1P0** or **Samsara v1.0** (**V** **1** **P**oint **0**), is a major milestone in the Samsara project that describes a means of demarcating progress made in Samsara development - development that will begin to take place after the establishment of the **Core Samsara Sandbox**, which is what the final document stack will be called somewhat around the time we begin work on the pNarrat - in other words, after the completion of the pWB and NarratWB. 
	
	Major and minor expansions upon the Core Sandbox will be indicated by the increasing version number, meant to denote this progress and development being made. As such, it becomes simpler to describe and track iterations of Samsara as it grows even after the completion of its core foundation.
	
	This in particular helps in distribution, and the adaptation of Samsara into different forms. There is a dream of mine - a distant one yes, but such is the nature of dreams - that there is a tabletop game built upon the Samsara canon, and players issue lines such as "Oh this is built upon Samsara v1.12's mechanics." and "When will they move to SaraV2 already?"
	
	The distribution part of it excites me the most. The ability for others to set their own tales in the Samsara universe, and have these tales have as accurate to the universe's mechanics due to having those mechanics on hand is thrilling, and will foster perhaps the first of the Samsara fan works to exist.
	
	Soon.
	
	Of course, it's still quite far away. And yet it is strangely nearer than we think. All it takes is more work, harder work, better work.
