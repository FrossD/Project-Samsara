## Isalveh, The Challenger Dark
#### Excerpt
![[The Void 4#The Void as a Location: The Challenger Dark]]


### Research
Topics to study;
- Sultans and Sultanates
- Geography of islands and oceans
- Fleet and naval disambig.
- Piracy

**Sultans and Sultanates**
Wikipedia article: [Sultan - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan)

	Could probably stylize a lot of the names there with the Vahnic 'V' naming trend to get the names of the Sultans of the Amaranth.

Biomes in Isalveh and the Shelf draw from the [[Biomes of the Dancirah|biomes table]] described in SBAstro. They are naturally altered by those plane's unique global geographical modifiers; stardrip in the case of the Challenger Dark, and Glass in the case of the Vitric Shelf.
