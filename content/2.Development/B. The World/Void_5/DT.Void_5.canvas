I'll peruse the available literature on it when we come round to Void 5.\n\nThat being said, I have been playing with the idea of a physiological modification to the wielders of Void that allows for nInfo; something like a 'black box' in their lattice/straits that emerges as a result of conviction and ablation of parts of the self.
