# The Danseers
	This is the first iteration of the Danseers, the ancestor-kin of the Sil'khan and the first Chalkstriders to take a name for themselves. 

In the earliest times of the Switchboard, the early chalkstriders were without name. All the same, they were skilled Striders, very proficient with weaving chalk and tinkering with calcic constructs that dotted the astrolabic spheres. This translated into skill at exploration and later conquest of the Switchboard. From these early Striders emerged a clan of the particularly skilled at using the Strider Protocol, and they came to be known as the Skydancers - or as they are known now - the **Danseers**.

In particular, the Danseers were known for their immense power, ambition, hunger and hedonism. They possessed an immense lust for conquest, and were swift to anger and carrying out violence, prone to mismanaging their calcic powers. They spread swiftly across the Switchboard and caused chaos across sweeping expanses of it.

Their society eventually began to collapse, and there were many who sought to prevent this from happening. The Fel-Arcad chose to intervene to preserve what they felt were essential bits of the Switchboard's long and living history. Using the Sembleworks to engineer a 'fork' of the initial Danseer familial backbone, they created a new root for a new family that would come to be called the **Sil'khan**.

While the Sil'khan were definitely more docile, they gained the advantage of the Fel-Arcad's weaving prowess, and with both mastery of Striding and Weaving, their members possessed the potential to become the most powerful denizens of the Switchboard. While the possessed the Danseer's fearsome power, where they differ is in guiding credo; where the Danseers saw to conquer, the Sil'khan chose only to experience. They became more inclined towards simply seeing the expanse of the Switchboard without necessarily claiming any bit of it as 'theirs'. As a result, they became a very nomadic people, with their culture and society a derivative from the isolationism facilitated by the Strider Protocol.

> A phrase used to describe the Sil'khan is a 'family with many friends but no brothers', alluding to the fact that the Sil'khan are not tightly knit as a progenitor family.

A holdover from the time of the Danseers however, were their **Skydancers**; a group of deified characters who represented some aspect of Danseer life and the Switchboard life at large. While they are not necessarily worshipped, they do play the role of 'role models' or yardsticks by which to measure one's self, as well as a name to be called upon in adherence to the 'Doctrine of the Skydance' that spawned from their existence and lauded nature. Calling upon their names confers believers and followers of the doctrine with minuscule boons, and it is a practice still done by the Sil'khan today.
