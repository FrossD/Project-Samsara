# The Sil'khan
When the Danseers had fought and won the place of the Third Kin in the Dancirah, they could never have foreseen at the time that it would be at the cost of their own lives. Reborn from the salvaged backbone-weave of their kin, the Sil'khan boast mastery of the Strider Protocol and dominance over the Great Sky. Zealously nomadic kin of nigh-gods, their Silken Writ proclaims that the only life with any meaning is one spent cultivating strength, jaunting between stars, and building a legacy of discovery and conquest.

## Snap Thoughts
Spur of the moment thoughts that could use work.

### Uncategorized
- Something about the Silks awakening the Strider Protocol
- Something about ultimately, all suffering can be escaped from when it is awoken.

### 04. Appearance
- The **inscrit**; a body modification practice done on calcified limbs, that involves making relief carvings to depict various things of interest.

- The Silks and Danseers take halos upon their heads after extensive striding, and they came to realize that these halos had notches atop them that pointed to both the subject's place of birth and the astrolabe, thus making them effectively compasses for navigation, while also being visual signifiers of how they are exalted above the other kin.

### 14. Iconography and Architecture
#### The Bouquet-speak
A creation of the Sil'khan, the Bouquet-speak is a custom practiced by Striders as a whole as a means to communicate with each other across space using the various flowers in the Switchboard. By the usage of certain flowers and their placement in a vessel such as a vase, messages can be encoded, transmitted and deciphered. 

Of course, like language is, it is far more complex than this. The placement of flowers relative to others, the kind of vase used across the spectra of size, shape and material used, the height of the flowers, the number of them used, how the flowers are prepared before display - such as absence or presence of leaves and petals, whether multiple displays are used and the like. Utilization of these rules allows for sending complex messages that would translate to pages of text. It sees use mainly between the Striders of the Academy, as it is one of the only means of accessing the full rulebook.

Narratively, the invention of the bouquet-speak is an essential part of Sil'khan canon, an aspect to them meant to illustrate the divide between the current Sil'khan and their ancestors. It sought to create an image of refinement, poise and almost romanticism in not just the Sil'khan, but Striders as a whole.

	Of course, actually defining what every single flower meant and to hasten this addendum, the rules of the bouquet-speak would be an incredible undertaking. Narratively, certain elements will be mentioned when a scene involves debate over the meaning of a bouquet message, but the actual mechanics of it will remain - much like how it is in-universe - fairly shadowy. 

### 09. Naming and Language
#### Danseer Ancestor-Kin Names
Established idea; out of their great understanding of these things, the Fel-Arcad selected nine to twelve Danseers from which to build the Sil'khan peoples. These Danseers in true Switchboard fashion bore a name, aspect and had some lore associated with them and how they shaped the Sil'khan civilization, as when the new Sil'khan were born, the Danseers served as their parents, and educated them in their skills and doctrine.

- This particular bit is best elaborated upon in the **Ancestral Histories & Mythologies** section. 
- I also want to use this section - regarding the names - to make some calls to things I've liked over the years, though subtle, such as having a 'Danseer Karatross' as a light call to the Alchemaster.

### 10. Faith and Religion
- Skydancer doctrines upheld by their apostolics.

Three factions under the Skydancer faith in regards to Shalkarah and his relationship with Leilani
- Leilani is his sister, and thus his equal
- Leilani is his wife, and thus his better
- Leilani is his daughter, and thus his under

### 11. Factions, Philosophies and Divides
#### Nomad Classes
The Sil'khan are nomads but how so? I've had an idea of dividing them into the nomad 'purists' and the nomad... something else. We'll call them the alphas and betas.

Nomad alphas are Sil'khan who ascribe to nomadic living in a purer form, defined by living light, travelling light, and having an almost religious slant to their nomadic living. Their nomadism is worship to the Danseers almost, both their ancestor-kin and the Skydancers that fought for all Third Kin. They are preoccupied with seeing, discovering, hopping from one planet to the next, one star to the next, and their aims while on individual planets vary from group to group. Some are nomadic evangelists - spreading the word of the Nine Skydancers and serving the Third Kin through their immense proficiency with the SProt, others are nomadic conquerors, who believe that the victory won by their ancestor-kin grants them the entire Switchboard as their birthright. 

> These Sil'khan are known as the **Sabai**, a derivative from 'sabaism' referring to star worshipping. 

The Nomad betas are Sil'khan who are also nomads, but less so through the SProt, and more through command of fleets of spacefaring ships. These Sil'khan fleets amble through the Dancirah and serve as hubs for Sil'khan and others throughout the Switchboard. Often, they serve militaristic purposes, projecting immense amounts of force in stellar space. These fleets and the Sil'khan on them - though they do still hold their Danseer ancestors in high regard - busy themselves with pursuits more in the present, such as trade and commerce, personal study and development, occupations and leisurely pursuits, and exploratory outings. These Sil'khan are 'worldlier' in that regard.

### 15. Technology
#### Jaunteer Engines
> Built upon [[SB_Technology#The Jaunteer Equation|The Jaunteer Equation]].

Sil'khan technology like the **Jaunteer engine**, devices designed to emulate the Strider Protocol, and what allows the Sil's fleet of starships to operate.


### 10. Faith and Religion
#### Skydancer Profiles
The aim is to have the various Skydancer somewhat subvert the aspects they espouse, in a manner not too distant from their core doctrine. 

**Leilani**
- Immensely hedonistic
- Immensely jaded
- Office lady attire (its not a fetish)

**Zahir**
- A huge nerd
- Less so a war god, more a battle strategist
- Methodical and skilled, a war gamer

**Ryjik**
- Chef
- Bad at it

**Morrigan**
- Speaks in threes
- Voices
- Word count

**Onuris**
- Craftsman more than blacksmith

#### Skydancer Aspects
The aspects of the Skydancers, this being their various motifs and the like.
- Skydancer Pacts; their own kind of ritualism. 

#### 'The King of Roads'
Most prominent of the myths is that of the King of Roads, a figure rumored to be the first Strider. He is rumored to have the fastest Stride Velocity in all the Switchboard, allowing him to reach the farthest reaches of it near instantly. He is also rumored to have made tens of millions of sojourns across the Switchboard, and the first few Starcharts containing the first established paths are rumored to be his own creation.

His unattainable Stride Velocity has made him elusive, and though many swear to have seen trails of a Strider moving across the Switchboard at speeds that could only have been his, none have been able to catch up with him. 

His Starcharts are particularly valuable as they revealed unknown safe paths through the Switchboard, as well as secretive regions of interest to Striders. In the early Switchboard, they were an essential component of the endeavors of the first few Striders. They are highly coveted naturally, and while reproductions exist of the known ones, it is suspected thousands more exist, scattered throughout the Switchboard.

In addition to Starcharts he is believed to hoard all manners of Teks, Relics, rituals and equations and all manners of things acquired in his endless travels. Many believe that all things there ever was are known by the King, making him not just the fastest Strider, but the strongest by the virtue of Knowing.

It became commonplace then, for Striders to swear by the King, staking the truthfulness of their words on the most powerful Strider there could possibly be. Some began performing gestures akin to prayer, asking the King of Roads to grant safe passage across the Switchboard, to still the flux storms, clear the paths forward, keep instruments tuned, all to guarantee safe passage. Taken further, some gave gifts and offerings, firing objects they imagine will be valued by the King (such as Starcharts) into the depths of the Switchboard, in hope that he encounters them in their travels, and in return, keeps the skies clear.

As such, the King of Roads holds a place of cultural significance in Strider society.

#### Sacred Chalk Deserts
> [[The Dawn of the Dancirah]]

"Follow me into the desert; I promise you glory or death."

The ancestor-kin of the Sil'khan, the Old Danseers, and all other Third Kin at large arose from the surfaces of the nine astrolabic spheres that followed the Astrolabe's grand resolution which in turn followed the First Praxis War.

These astrolabic regions, however, were immensely simple due to their proportionally simple planetary equations, and as such, they were all - particularly the crowning sphere **Spyndl** - barren chalk deserts.

These harsh environs were the birthplace and incubation chambers for the earliest Third Kin, who were compelled to learn the early extents of their place, purpose and powers to survive and somewhat thrive on these barren spheres, before learning how to escape them via the Strider Protocol.

Even though widely understood as a harsh, unforgiving environment, many Danseers and the Sil'khan in turn have come to revere the chalk deserts as sacred grounds; the mother that birthed and nurtured them, and the launchpad from which they and the other Third Kin began an era of inheritance and conquest.
