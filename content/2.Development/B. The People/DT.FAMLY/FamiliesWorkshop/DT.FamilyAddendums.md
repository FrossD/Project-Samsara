**Currency** 
- Lancaster Innovations mints the cross-Dancirah currency, and it is the most widely accepted form of legal tender. The Sil'khan, Fel-Arcad and Lancasters en masse use this 'LIcoin'.
	- Fel-Arcad have arcology-specific currency that allows for strict internal regulation

**Tongues of the Switchboard**

- The Sil'khan unintentionally formed a tongue of their own, the **Starwyld Common** or **Starwyl**, that came to major use among the Switchboard's many nomads, drifters, outlaws, mercenaries, the Sil's own Sabai, malcontents and rogues. Contrasted with the NDS, it is said to be spoken sharply, crassly, and hurriedly, with many verbal timesavers and a noteworthy hand component that allows for skewing the context of a verbal statement, adding additional meaning, or weaving in a layer of subterfuge in the presence of those who aren't familiar with it.

### Fel-Arcad Addendums
- Why
	- Living boring lives for the second Refrain
	- They believe the refrain can be fought
	- Sil'khan cultivate individual strength to fight the refrain, the Fel want community strength
