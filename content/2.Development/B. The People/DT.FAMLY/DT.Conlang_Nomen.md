â€¦and nomenclatural overrides. This document is meant to serve as an index for the various in-canon names and terms for many different things, as well as serve as place for storing and explaining certain **nomenclature overrides**; discrepancies between how something is addressed in the Samsara vault, and how it would be referred to in the actual canon.

10. run

The Families
- Maybe the Sil'khan are addressed as 'Selks' when possessives are needed.

An **astrolabic day** in the Switchboard is known as an **ikt** and denotes a time measure of twenty hours. Sixteen days make up a week, known as a **cyc**, and divisions of cycs such as hacycs (eight ikts), quacycs (four ikts), ocycs (two ikts) are used for telling time.

> An alternate naming convention; weeks are 'sik' and 'siks', resulting in hasiks, quasiks, osiks and siks (for just days, as a replacement for ikts). This naming convention benefits from 'sik' possibly having a more obvious way to pronounce than 'cyc'.

The **procession calendar** is roughly broken down in two manners, the **Radiance Cycle Calendar** that divides the procession down along the seasons of calcic radiance and lull/surge periods, and the Fel-Arcad developed **Danciran Calendar** that divides the calendar into nine **month-like** subdivisions known as **haseah**. The Danciran Calendar sees plenty of use among the more corporate sectors of the Switchboard, while nomads such as the Sil'khan are more inclined to use the Radiance Cycle, as it directly informs the state of the Great Sky with regards to travel.

## The Fel-Arcad
Conlang and an index for [[The Fel-Arcad]].

### Index
1. **Arcad** - the original name for the Fel-Arcad when they had arisen and differentiated from the other Third-Kin.
2. **Arcadia** - the surrounding grounds upon which an arcology is built, defined primarily by lush conditions of plant and animal life.
 
## pNarrat: Nomenclatural Overrides
An index of the various terms used in the Samsara vault that will not carry over to any Samsara canon, replaced instead by new ones as desired.

### But Why?
For reasons ranging from flavor to dissatisfaction. A number of terms used in the Samsara vault are what they are due to being coined - often on the spot - to most simply express whatever they denoted. The Strider Protocol is for striding, the Weave Protocol for weaving, the stride-dedicom strait is for striding and computing, the interface strait for interfacing. Planetary equations are equations that govern planets. And so on, and so forth.

For one, flavor might be the major driving factor behind this. Project Samsara in its most-final iteration will feature a litany of fleshed out peoples and cultures with pseudo-tongues and words stemming from them, and ideally the words used in the canon would reflect this. While it is commonly stated that the language gap between media and reader is explained by having the writ of the media be inexplicably translated to the reader's language - as though stories depicting fictional worlds were instead translated writ from a real one - I still feel that there are words that will *not* translate to our languages as cleanly, and thus would remain in their original linguistic states.

The result of this is the necessity of constructing an index of such overridden terms and the replacement terms that override them. Where necessary, justification for certain choices will be included. And as a flavor note, terms that originate from the tongues of certain peoples in the Switchboard will have that indicated as well.
