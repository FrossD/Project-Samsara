# SBTech: Meta-analysis
The closing writ on SBTech, with the aim of realizing the technological aesthetic of the Switchboard. 

Core: [[DT.VMD.TechDesignLang]]

## Blakk's Notes
- [x] 1.	What does Medical & Pharmacological Technology look like for people made of chalk?
> SBPhysio. 

- [x] 2.	Do you think people would sell weave packs containing property weaves that you can take home and stick into something that needs it? Like, if you need a stronger front door, you wouldn't buy a stronger front door, you'd buy material strength and apply it to the door you already have. This means that small scale consumption would involve a lot of adapting and recycling, as well as much flexibility of use, as there’s very little reason why any particular object wouldn’t be able to perform any function so long as it is given the weave.

3.	This is also fairly reminiscent of some really old alchemy. Look up “phlogiston”.

4.	Moreso, the process of creating an object wouldn’t vary significantly from object to object. Any process can be used to create one object can be used to create nearly anything else of roughly equal complexity. As such, all the tradesman crafts we have would likely be condensed down to a single skillset, and so few people are likely to have jobs that specialize in creation. Anyone who does will likely be focused on very complex items, like large vehicles, buildings and databases.

- [x] 5.	“Light is an inductive weave that transmits color information. It is easily blocked by even thin boundaries, and without quantum mechanics there are no lasers to prevent it from dispersing.” Where does the light go when it is dispersed? Is it absorbed into the blocking material, or diffused into the environment?

6.	“I felt it would be simpler to have opacity and reflectivity be distinct property weaves” Technically opacity and reflectivity are the same thing, just that rough objects scatter light instead of reflecting it cleanly. So what makes a mirror a mirror is more its smoothness than anything else.

- [x] 7.	“Electrical and energy generation”. So this will need to be scrapped, as there is no electricity on the switchboard, but it does now require to be asked what is fuel on the Switchboard. Object properties converted in some way, chalk or something else?

8.	Is size an encoded property, and how do you handle things breaking into pieces?

9.	“Some of these vehicles are outfitted with engines driven by chalk rituals.” Why only some?

10.	Also, the fact that property weave is functionally unreplicatable, indestructible, light and easily stored, identified and quantified fixes your money problem. If property weave can be sent over the Anarhiza, then you have mobile money too.

11.	 I feel like misfolding is something you should expand more on. There’s no need for it to only apply to Striders.

- [x] 12.	So, what’s gravity? Is there gravity?

13.	 “Overwrite: replacement of the useful information in a Strider's lattice by junk/random chalk, often caused by lattice bombardment by high-intensity chalk sources such as a Law Star. Causes loss of information in the form of memories or weakened abilities.” If you like my light idea, that’s basically it. So Law Stars literally produce light. Convenient.

14.	 Metamaterials are going to define manufacturing, as the properties that can be granted to a material are largely arbitrary. 

15.	“Tiered Materials: Metals and Alloys” In the chemical sense of the word, the Switchboard doesn’t HAVE metals, as “metal” is an atomic property and this world doesn’t have atoms. But sure. Also I feel like you may just want a look over to this section in general, some of it feels outdated.

16.	That being said, I don’t have a lot to say about the individual materials.

17.	 “While not essential, the exposure to fresh chalk” does chalk age?

18.	 “When tritanium is in molten state and then shaped, it 'remembers' that shape when cooled within a small margin of error.” Reminds me of IRL nitinol.

19.	“Tier Five - Hexic Kacherock” Interesting…

- [x] 20.	What is hyperweave?

## Conclusion from Blakk and Hex Discussion
- No isolated property weave, move properties via chemistry and chalk ritualism.
- 'Property cubes' packed with property weave for use in rituals

- Remove spell light emission with light as a waste product and make it deliberate a part of the infamy system

### Legacy
Unsorted writ

**Upcoming Meta-analysis**
- Big data in the Switchboard; everything being ribbon means that data centers in the Switchboard can look like giant textile mills. Ribbon can be kept in solid state storage like giant spools of thread, unwound into computational technology.
	- The Switchboard does fundamentally run on what is effectively magnetic tape in our world, and as such physical storage media is very commonplace, though interspaced with some form of bulk not-digital digital mass storage.
- Very cool aesthetic of Strider technology being a mix of centralized computing reliant on botanical structure, where server rooms better resemble looms.

#### Bullets
- [V.I](https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Virtual_Intelligence) and perhaps full A.I Exist. Yet customer service, manufacture, construction, even warfare, are either done by humans or with automated systems that still require significant human oversight.

- Mobile telecommunication devices, if they exist, operate more like walkies-talkies than modern smartphones or even older cellular phones; they may have video functionality. They're also likely expensive.

- Public telecommunication and information terminals are the norm.

- Personal computers are expensive beyond the average person's ability to buy or nonexistent.

- Electronics are heavy, likely big as well, and work more effectively the larger they get.

- Physical Media is still very much major a part of society.

- If a computer network exists, it's different from, and more "primitive" than, what we have.

- Computer systems and networks (if they exist) are centralized, around supercomputers/master-control systems. Less powerful systems dial into "Central" to access functions and information that they couldn't perform or hold; [akin to the client-serve model.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model)

- Video game Arcades. Even if video game consoles exist, unlikely, they are under-powered compared to what Arcade machines can do.

- A.I, but limited automation of labor and warfare.
- Public communication and information terminals.
- Limited portable telecommunication.
- Physical Media being alive and well.
- Electronics are big, heavy, and expensive.

**Aspects 4**
> [[DT.VMDs]] that takes mainly from the anime. 

Anime to View
- Well-known
	- Akira
	- Evangelion
	- Serial Experiments Lain
	- Cowboy Bebop
	- Ghost in the Shell
	- **Gunbuster**
		- [Gunbuster (1988) VOSTFR BDrip 1080p FLAC x265-GundamGuy :: Nyaa](https://nyaa.si/view/1718406)
		- [[BB] Gunbuster [BDRip 720p] :: Nyaa](https://nyaa.si/view/448340)
		- [[EG] Aim for the Top! Gunbuster OVA BDRIP (Patched Subs, Original 2.0 + 5.1 Remix, 10Bit 1080p + 720p MKV) :: Nyaa](https://nyaa.si/view/1326624)
- Niche
	- Bubblegum Crisis
	- Venus Wars
	- Black Magic M-66
	- Armitage 3
	- Cyber City Oedo 808

## Stratagem
**Stage 1 - Fictional Writ**
Do the anime first, they're easier to get through because they are story and spectacle.

- Essential
	- Akira (*D*)
	- Serial Experiments Lain (*D*)
	- Ghost in the Shell (1995) (*D*)
- Ideal
	- Cowboy Bebop (*D*)
	- Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2001)
- Unable to Discern/Do Cursory Study
	- Bubblegum Crisis
	- Venus Wars
	- Black Magic M-66
	- Armitage 3
	- Cyber City Oedo 808

**Step 2 - Analysis & VMD Material Sourcing**
Analysis of the above. Ideally, analysis of each show is done immediately after watching, and sourcing VMD material is done on a *second* watch that takes notes of timestamps and screenshots.

**Step 3 - Non-Fictional Writ**
Arguably less essential, but the ur-examples cannot be ignored.

- Pool
	- Alien (1979)
		- [Alien movies in order: chronological and release | Space](https://www.space.com/alien-movies-in-order)
	- 2010: The Year We Make Contact (1984?)
	- Dark Star (1974)
	- Moon (2009)
	- Outland
	- Silent Running
	- The Andromeda Strain
	- Johnny Mnemonic (complaint about CGI)
	- Clockwork Orange
	- Battlestar Galactica
	- 2001 Space Odyssey
	- Rollerball
	- Elysium

**Step 4 - Analysis and VMD Material Sourcing**
Same as above.

**Step 5 - Meta-analysis**
