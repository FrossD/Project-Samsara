# The Starwylds
> [[SB_Astromechanics]] is recommended reading before this section.

The Starwylds refers to the expanse of relatively ungoverned space that exists between the various overseen cosmological domains or 'sectors' in the Dancirah. Outside of firm oversight by various bodies, the Starwylds are a veritable wild-west on stellar scale, defined the apathetic cruelty of the Switchboard and the cut-throat nature of all who seek to profit from it. The only rules are ever-shifting, easily-suspended codes of morality and honor that sees deeds both good and bad rarely go unpunished. It is also the foremost staging grounds for Samsara's narrative, as the Starwylds is more than a place, instead being the culmination of all things ontological and phenomological with reference to it. From the credo of the many who operate within it, to the rules and mechanics they are subject to, the Starwylds exists as an emergent phenomenon of every fact of Project Samsara.

## Workshop
[[SB_Astromechanics#pNarrat The Denizens in Space|The Denizens in Space]] first pitched the Starwylds as a concept into being.

#### Existing Writ
**Jumpship Combat**
While the title implies that it covers a wide range of combat engagements involving vehicles, it more specifically talks about interplanetary combat in **jumpships** performed by Strider-pilots against targets within the Great Sky.

Most commonly, Kache Krashing operations require approaching the Vault in jumpships and softening up the defense before the Krashers can be inserted and begin the process of cracking the Glasswall. The local space around Vaults are often crawling with Mind-controlled robot sentries known as 'Chromelings' that swiftly engage invading targets and aim to destroy them. They are opposed by jumpships and other 'space' craft, using all manners of mundane and calcic weaponry built into their hulls. 

interplanetary combat requires a completely different skill-set, namely that of the fighter pilot, who must treat their craft as an extension of themselves, practicing deft dodging and weaving between enemy fire, positioning, deployment of weapons, and more.

## Scope
**Starship Dynamics**
A top-level heading that tackles the various quirks of the Switchboard's starships. Much of the relevance of the Starwylds after its size comes from it being the buffer between overseen space, where various ships carrying both passengers and cargo must pass through.
- Starfleets and fleet doctrine
- Stellar Infrastructure
	- Orbital and free-stand installations
	- DevitNet infrastructure
	- Launching from planet-side to orbit
- Logistics
- Interferences and Piracy
- Smuggling

**Authorities and Administration**
The various authorities 'in charge' of the affairs of the Starwylds. While the interspaces of the Dancirah are broadly considered a lawless wasteland, many have tried to bring a semblance of order to them, out of either varying moral compulsions or the utilitarian realization that profit occasionally is maximized under such conditions.

- The Horology
- Names of Wedges and Veils

**Combat**
The topic of combat in the Starwylds. Unlike Strider Combat outlined in [[Weave and Warfare]], combat in the Starwylds is overwhelmingly vehicular and fought with much more powerful weaponry and advanced tactics at considerably larger scale. While the Strider is the smallest unit of Strider Combat, the jumpship has been acclaimed as the smallest unit of interstellar combat.
- Combatant Shapes
- Weaponry and Tactics
	- Jumpship dogfighting
	- EVA
- War Theaters
- Post-Engagement
	- Scrapping of opponents and pillaging 

**Esoterics**
Varying challenges face by those who choose to operate in the Starwylds.
- Mind Vaults
- Flux Storms and Void subject matter
- The 'Deepwylds'
