# Strider Doctrine
A document on the nature of Striders; the kin-shaped building block of the Dancirah. This document seeks to tackle the nature of their culture and tradition, with a focus on their doctrinal nomadism.


## Workshop
### Existing Writ
A document that talks about the **equipment carried by Striders** in the Switchboard.

- This idea was seeded primarily by the fact [[Chalk Ritualism]] makes use of various physical components, and as such, frequent practitioners of Chalk and any kind of ritualism really had to carry these components around.
	- This was further accentuated by the fact rituals that require property weave require carrying various property weaves around, in a universe that generally doesn't allow you to do that particularly easily.

sitive entities.

- **Property weave 'cubes'**;
	>Do you think people would sell weave packs containing property weaves that you can take home and stick into something that needs it? Like, if you need a stronger front door, you wouldn't buy a stronger front door, you'd buy material strength and apply it to the door you already have. This means that small scale consumption would involve a lot of adapting and recycling, as well as much flexibility of use, as there’s very little reason why any particular object wouldn’t be able to perform any function so long as it is given the weave.

## Scope
**Origins**
- Origins of the custom stems from when the modern definition of Strider began; with the formation of Combined Strider Operations under the Spyndl Academy to tackle the Fifth Offensive - the Mind Hunts.
- The First Striders were Danseers under the command of Skydancers Morrigan, Ryjik, Zahir and Cicere. 

**Faiths**
- The dominant religions in the Starwylds are the Skydancers and the Amaranth Sultan. While many profess passing belief in the Skydancer of Path - Cicere - and the King of Roads, Shalkarah, really only the Vahnkin profess the Amaranth Sultan, as is to be believed. 

**Technology and Gear**
- A revision to the HALOS weapon doctrine outlined in [[Martial Disciplines]]. Striders still used their hand cannons, but also use more distinct melee weapons; an executioner sword style cleaver weapon, that boasts decent heft, a singular edge and immense cutting power. The blunt edge is used for caster class weaponry perks.
	- The fact the cleaver is distinct from the longsword probably demands a different name. Perhaps they're just called cleavers.
- Something about ponchos or trench coats striders wear (flight jackets?) that are a major motif for the Striders at the time and now.
	- Name it after Shalkarah (shalkars?)
	- This is the thing that expands into a tent
- Tackleboxes or something with a different name that's used for carrying things for chalkweaving and ritualism.
	- Property weave cubes used for applying property weft to constructs.
- **Slates**

**Living and Culture**
- Research nomadic living and lifestyles.
- There's intersection here with [[DT.Conlang_Nomen]] on the 'Wylds Lingo', this being the language spoken most prominently in the Starwylds.

**Motifs**
Some ways of referring to the powers in the Switchboard;
- Weave Protocol - **Hands** - In that it facilitates the greatest of works
- Strider Protocol - **Wings** - In that it allows flight and the hallowed velocity
- Flash Protocol - **Light** - In that it enables becoming as stars

### The Star-lingo
[[DT.Conlang_Nomen]]
This is part of doc-spanning initiative of sorts to document the **various tongues spoken** in the Switchboard. Particularly however, this one deals with the tongue tentatively called the 'Starwyld Common' or **Starwyl**, which - if I were to make an immensely premature guess - would be the language most commonly spoken in much of the hypothetical spaces that a narrative could take place.

- In particular I want slangs and expletives.
- Maybe slurs too.
