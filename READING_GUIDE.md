# The Samsara Reading Guide
How to get through the canon and come out the other side unscathed.

## Logical Read Order
The most logical way to read through Project Samsara.

**Foundation - World & History** (24 595w)
An introductory section and pivotal for coming to grips with what Project Samsara and the Switchboard universe really is.

- The Switchboard (992w)
- The Astrolabe (4 922w)
- The Strider Protocol (8 424w)
- The Dawn of the Dancirah (10 257w)

**Foundation - Mechanics A** (10 906w)
A first wave of canon mechanics, focusing on the crux of the verse's mechanics; tangible information in the form of 'chalk'.

- The Hands as Chalk (6 490w)
- The Blank-Slate Mind (4 416w)

**Foundation - Mechanics B** (42 531w)
A second wave of mechanics that discusses chalk as well as some of the conventional natural sciences re-engineered for the Samsara canon.

- Calcodynamics (WIP) (16 295w)
- SB_Physiology (13 119w)
- SB_Astromechanics (10 844w)
- Glass (WIP) (2 273w)

**Narrative Worldbuilding Concepts** (34 055w)
A delving into the narrative worldbuilding, moving away from the cold and unfeeling mechanical principles to the bits of the canon that drive story and lore.

- Birthing and Being (5 213w)
- The Doctrine of Passing (6 605w)
- Switchboard Technology (WIP) (5 942w)
- Communications and Compute (WIP) (16 295w)

**The Verse** (61 455w)
A segment of further exploration into the world of Project Samsara.

- The Void (WIP) (4 372w)
- The Fel-Arcad (WIP) (49 057w)
- The Challenger Dark (WIP) (2 405w)
- The Vitric Shelf (WIP) (534w)
- The Voice in Flowers (WIP) (2 626w)
- The EPIT (WIP) (2 461w)

**Total** - **173 542w**

## Topicals
What to read to learn about certain topics.

**Combat, Power Systems, Applied Mechanics**
A favored section of myself, this section elaborates upon how chalk and the verse's mechanics are used as powers, and in combat. 

- Core
	- Weave and Warfare 
	- Chalk Ritualism
- Extra
	- Martial Disciplines
	- Extended Disciplines
	- SB_Physiology
	- Praxis Vows
- Extra 2
	- Blakk_AC
	- Fyre_AC
	- Hex_AC
	- Ven_AC

**Space and Places**
A more targeted section for exploring the places and locales of the Samsara canon.

- Core
	- SB_Astromechanics
- Extra
	- Biomes of the Dancirah
	- The Challenger Dark (WIP)
	- The Vitric Shelf (WIP)

**The Void**
A heavily work-in-progress section on Isalveh, the Challenger Dark, more commonly known as the Void.

- The Void (WIP)
- The Challenger Dark (WIP)

**Praximechanics**
A section for understanding one of the more esoteric mechanics governing the Samsara Universe; the mechanics behind knowledge and power, principles and doctrines, and the realization of convictions as actions by the means of praxis.

- The Blank-Slate Mind
- The Doctrine of Passing
- Praxis Vows
