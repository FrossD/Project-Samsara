# The Samsara Reading Guide
How to get through the canon and come out through the other side unscathed.

## Tracker
This reading guide is up to date as of **Update 'U_24do1'**, which launched on June 26th, 2024.

## Preface
At nearly half a million words, the Samsara writ is a large undertaking to build, and even more to trawl through as someone not nearly as intimate with it as the creator. As such, it is greatly advised that the whole writ not be tackled in one jaunt, but rather different topics be engaged with as desired or needed.

To facilitate this, there are two major reading guides in this document, both denoted as '**runs**'. Completing one is effectively completing a **run** of the Samsara writ. These are;
- The **General Competence Run**, a run that breaks down important documents by heading and arranges headings in a manner that allows for maximum information uptake and understanding. Slightly cumbersome to go through, but exists for instilling maximum grasp of Samsara's pivotal world mechanics in those who complete it.
- The **Topical Competence Runs**, various runs that focus on specific aspects of the Samsara canon. These are meant to be read sequentially and further elaborate on various facets of the writ.

Additionally, some documents are tagged to give more information on them, such as whether they are essential for a grasp of the run's topic, or in-development and thus less necessary for a grasp of subject matter.

- (C) - Critical for understanding the subject of the run
- (ID) - In-development, and thus can be safely ignored

## Run: General Competence
A rather long document, this is self-contained in [[RUN_GEN_COMP]]. 

## Runs: Topical Competence
Run-throughs of Samsara writ focused on various topics. These runs are loosely arranged in the order I believe they should be undertaken - factoring in a General Competence run completed beforehand - though this can also be ignored if one wants to jump to subjects that seem more interesting, or refresh their knowledge on certain topics.

### Run: Chalk - 60k words
Perhaps the single most important thing to grasp, the mechanics of chalk.

**Read Order**
- [[The Hands as Chalk]] - C - 5k
- [[Calcodynamics]] - C - 5k
- [[The Blank-Slate Mind]] - C - 4k
- [[The Doctrine of Passing]] - C - 6k
- [[The Astrolabe]] - C - 6k
- [[Chalk Ritualism]] - 10k
- [[Glass]] - 8k
- [[SB_Physiology]] - 16k

### Run: The Praximechanics - 18k words
One of the stranger bits on how Samsara works, the praximechanics are a sort of meta-mechanical ruleset that the Samsara canon operates under. Grasping them can take a few rereads, but they are arguably one of the most interesting bits of mechanical worldbuilding. I owe it all to the good doctor.

**Read Order**
- [[The Blank-Slate Mind]] - C - 4k
- [[The Doctrine of Passing]] - C - 6k
- [[The Astrolabe]] - C - 6k
- [[Praxis Impositions]] - 2k

### Run: Miscellaneous Mechanics - 65k words
A run for grasping various flavors of applied calcic mechanics, tackling technology, biology and information communications.

**Read Order**
- [[Glass]] - C - 8k
- [[SB_Technology]] - C - 21k
- [[Communications and Compute]] - C - 20k
- [[SB_Physiology]] - C - 16k

### Run: Weftcraft - 84k words
This run is focused on the subject of Samsara's world mechanics as they are applied as powers. Focusing on the application of chalk in matters of utility and combat, a solid grasp of calcodynamics is recommended before venturing into this section. 

**Read Order**
- [[The Strider Protocol]] - C - 6k
- [[Weave and Warfare]] - C - 37k
- [[Teks]] - 7k
- [[Extended Disciplines]] - 9k
- [[Martial Disciplines]] - 6k
- [[SB_Physiology]] - 16k
- [[Chalk Ritualism]] - 10k
- [[Praxis Impositions]] - 2k
- [[Esomechanists]] - ID -  1k

### Run: Arsenal Cards - 20k words
Ideally completed after a run of Weftcraft, these are example arsenal cards that illustrate the subject in practice. This run isn't particularly essential to complete.

**Read Order**
- [[Ven_AC]] - 5k
- [[Hex_AC]] - 4k
- [[Fyre_AC]] - 3k
- [[Blakk_AC]] - 5k
- [[Freedryck_AC]] - 3k

### Run: The World - 55k words
A run that is meant to convey information on the Switchboard as a world, spanning the largest stars and planets to the tiniest insects. Here, we also touch on the Void, though that is a concept under heavy development.

**Read Order**
- [[The Dawn of the Dancirah]] - 10k
- [[SB_Astromechanics]] - C - 10k
- [[The Astrolabe]] - C - 6k
- [[SB_Biota]] - C - 9k
- [[The Strider Protocol]] - C - 6k
- [[Biomes of the Dancirah]] - 7k
- [[The Void 4]] - ID - 4k
- [[The Challenger Dark]] - ID - 2k
- [[The Vitric Shelf]] - ID - 1k

### Run: Void 4 - 12k words
The Void is a subject in Samsara that deals with a locale occupying the fourth spatial dimension in the Switchboard. Existing effectively 'below' the Dancirah, it is subject to its own ruleset and mechanics, which have been the source of extensive contention and thus reconstruction. This is currently the fourth revision of the Void, with the fifth - colloquially called 'Void 5' - being in development. As such, what exists in this run is subject to later revision, but most of the broad ideas about the Void are set in stone, making this run still worth pursuing.

**Read Order**
- [[The Void 4]] - C/ID - 4k
- [[Blackjack]] - ID - 2k
- [[Latest Void Revisions]] - C/ID - 4k
- [[The Challenger Dark]] - C/ID - 2k

### Run: The Great Families - 144k words
A run that teaches on the Switchboard's great families. As of now, really only the Fel-Arcad have been committed to writ, but they are still categorically the longest subject to pursue by sheer word count.

**Read Order**
- [[The Dawn of the Dancirah]] - C - 10k
- [[The Doctrine of Passing]] - 6k
- [[SB_Physiology]] - 16k
- [[Birthing and Being]] - 7k
- [[The Fel-Arcad]] - C - 77k
- [[Family Addendums]] - C - 28k

> There is also a final document here titled '**The Subjects of Red**' (9k words), which deals with topics not for polite company, as it were. Access to it can be granted on special request, though granting such is at my discretion.
