# Strider Descendance
The alpha of a document that will eventually expand to cover most of Strider's relationships and the building blocks of [[The Doctrine of Passing]]. This first iteration begins with procreative methods, with an emphasis on the chalk-derivative method of the Ritual of Conjugation.

**Post-Hex Discussion**
- Not personally morally responsible for what characters due with the Ritual of Conjoining, but rather only responsible if I do not condemns this somewhat, to an extent.
- Biology is complicated enough that narratively, there's plenty of room for the shadowy-cloud of 'It just works like that!'.
- A prong of eugenics is classification of traits into positive and negative. Some are easily determined to be negative (like sickle cell), while some are *considered* to be negative (such as being queer) due to...
- The social rules that exist. The point of 'securing a most viable future for a descendant by giving them the Strider Protocol' stems entirely from the societal deification of Striders. 
- Narratively, the argument made against eugenics and genetic modification (for maybe superficial reasons) has to be the insistence on life being completely livable - or even better lived - without the Strider Protocol. This links well into developing a 'Philosophy of the Grounded'; what is it like for non-Striders in the Switchboard?

## Methods
Two methods exist for Striders to produce descendants; the regular method of intercourse and chalk-derivative method known as the '**Ritual of Conjugation**'.

The regular method of course works as you'd expect, though the mechanics of genetics are altered somewhat to comply with Information Tangibility. An essential quality of the regular method is that it is the only means of Striders to have offspring with Grounded, without undergoing some esoteric processes to obtain a component needed for the Conjugation, described below.

The Ritual of Conjugation works by Striders taking a ribbon out of themselves that contains a somewhat-random measure of their ontological information, and 'knitting' it with another Strider's to induce a rapid information accumulation and folding process that results in descendants. It's a decidedly more clinical method of doing things, but with added advantages due to the mechanics of Information Tangibility.

Of particular note is that the Ritual of Conjugation allows 'bypass' of conventional genetics, removing most of the conventional limits of biology. Predominantly, these are the requirement of two opposing sexes, or the constraint of only two party's genetic material being possible to use. Theoretically, any number or permutation or number of consenting Striders could perform the Conjugation and have descendants, with the intricacies of chalk and the cosmic dice deciding the rest.

The rapidly growing chalk conjugate requires no conscious sustenance other than a sufficient amount of latent chalk in the vicinity. It devours the chalk of it's environs and the nature of the chalk it consumes alters the qualities of the emergent offspring. 

## Further Notes on the Ritual of Conjugation
### Latent Chalk
The offspring conjugate feeds on the chalk in its environs and folds it to form its bodily matter. The baseline information to work with is provided through the donor chalk of the ancestors, enabling the descendant to inherit qualities from both. Beyond this however, a fraction of the offspring's nature is shaped by the latent chalk in its immediate environs. 

The hungry pull of a developing conjugate can unravel the folded chalk around it into ribbon form, pulling it into itself, and becoming additional components or 'wild cards' in its developments. As such, descendants may be born with knowledge or affinity towards certain things, additional powers and more. Generally, the environment shapes the descendant, allowing the Switchboard near and far to imprint upon them, further altering their nature from just the offspring of their ancestors. 

### Controlled External Influence
The result of conjugation occurring at the ribbon level means it's possible for deliberately added external factors to interfere with the development process, creating a chalk analogue of genetic engineering. A Strider obsessed with ensuring their descendants inherit their nature or most powerful qualities may seek to alter the 'conjugal ribbon' they donate, ensuring it contains the desired characteristics. Alternatively, they may aim to alter the final result but 'feeding' the developing conjugate with chosen folded chalk. 

Of course, there is also the possibility of a chalk analogue of eugenics, where Striders may aim to curb the descent of certain qualities into future generations. While it prompts discussion into the many prongs of eugenics - most particularly discussion of what are positive and negative traits - it is absolutely the case that less-than-savory Striders would use it to tailor bloodlines to their own prejudices. 

The question that needs asking is a narrative one; should Striders even be capable of interfering on a whim with the conjugation process? My answer is yes, as it gives me more tools as the creator of the narrative. That said, as with anything I can implement rules that alter the perception of such actions and the contexts they take place in.

For example, the sheer amount and complexity of a Strider's information means finding and extracting a desirable trait to be spliced into a conjugal ribbon is much like trying to find a specific sentence in a book when you don't know what page of the book it's in, the name of the book, what section it's in, what section *that* section is a *sub*-section of, whether you're even at the right library etc. Effectively, deciding the traits passed on in the conjugal ribbon is tedious enough to dissuade most, while also serving the narrative purpose of showing the sick, twisted devotion of those who do so anyway. As with all good swords, it cuts on both sides, and the second swipe is no less deadly. 

How about a developing conjugate? Can it not be altered during the growing process since it feeds on chalk in it's vicinity? Somewhat, but aiming to do any kind of precise work on a developing conjugate is much like trying to return a book to a specific shelf in a library while the library is being tossed about in the clutches of a hurricane. A developing conjugate is a storm of chalk being drawn in, sorted accordingly to effectively arbitrary criteria, folded, unfolded and refolded before being slotted into place in a lattice of incalculable complexity. Modifying the conjugate during it's growing process is nearly a surefire way to collapse it, or create something horrendously warped.

### Gifts for the Descended
Descendants stand to inherit a fair bit from their ancestors due to the nature of the Ritual of Conjugation and Information Tangibility, as well as more to obtain from the latent chalk of the growing environs. The result is descended Striders arise with a fair bit of knowledge of their world already, as well as powers possessed by their ancestors.

A result of this is ancestral Teks; Teks that pass through generations of Strider families, waxing and waning in power, changing in subtle or drastic ways. They serve to reinforce familial identities or unity among Strider factions. Additionally, much like regions are tied in their equations to their parent Wellsprings, Striders imbibe the latent chalk of their region, the result being the very essence of 'home' being imprinted upon them. This sense serves a useful purpose, empowering Striders when they fight or Stride from their home region, as well as a serving as an internal compass back to it.

Its possible for Striders to imbibe '**regional Teks**', minor Teks that manifest from the collective information of an entire region, formed from it's physical structure, it's inhabitants and its history. Typically they are weaker than conventional Teks, but serve as a further way of expressing the relationship between Striders from common regions.

### Descendance of the SProt
The Strider Protocol is genetic and is subject to the same rules applying to hereditary qualities. The propensity for a given descendant to have the SProt is dependent on their immediate parents and their line of ancestry. If both (or more) parents are Striders, odds are good that their descendant will also be a Strider. Less so if one or more parents are Grounded, or if a Strider parent had parents of their own that were Grounded. The result is skewed if the descendant arises via the Ritual of Conjugation, which favors descendants having the Strider Protocol.

'Dilution' of the Strider Protocol in offspring as a result of non-Strider parents produces most of the differences in the proficiencies of individual Striders at Striding as well as general proficiency with chalk. Some Striders are simply built different. That said, practice and skill goes a considerable distance under Chalk.
