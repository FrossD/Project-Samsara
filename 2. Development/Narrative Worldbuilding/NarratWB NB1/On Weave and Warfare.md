# On Weave and Warfare
A doc that addresses the most well-understood language to all that lives and breathes; violence.

## Strider Combat
In addition to how Striders move, is how Striders fight. Here, we look over the mechanics of Strider Combat. Strider Combat relies heavily on the concept of Chalk Ribbons and the Weave Protocol discussed in [[The Hands as Chalk]]. 

### The Theory of Damage
The theory of damage is a study of how damage is dealt and taken in the Switchboard. It begins with an essential bit of information on chalk interactions;

![[The Hands as Chalk#^c91b12]]

Chalk interactions happen primarily at the ribbon level, and this is true of combat interactions between Striders. The physical form of a Strider is a series of chalk ribbons arranged into patterns possessing immense intricacy and complexity. The integrity of this pattern subsequently determines the integrity of the Strider that makes them up. Striders are 'lattices' of Chalk that function optimally when fully intact.

As a Strider's lattice sustains damage, it disrupts the behavior of chalk within them, affecting their ability to use chalk-dependent abilities; weaving chalk, casting rituals, using Teks and Relics, and the Strider Protocol. A Strider's lattice passively repairs itself as the Strider accumulates chalk via Information Affinity. Regeneration of the lattice can be accelerated by focusing on the task, but this leaves the Strider unable to utilize other abilities. 

All damage dealt to Striders then, is a product of interference with the lattice. Exposure to a Law Star for example, assaults the lattice of a Strider with barrages of immensely dense chalk; disorganized information, knocking bits and pieces of the lattice out of arrangement. Much like sandblasting a painted wall, stripping bits of paint off. All hazards that affect Striders ultimately do so by attacking the lattice. This is the theory of damage. ^d2b154

Strider Combat as a result, is the aim to sufficiently damage a Strider's lattice, rendering them unable to fight, or killing them outrightly.

### Anti-Lattice Warfare
To deduce what can damage a lattice, we simply need to ask ourselves if the object in question is capable of disrupting orderly systems; introducing chaos where there is order. As such, most of what can damage/harm flesh can do so for lattices. 

Getting into the physical, piercing and cutting attacks are very effective against a lattice, doing immense targeted damage at a point in the case of piercing, and inflicting disruption across multiple systems in the case of cutting. Bludgeoning attacks are more suitable for 'rattling', temporary disruption in abilities that open up a target for further punishment, though truly powerful crushing blows can shatter functions in singular hits. ^55a30c

Biological and chemical attacks such as diseases and poisons are effective on lattices as well, as they can be seen as 'rogue' equations. They fold the ribbons of the lattice into differing configurations that damages the overall integrity of the system. In the case of diseases for example, they fold the Strider's lattice into more of the disease, wreaking havoc as it passes through the body. ^86f483

Phenomena attacks such as extreme heat and cold, vibration (shockwaves) etc. also constitute a threat to a lattice. They introduce unwanted information into equations, and cause the resulting folded Chalk to be distorted.

Lattice 'thickness' varies in distribution across a Strider's body, and striking the typical regions you expect to induce the most harm still does. Though Striders lack a centralized thinking center, and run on chalk rather circulatory blood, striking the head and chest of a Strider is still an effective means to do damage. Striking joints disables the limbs that hinge on them. In addition to this however, particularly well-aimed attacks can disable a Tek or hamper a Strider's ability to Stride.

### The Flash Protocol
![[The Strider Protocol#^bf3cf6]]

> "And so did the First Dancers of the Great Sky grasp that for a brief moment, they too could shine like the life-giving Law Stars, and within those windows of cosmic divinity, they could take hold of the Current, and wrench from it a tomorrow skewed to their ideals."

The blessing that is the Flash Protocol, conferred upon Striders allows them to surpass limits, to cheat - as it were - in their chalkweaving. By using the power of the stride equation, they are able ramrod complex patterns through the computation required to realize them as weave, and through expending massive amounts of chalk, they are able to shine as bright as stars, and execute a dimension of chalkweaving that escapes even the strongest, the most skilled, weavers.

Primarily, the Flash Protocol is used in combat; few other scenarios demand so cataclysmic a display of power. The nuances of this usage are seen in three major forms, depending on the pattern of the Flash the Strider means to execute;

- **Physical Overclock**; a massive augment to the Strider's base physical abilities, allowing them to vastly exceed the constraints of the body as well as massively augment the power of their physical weapons. In addition to merely buffing speed and strength, it augments finer skills such as dexterity and nimbleness, and other qualities such as eyesight, granting a boost to Striders using ranged weapons. This ability, simply put, overclocks the lattice of the caster.

- **Weave Overclock**; a massive augment to the Strider's weaving abilities. It grants the power to supercharge a Strider's 'Weave Powers', increasing the potency of their highest-uptime, most versatile calcic abilities. This ability functions by overclocking the Weave Protocol.

- **Flashcharge**; outputs a massive amount of power to a singular component of the Strider's arsenal, to make a singular, decisive cast. Allows for massively enhancing the effectiveness of a Tek, relic, a combat ritual, titular power, or artifact power. Most high-level Striders choose to use their flashcharge - '**using their flash**' - as the sheer power of their Teks and relics enhanced multiple fold does far more damage than merely augmenting their physical or base weaving abilities. Particularly skilled Striders can supercharge multiple components of their arsenal, such as multiple relics, multiple Teks, or a Tek and a relic. 

The Physical and Weave Overclocks can be used as both a **burst flash** and a **sustained flash**. Burst flashes grant the entire power boost spread over very short time, allowing only a few seconds of decisive action. The sustained flash grants the '**flash state**', and serves as a passive but long term boost to the Strider's abilities. The flashcharge can only be burst flashed. 

One common usage of the Ribbon Overclock in particular is **Flash-Woven Armament**, the ability to cast the Flash Protocol and expend it in weaving immensely complex, proportionally powerful woven weaponry that can be used for a handful of devastating attacks before resolving back into chalk.

**Terms**
- Burst Physical Overclock: **Flash Strike**
- Sustained Physical Overclock: **Lattice Overclock**
- Burst Weave Overclock: **Flash Weave**
- Sustained Weave Overclock: **Ribbon Overclock**
- **Flashcharging**

> **Further notes on inspiration**;
> The Flash Protocol, going full mask-off, is effectively a super ability. An ultimate move, z-move, final smash, whatever you want to call it. Primarily it is inspired by Destiny 2's super abilities, of which there are primarily two types; burst supers and 'roaming' supers.
> 
> Burst supers function by burning your 'supercharge' in one fell swoop. You cast the ability and it resolves, such as throwing a black hole (Nova Bomb) or a freezing tornado (Silence & Squall). Roaming supers place the caster in a 'state' in which they obtain a 'super shield' (functionally an increase to damage resistance) and empower their attacks often by summoning a weapon (Arcstaff summons a quarterstaff made of lightning, Daybreak summons a flaming sword, Sentinel Shield summons an enemy-devouring shield etc.)
> 
> How this transitions to Samsara is that roaming supers take the form of **Lattice Overclock** and **Ribbon Overclock** abilities. In this, a Strider expends their flashcharge on a sustained cast, which by design, summons something that persists for an amount of time that the caster is able to use. A ribbon overclock could be summoning a powerful weapon to make devastating attacks, while a lattice overclock, which empowers physical abilities, would see exponential boosts to those.
> 
> **Flash Strikes** and **Flash Weaves** are the burst super equivalents. All the power of the flashcharge is expended in a single strike or a very brief moment. Flash Weave often involves spinning a weapon from ribbon that is immensely powerful, but only persists for a single, or a couple of actions. Similar for a Flash Strike. That isn't to say that the **effects** of these casts do not linger in the environment for an amount of time.
> 
> **Flashcharging** a part of the arsenal is a fairly more original idea. The power of the flashcharge is expended in a weapon, power, rituals etc. 

There is a fair amount of debate among field Striders on what is the most effective way to expend a flashcharge once one is ready. Most of the discourse results from the fact most field Striders cultivate fighting styles that naturally include how they use the flashcharge, and so are naturally inclined towards declaring their methods as superior. The more nuanced take however, is that it is fairly dependent on target and caster.

For one, many feel that the Lattice Overclock and Flash Strike are the weakest means of utilizing the flashcharge. Unless you are fighting [[The EPIT#The Shattered|Shattered]], in which case calcic alternatives and abilities would be useless. The Lattice Overlock as well does present the problem of a target having to engage with an opponent that is moving faster, hitting harder, and taking more hits... at absolute minimum. So long as it is a physical ability, the Lattice Overclock can rapidly enhance it, meaning a caster of it could improve hand-eye coordination to enhance firearm accuracy, or reflexes to dodge fast-moving projectiles. 

That all being said, the sheer versatility and power output of calcic powers ensures that they remain steadily on top, and all Striders of some repute make it a point to have some means of expending their flashcharge towards calcic ends. Striders able to constantly maintain a 'low power' version of the Flash State typically do so in Ribbon Overclock 'mode', and have all their calcic abilities (weave powers et al.) empowered while partnered with new ones.

Expending the Flash Protocol to 'flashcharge' a component of the Strider's arsenal, however, is preferred and practiced by veteran Striders with fighting styles honed over dozens of processions and hundred of sojourns. It comes down to a simple logic, that a fighting style should have a singular or couple of ways to achieve a 'win condition', and that the flashcharge should be used to expedite the process of getting to it. Likewise with Striders who wield relic weapons; a weapon powerful enough to fell most things is usually only a flashcharge away from felling *all* things. 

Such is the way Strider veterans utilize the flashcharge; utilize abilities that create vulnerabilities - these are the win conditions - then exploit the vulnerabilities maximally to reap maximum rewards.

## Depthstrider Combat
The primary core of Depthstrider combat is similar to the mechanics of the Depthstride; inducing localized instances of curvature and anti-curvature. Inducing these instances at points causes information - and by extension, things in general - to be drawn or repelled from that point. Put most simply, the first aspect of Depthstrider combat is effectively gravity manipulation. Discussion on how this will be creatively used in combat is done later. 

The secondary core is the Void's power to 'pull' information as means to cause damage. It is the inverse of Law Stars method of causing damage by constantly outputting intense waves of Chalk. Law Stars would take your shirt off by blowing on you until it flies off your back, while the Void would grab your collar and rip it off you from the front. It behaves similarly towards Lattices, aiming to undo them by pulling on the weakest threads so the rest comes apart.

Because of this, the second aspect of Depthstrider Combat is **disruption**; aiming to interfere all Chalk-reliant systems. The apparent pull of the Void induces pressure on Chalk, weakening it, producing inaccuracy and inconsistency, which can be exploited by the rest of a Depthstrider's arsenal. Typically, undoing a Chalk ritual using Chalk requires complex and delicate manipulation; doing so with Void is holding candle flame to paper.

Particularly proficient use of this pull can allow Depthstriders to steal secrets and information from their opponents, and due to Information Tangibility principles, it results in the weakening of the one taken from, and increased strength for the Depthstrider. Protracted matches favor Depthstriders, who continuously adapt in their fight against an opponent, as more and more of their nature is Learned by the Depthstrider. 

### Tools and Weapons from the Void
An idea worth exploring is the Void counterpart of Chalk Relics, that being weapons granted their power by exposure to, or imbibing them with, Void.

Acquisition of a Void weapon uses Giving, Taking, or - exclusive to the most powerful of Void Wielders, the Drifters - Shaping. Being Given a Void weapon is how most Depthstriders acquire a weapon with which to combine with their void powers. However, what is Given is lacking in power and specificity; you are forced to settle with what you acquire. Taking a void weapon is far more ideal, as it carries more of your intent with it. Shaping a weapon from the Void creates the most powerful implements, as it is made of pure will, desire and intent. 

Additionally, a fourth method exists, similar to the [[On Weave and Warfare#The Artificial Relics|making of artificial relics]] - that being Forging. A mundane/conventional weapon can be allowed to marinate in the Void and gain some inclination towards the Void and it's nature. The strength of these weapons vary, but they are never more powerful than a void weapon acquired by shaping.

The advantage presented by void weaponry are their increased proficiency in anti-lattice combat methods, and how they interact with induced localized curvature and anti-curvature, described more in detail in the next section that theory-crafts the practical elements of Depthstrider combat.

### Theorizing Depthstrider Combat Methods
#### The Foundational
The core of Depthstrider combat being gravity manipulation presents a selection of abilities that appear constrained at first, but with creativity, can demonstrate considerable variation and power.

**Point attraction** and **point repulsion** are the basics, and functionally give a Depthstrider spatial control of a battlefield. Offensively, placing attraction and repulsion points allows forcefully moving combatants and objects in any direction the void-wielder chooses. Defensively, projectiles can be deflected off-course by interfering gravitational fields, or locked in place by the resultant of counteracting gravitational forces. 

It presents brute force methods of engagement. An opponent can be flattened under immense repulsive force acting above them, or flung repeatedly into objects or have objects flung repeatedly into them. 

As a utility power, gravity manipulation can allow for flight and moving large objects, as well as dexterous movement at high speeds (think gravity slingshot maneuvers but for someone running on the ground). Fine application of gravitational force - such as extremely minute, immensely weak forces of attraction and repulsion - can be used for far more delicate work, such as moving cylinders to pick a lock, or opposing forces producing spin, allowing removal of screws in watches, as an example.

Currently, gravity manipulation works as a very ranged power, allowing exerting considerable lethality from afar. Close range applications exist as well, when it is considered that a brief moment - a 'pulse' - of immense attraction or repulsion, can rapidly accelerate anything in the vicinity, allowing adding more force to certain actions.

A bladed weapon could have a point of immense attraction tethered to it's cutting edge, effectively pulling it along as the user moves for a swing, manufacturing additional force behind each attack. Similarly, a blunt weapon such as a hammer can be propelled from rest to immense velocity by 'pulsing' a repulsive force behind it, amplifying it's destructive power. Projectiles - both thrown and propelled - can be accelerated similarly.

#### The Esoteric
Delving into the speculative, in what ways can the gravity powers of Depthstriders be used?

The first example is 'paired' points of attraction and repulsion; instead of indiscriminately attracting or repelling everything in the vicinity, pairs or sets of points can only act on each other, similar to two-way radios. Additionally, an attraction or repulsion point could be modified to only attract or repel designated objects. A Depthstrider could tether an attraction point to an opponent, and fling projectiles attuned to that point, causing them to 'home in' on the target. 

Also to consider is that with enough gravity, light itself can be dragged towards a point and consumed. An intense point of gravitational attraction could produce a region of impenetrable shadow, while one of immense repulsion would be awash with blinding light. Pulsing the latter could serve as a 'gravity flashbang', the brightness disorienting targets. 


## Strider Vs. Non-Strider Combat
![[Glass#Anti-Strider Warfare]]

Elaborating on this, Glass serves an equalizer between Chalkweavers and Grounded in combat encounters. The caedometricity of glass allows for almost outrightly defeating any and all calcic measures. Weave comes undone, rituals collapse, even the resultant of a cast (such as phenomena-based attacks) can be defeated by glass. And with the lethality of glass against Striders and Weavers, a fairly skilled Grounded is very capable of defeating a Strider should they find themselves caught in the midst of a particularly fatal miscalculation.

That being said, the Grounded still lack a litany of advantages granted to Striders, such as physical enhancements granted by the Flash Protocol, relics that are able to maintain their effectiveness even with glass in the vicinity (such as firearms), and attacks that can't necessarily be blocked due to not being calcic in nature (such as explosions). While glass does allow for 'one-shotting' a Strider, a Strider can get away with far more mistakes and still possesses a non-trivial amount of options up their sleeves.

## The Super-Classes
Previous sections and other docs have worked to establish the various power systems that denizens of the Switchboard use for utility and combat purposes. The distinctions between individual wieldable systems and powers allows for categorization of their wielders into various **super-classes**; neatly defined boxes of powers and qualities, which allow us to understand what a subject who bears the title the boxes describe is capable of.

There are thus **four** super-classes;
- Chalkweavers
- Depthstrider
- Pale Amaran
- Esomechanist

### Chalkweavers
Exhaustively defined elsewhere (such as [[The Hands as Chalk]] and [[The Strider Protocol]]), Chalkweavers in the context of Switchboard Combat are those who wield the Weave Protocol to manipulate chalk. Chalk*striders* also fall under this category.

Wielding chalk under the Switchboard's combat systems entails a number of things; weaving chalk to use the core five weaving powers of Strike, Charge, Shield, Dash and Armament. Additionally is the usage of Teks and Rituals, including both Quis and full rituals. Particularly skilled Weavers can also cast Grand Rituals using their Flash Protocol, but only Chalk*striders* can use the Flash Protocol's additional powers of Physical and Weave Overclocks and the Flashcharge. 

#### Arsenal
**T1 - Relic Armaments**
Chalkweaver arsenals begin with their relic weapons; weapons inculcated with rituals and chalk to see their functionality enhanced beyond the mundane qualities of their construction. Chalkweavers and Striders especially have a primary weapon that serves as their 'signature'; a weapon they are most proficient with and thus are most recognizable by. While Chalkweavers may not necessarily wield a relic weapon, the full potential of their arsenal demands one.

- **Relic Martial Arm**  
	A melee relic. Chalkweavers tend to favor weapons on higher or middling on the edge spectrum and middling or lower on the weight spectrum, thus opting for swords of various classes and daggers, with more skilled wielders taking glaives. The **praxlance** is an uncommon, high level weapon used by the most skilled of Weavers.
	
- **Relic Firearm**  
	A ranged relic, often a firearm of sorts. Long range engagement of targets is valuable in most circumstances, and ranged relics see plenty of use among Weavers. Chalk serves to enhance their various qualities - range and destructiveness - and mitigate their drawbacks, such as accuracy and recoil. 

Weavers overwhelmingly prefer **caster** class weapons, as they greatly aid a Weaver in their casting of weave powers. 

T2 - **Elementary Calcic**
In which we get to the first of the subject's calcic abilities (if present). These abilities are the most elementary, but their versatility aids in their ability in creating a distinct combat identity for a subject. The elementary calcic are the weave abilities, granted differentiation through usage and interwoven equations within their executions.

- **Weave Strike**
	The most elementary of Chalkweaver powers. Defined by low complexity, high uptime, varying damage and plenty of avenues for additional versatility and power, every Weaver's weave strike is an ability that serves as the baseline for their weaving powers. As regards the forms it takes, the most elementary forms it takes is chalk ribbon wound around a body part, used to enhance the effectiveness of a physical strike or add additional quirks or properties to it. More advanced weave strikes are hurled abilities such as woven projectiles. 
	
	- What is most important about a weave strike ultimately, is the ability to deploy it in the space of a finger snap. Even with additional properties appended to it via the addition of equations or the utilization of other powers a Weaver may possess, the success of the weave strike lies in its ability to be used quickly, frequently, as effectively as possible, and with minimal drawbacks in the form of induced **unravelling**. 
	
	- Because the weave strike is often a Weaver's most frequently used ability short of their weaponry, Weavers are often identified and known for the ability they use, contributing to their repute.
	
- **Woven Charge**
	A more complex calcic ability, defined by needing more 'preparation' for its casting. The woven charge evolves in complexity from the weave strike, this upscaled complexity allowing for more damage, additional quirks in its casting, additional properties in its resolution, and ultimately more utility spawned from additional versatility. 
	
	- Preparing a charge is done by weaving ribbon into the pattern of what is desired to cast, equations being woven in as well to grant the additional casting and resolution parameters.
	
	- The most common forms it takes are '**blast**', '**grenade**' and '**imbue**' configurations. **Blasts** emanate usually from the hands, and resolve as the effects of the charge in an area in front of the caster, such as a cone shape. **Grenades** become projectiles, and can be thrown to resolve their effects over an area. Grenades are also able to be woven with casting parameters, such as being able to be stuck to a wall and only resolve (detonate) when a potential target comes near. **Imbues** are usually effects that are cast over the self or a target, and instead of being fired or tossed outwards, they are prepared and resolved within the same context. They often provide effects to the caster of the imbue.
	
- **Knit-Shield**
	The logic of the knit-shield is how weave interacts and interferes with other weave, the optimization of destructive interactions manifesting as the design of **counterweave**. Imagining the knit-shield as similar to actual knitting - a weave of large, thick fibers - and then envisioning what it's like to try to punch through, slash or rip said knitting gives a fairly elementary, but functional understanding of how the knit-shield functions. 
	
	- The knit-shield serves as a defensive measure, protecting the caster by creating a secondary lattice to protect the primary, main lattice of their bodies. knit-shields also vary in forms, with some being shields that a caster deploys in front of them - such as from the hands - in anticipation of attack, or function as second skin covering their entire frame, passively protecting from attack. These are **active** and **passive** shielding techniques.
	
	- Additional properties are added to shields through equations, allowing for inducing weave more resilient to certain forms of attack, or regenerating faster, or doing certain thins when struck. Often, a Weaver's knit-shield also serves as a weapon, punishing attacks for as long as it stays up. Utility features can be woven into it as well, such as repulsion to elements.
	
	- Breaking the knit-shield is usually a prerequisite to doing any real damage to a Weaver.
	
- **Weft Dash**
	Serving as a secondary defensive ability, the weft dash is a mobility technique employed by Weavers using their command of chalk. The Strider Protocol at its core allows for weaving chalk into pure velocity with marvelous efficiency. The weft dash works off of that in its most elementary forms, allowing Weavers to flare chalk - even if momentarily - to gain a powerful momentum boost, allowing them to dodge an oncoming attack or reposition to a more favorable position.
	
	- While called 'dash', it isn't limited to conventional understanding of that word; it instead covers a wide variety of movement techniques devised by Weavers, often the only commonality shared between them being the employment of calcic methods, and the ends of instantaneous movement being realized.
	
- **Woven Armament**
	One of the more complex ways to use weave, a layer of ribbon can be would around a mundane weapon, enhancing it with calcic powers in a move that allows for it to function as a proto relic. Weaving equations into a layer of weave and wrapping a weapon with it grants it additional powers and utility; weapons can become lighter to wield, but strike harder and cut deeper when swung or impart effects on hit, firearms can become more accurate and impart less recoil on firing, and more.
	
	- Taken to another step though, it is possible to weave weapons **entirely** out of chalk and fight with them as one would normally. While particularly skilled Weavers can do so and have the weapons persist for long periods of times, more often than not a woven weapon is used much the same way as an ability is; casted and resolved fairly quickly, imparting its effects. Woven armaments are thus often used in a sequence of attacks; woven into much larger combos, or deployed only when the specific, unique function they serve is needed.

T3 - **Advanced Calcic**
Into the advanced calcic do we see Teks and chalk rituals make an appearance. Despite the fact that Teks do not particularly require all that much skill to simply use, obtaining them is a sign of a fairly skilled subject. The fact that any two Teks being even remotely similar is an extreme rarity means that Teks are a massive contributor to a subject's recognizability, so much so that Teks can be the basis for forming somewhat [[The Blank-Slate Mind#Teks and Striders|cult-like followings]]. Rituals make an appearance here in the form of Quis or quickcasts, which are learnable and executable by virtually anyone half decent at weaving chalk. Often, Quis only contribute to a subject's notoriety if they were the first person to utilize them (i.e., the drafter of the schema).

- **Teks** 
	Truly stretching the limits of what chalk is capable of, Teks are inconceivably complex calcic equations that fold chalk to perform incredible feats. Whereas weaving the chalk necessary to simulate the effects of a Tek would be wholly undoable by even the most skilled Weavers, Teks emerge from the nearly unknowable mechanics of the Astrolabe, and manifest as abilities Weavers can cast without having to weave themselves, or even understand how they work.

- **Quis**  
	Quis or quickcast rituals make their appearance in a Weaver's arsenal here. Using a qui-wheel, Weavers are able to quickly deploy even powerful and complex rituals on the battlefield to considerable effect, and it is widely argued that quis are the most dangerous part of engaging with Weavers.

T4 - **Grand Calcic**
The arsenal of Chalkweavers end here, but the power of grand ritual is nothing to scoff at. Expending components, chalk and time allows the strongest Weavers to cast complex rituals, performing feats in the Switchboard of immense power. The sheer versatility of the calcic ritualism comes down to the diversity of ritual schema that exists, and a Weaver giving their all can enhance even mundane, simple rituals to lofty heights.

- **Grand Ritualism** 
	Rituals boast incredible power, and Weavers can expend immense amounts of accumulated chalk to cast grand rituals. While they often require being stationary and take time to deploy, they come close to rivalling the power of the Flash Protocol, and often overtake it in versatility, as Striders usually only have a few ways they use the Flash. Grand rituals are cast with schema, and a Weaver who knows hundreds - thousands even - of rituals will prove to be an immensely formidable fighter.

T5 - **The Flash Protocol**
The domain of the highest calcic ability; true power is found here in the shape of the Flash Protocol, able to unlock the ultimate potential of previous weapons and abilities in the arsenal. Striders are known often by their Flash - the moment when they shine as bright as stars. The Flash is the ability they use to rescue losing situations, secure an edge over an equally matched opponent, or add flair to a victory already secured. Even when faced with darkest, mightiest terrors of the Switchboard, the Flash is able to shine through, piercing all with its unrivalled light.

- **Flash Protocol**
	Only able to be casted by Striders, the Flash Protocol stands at the pinnacle of a chalk arsenal. Overclocks and expending the Flashcharge on other parts of the arsenal have the ability to end fights before they begin, or wrench victory from the jaws of defeat. Striders are often known for the weakest *and* the strongest parts of their arsenal, and no ability builds more repute than a Strider's Flash.

### Depthstriders
Defined more thoroughly in [[The Void]], Depthstriders utilize their powers born from the Amaranth in combat. This manifests as the Void powers of Giving, Taking, wielding amara-forged weaponry from Forging and Curvature Manipulation. Stronger Depthstriders - the Void Drifters - are able to use Shaping, as well as manipulate localized time using their power over the Dynamic Coupling Constant.

Depthstrider powers work fairly differently from Chalkweaver ones; their dependency on Giving and Taking sees that their fighting makes greater use of **physical implements** gifted or taken from the Void, rather than phenomena-based abilities woven from chalk. The result of this is Depthstrider's inherent reliance on weaponry acquired from the Void, seen as many Depthstriders wield Void-enhanced weaponry in even their base kits.

Depthstrider abilities arise when Curvature Manipulation comes into play. Induction of information and negative information (chalk and a hypothetical 'negative chalk') allows for creation curvature and anti-curvature along the fourth spatial dimension. This manifests as Depthstriders being able to control gravity. Their ability to control gravity is used mainly through creating points of attraction and repulsion to obtain spatial control of the battlefield. These powers also have considerable utilitarian applications, such as flight and moving large objects in large scale cases, or even moving pins in a lock or applying counter-acting forces on something to induce spin, such as to remove a screw.

Curvature manipulation works as a very ranged power, allowing applying considerable lethality from afar.

The other more esoteric powers of the Void come in the form of **Gifts of the Void**, a large grab-bag of tools, skills, powers and phenomena dredged from the depths of the Void, called upon when needed. While Giving normally has some issues with reliability, Depthstrider gifts suffer from these less so, instead seeing **Skews** in their gifts each time they are asked from the Void. These Skews are a result of the Void's inherent mathematics as presided over by the first Amaranth Sultan; Brother Vahn, and in particular the Void's **Anchor Variables** (described at length in [[The Void]] and [[Prop.Blackjack]]). The Skews slightly modify the Gift in question, and while these modifications can sometimes be interpreted as positive or negative, by and large they are random, and it is up to a skilled and creative Depthstrider to make use of Gifts as effectively as possible.

In addition to the **Gifts of the Void** are the **Possessions from the Void**. These are almost entirely similar to Gifts, except that they can be retrieved from the Void with total reliability, and suffer no Skews when they are. Possessions from the Void are Taken, and they are wielded by Depthstriders as a bit of determinability in the randomness of their arsenals.

As a noteworthy feature, Gifts and Possessions can **transition** between these states via the **formshift**. Returning something to the Void can allow for a Depthstrider to ask for it back as a Gift, or Take it as a possession. Thus this particular section of a Depthstrider's arsenal  - collectively called **Draws from the Void** - are subject to a sort of 'gambling' mechanic; draw with certainty by Taking, or ask to be Given and possibly reap greater rewards or suffer drawbacks.

While Depthstriders lack the Flash Protocol, what they have in place of it - somewhat - is the **Drift Protocol**. Depthstriders who undergo the pilgrimage to become **Void Drifters** obtain their final powers, the ability to Shape from the Void and the power to manipulate time using the DCC. Most wielders of the Void will never attain this lofty height of strength, but those that due fear almost nothing from their chalkweaver counterparts.

> Some notes; 
> One is that we still don't have a concrete explanation for what 'negative information' and thus 'negative chalk' is. The ideas I have are something to do with depthstones, and there is also the piece sent by Hex regarding Negative Information.
> As a snap idea, I'm considering the idea of Depthstriders being fond of the Switchboard's blunt, heavy martial weapons whereas Chalkweavers prefer blades and weapons that keep the hands unencumbered, this idea being based off the fact that Curvature Manipulation and thus gravity control eliminates most of the drawbacks that class of martial weapon has, and even enhances it by boosting their destructiveness through gravitational acceleration. Something can only be *so* cut, but the pulverizing force of a gravity-assisted hammer swing, performed with little or no cost to the wielder is nothing to scoff at.

#### Arsenal
T1 - **Void-Enhanced Armament**
Core to every Depthstrider's arsenal is their Void-enhanced armament, weaponry that is attuned with the depths of Isalveh, the Challenger Dark. They reap boons for their weapon class by drinking of the nature of all similar weapons in the Void; blades are made sharper by all blades in the Void, and guns shoot truer due to all guns present in the Void. Stardrip sees all information dissolve into it, and flow into all that is inculcated with it. Common to all Void weapons is the additional power to induce great depth - rifts - to the Challenger Dark, allowing transit to and fro, and acts of Giving and Taking. While Depthstriders can perform this inherently, with Void weapons they can focus their power allowing summoning and maintenance of the rift with greater ease.

- **Given/Taken Armament**
	Armament Given by or Taken from the Void. Taken armament are generally preferred over Given ones, as Taken ones are obtained with some amount of specificity. Void armament benefit in ways not too dissimilar from Chalk and Relic armaments, with a difference in that Void armament can 'siphon' chalk into the Challenger Dark, inducing depth and providing boons to the weapon.
	
- **Forged Armament**
	A weapon crafted and then left to marinate in stardrip, taking on the power of the Void. In some manners it serves as an improvement over Given or Taken weaponry, such as not needing to be stored in the Void (and thus is always available) as well as total control over the nature of the weapon itself, built to the demands of the wielder rather than the best-fitting implement salvaged from the depths of the Amaranth. It however loses out on the depth-leeching effect of Given/Taken weapons that make them grow stronger as they engage with calcic opposition. Amara-forged weapons require a core of amaranthite in their construction, as a note.

> Regarding Forged Armament and Forging in general, update the relevant documents on information about **amaranthite**, a common crystalline solid formed in the Challenger Dark, and how it sees wide application in Depthstrider purposes, particular in amara-forged weaponry, which needs a material foundation of amaranthite to function.

T2 - **Curvature Manipulation**
Depthstriders boast dominance over information curvature, the changes in fourth-dimensional altitude induced by the presence of information or the lack thereof. Their powers of information and anti-information produce curvature and anti-curvature in a localized space, and thus allow for the control of gravity. Weaponization of this power sees the beginning of the Depthstrider's abilities.

- **Point Attraction**
	Information is concentrated to a space and great depth is induced. Like pushing down a film held taut, local space is stretched downwards, and untethered objects are pulled towards it. Should the depth be great enough, objects can be shunted into the depths of the Dark.
	
- **Point Repulsion**
	Anti-curvature is caused by the gathering of anti-information, creating a mountain-like peak in the fourth dimension of local space. Like objects dropped on a wide cone, they race away from the center to areas of lower elevation.
	
- **Selective Action**
	Constraining forces of attraction and repulsion, using points of each to cancel out the force exerted by the other, allows for fine control of what is attracted and repelled. Large feats such as flying or moving heavy objects can be achieved with immense dexterity, as well as smaller feats such as picking locks or disassembling intricate machinery.
	
- **Paired Points**
	The forces of attraction and repulsion can see themselves constrained to act only on each other, seeing the ability for Depthstriders to mark targets with differing points, and have them inexplicably drawn to each other. The usefulness of this power are constrained only by imagination. 

T3 - **Draws from the Void**
Perhaps the power that separates Depthstriders from others the most is their ability to draw from the depths of the Void. Asking the depths to be Given a shard of their bounty, or Taking it through finely-honed will, only those who are either true or adopted kin of the first Amaranth Sultan Vahn are able to reach into the Deep and drink of its bottomless riches. 

- **Gifts of the Void**
	Various boons granted to those who ask of the Void. Considering that what can be Given is only what is available, and what is available is all that has found its way into the Challenger Dark over the thousands of precessions that it has existed, what can be Given is nearly anything. Powers, skills, weapons, armor, information; anything a kin of Vahn may need, the Sultan generously bestows, and asking for these same things sees them become attuned to the one who is Given, allowing them to call upon their Gifts with regularity and greater strength, the Skews imparted on it being slanted in their favor.
	
- **Possessions from the Void**
	Like the Gifts, but often, what can't be Given must be Taken. Depthstriders strong in will reach into the Dark and wrench from it their exact demands, inheriting boons from ancestor-kin and unfortunate victims long ago. When pulled with the specificity of a directed mind, it
	
- **Draw Strike**
	In communing with the Void, one sees their full minds focused on the depths. Opportunistic foes of Vahn's kin believe they can exploit these moments for lucky strikes, but find soon that anything pulled from the Void is followed - always - with more than just what was asked for.
	
- **Formshift**
	A Gift can be returned and then Taken instead, and something Taken can be returned and asked for as a Gift. This transiting of forms allows for a power of the Void to return with predictability and specificity, or with random boons from Skews. Skilled Depthstriders perform this frequently - often even in the heat of battle - to reap benefits of both, fighting with predictability and consistency when needed, or leaving the Switchboard's dangers in the hands of their ancestor-kin Vahn.

T4 - **The Deep Hollow**
> The canon explanations for this power remain WIP. This is subject to change, thus.

Depthstriders, Vahnkin - blood or not - all form a connection with the first Amaranth Sultan and his household. Through deep conviction in the nature and thus philosophy of the Void, they imbibe its doctrine, and see their power elevated as a result. As conviction in this doctrine grows, so too does the power of those convicted, until a threshold is reached and will can be given form. Immersing oneself into the Void, and reaching into oneself to Take allows for grabbing hold of their conviction - and with it - excavating a pocket realm where the doctrine of the Void and the kin of Vahn reigns supreme. This is the Deep Hollow; the conviction-space, the holy grounds for Vahn's kin. The place for heretics in this space is on altars.

Within the Deep Hollow, the chalk wielded by Chalkweavers is rapidly drained, and the Strider Protocol cannot be performed due to the sheer localized curvature induced in the space. Attempting to Stride requires overcoming ones on information mass, as well as escaping the massive pull of the Void. Depthstriders in this space see cross-arsenal improvements; buffs in strength to void armament, Given and Taken boons from the Void increased in their various forms of potency, including their more refined alignment to the wishes of the Hollow caster. Formshifting can be performed rapidly alongside Giving and Taking, and the Draw Strike is further empowered. 

When cast by a Void Drifter, time in a Hollow becomes clay in their hands. Few escape these hallowed grounds.

The Hollow itself manifests in three stages, that being grand cathedral-like structures that grow in splendor and morph in decoration based on the nature of the caster - and later - based on which kin of Vahn they call upon to further escalate the Hollow to its final state. These cathedrals in the Dancirah occupy physical space, and cannot be breached from the outside except through particularly esoteric means. They persist until the Hollow is dismissed by the caster within, or the cast is broken through some means.

- **Deep Hollow**
	A Depthstrider performs a gesture similar to a Chalkweaver, then reaches into a rift in the Void placed upon their forehead, chest or stomach. To those observing, they pull out pure scintillating night, and the physical structure of the Hollow assembles around them by prenatural hands, erupting from a tear in the ground - from the Void - sheets and blocks and pillars of amaranthite and depthstone assembling the structure. Those inside at the time of the cast are trapped within, and those on the outside may not breach the Hollow's walls.
	
	The power of a summoned Hollow depends on the conviction of the caster, and thus these hollows come in three tiers, escalating in power, splendor and gaining new functions as they grow. All Hollows are additionally subject to **praxis mechanics**, which is what allows them to draw strength from others at the doctrinal level. This presents additional risk to those caught in their grasp, as feasibly, the only way to break out of a Hollow is with praxis abilities.
	
	- **Hollow Edicula**: The first tier, small but with great room to grow. This space is formed from a maturing acolyte of the depth's conviction, and within this space they reap the rewards of their conviction and the Amaranth Sultan's favor. Within the Edicula they see buffs to their arsenal, and weight placed on the shoulders of their foes. The first power in the most elementary rule is that of placing the **Forbid of the Faithful**, a rule that burdens all but the kin of Vahn in the space. The limitations of this power is that the power to maintain it must also be drawn as the Edicula is being built, and so even among those who may only summon the Hollow Edicula, the resulting structure varies. Those burdened with this Forbid see a gradual draining of their chalk into the structure of the Hollow, inducing further localized curvature, accelerating the drain, and strengthening the Hollow and the Depthstrider within it. Elementary enhancements are seen to the caster's arsenal here, in particular their powers of Give, Take, Formshift and the Draw Strike.
	
	- **Hollow Basilica**: The second tier of Deep Hollow, summoned with the conviction of matured kin of Vahn, drawing additionally from the latent power gained from the fellowship with fellow kin, and the evangelical conversion of those untouched by the depths to their ranks. The Basilica is the most widespread tier of Hollow used by Depthstriders in active conflict, and this is due to the **Binding of the Acolyte** inflicted to all within the Hollow's space. The Binding of the Acolyte is a mechanical burden placed on all within the Hollow at the praxis level, and this Binding compels those under it to act in certain ways to resolve the Hollow cast. A Binding has a 'win' and 'fail' state, and Bindings operate by compelling those under them to perform an action that serves to worship the Amaranth Sultan. Primarily, bindings are used as attacks against non-Vahnkin. That being said however, bindings can be 'solved' or reach their 'win' state, and whatever adverse effect they would have suffered from triggering the 'fail' state would be averted, causing the Hollow to resolve and collapse.
	  
		- Consider this hypothetical; a Depthstrider summons their Hollow Basilica, catching both them and an attacking Chalkweaver within it. Once the Basilica forms, the Binding is invoked, the nature of the Binding being that both occupants of the Hollow are provided a piece of fruit, and they must consume it as fast as possible. Whoever finishes first is said to have 'fulfilled their binding' to worship the Amaranth Sultan through their actions, and they reach a 'win' state, with the other suffering the Binding's 'fail' state. Should the Depthstrider win under this Binding, the Chalkweaver's chalk could be drained and the Depthstrider empowered as a result. Should the Chalkweaver win however, the Depthstrider would have failed to worship Vahn, running counter to their doctrine, and suffering heavy praxis damage as a result. Under both circumstances, the Hollow will collapse upon fulfilling the Binding.
		  
		  - There are some elements of further customization to the entire affair, with Depthstriders able to alter the nature of the Binding, the win and fail states, the rewards and consequences incurred and endured by relevant parties, how fairly these are allocated, and the like. Nonetheless, it is at the second tier that the Deep Hollow truly becomes a force to be reckoned with.
	
	- **Hollow Cathedra**: The final tier of the Deep Hollow, formed by an acolyte that joins their conviction to the conviction of a direct descendant of Vahn, a progeny-apostolic who leads sects of their own. Within the Cathedra, the depths of the Void are made sharp by the powers of praxis. Those who still refuse to kneel are afflicted with the **Curse of the Sultan**; should they be felled in the galley of the Cathedra, they will be dragged down to the depths they so scorn, banished from the lands above to be burned in the violet flames of the deep.
	  
		- This particular ability is lauded as one of the strongest Depthstrider techniques, second only to their ability to control literal time. The ability to - under some circumstances - rather easily banish even the strongest combatants to the hostile depths of the Void, is of great concern to many, and high-ranking Vahnic faithful are considered formidable opponents, often to the point of it being forbidden to engage them in battle.

T5 - **The Drift Protocol**
Pilgrimage to the tomb of Vahn - a sign of utmost dedication and kinship with him - sees those who undergo it granted the last secrets in the Void's depths. They become Void Drifters as a result, and there is no barrier that they cannot cross, and no desire that they cannot carve from the depths of the Void. Their final power comes in the manipulation of localized space's relationship with time, allowing Void Drifters to end fights before they ever even began, or conclude engagements in the space of an eyeblink.

- **Shaped Armament**
	The deployment of will perfected. Void Drifters reach into the Void with a vacuum in their hands, the bounds of it their desire, and the stuff of the Challenger Dark fills it with exacting precision. Exact wants are met. That which does not exist assembles to become. 
	
- **Chronodynamism**
	Manipulation of the dynamic coupling constant sees Void Drifters able to trade amounts of distortion of space for various amounts of distortion of time. This power sees them able to control time as they see fit, constrained to specific locales, as only the Astrolabe has complete dominance over the domain of the temporal. Changes made by Void Drifters resolve themselves as necessary, as debts of any form must be paid back for the smooth running of the Switchboard.

### Pale Amaran
Chalk and Void stand seemingly as opposing elements to each other, and while this is true in various cases, the Switchboard is filled with oddities that challenge existing conceptions. The simultaneous wielding of Chalk and Void derivative powers results in the 'Pale Amaran', a combat class so named due to the means Chalk and Void powers are often bridged; the crystal-alloy pale amara.

Pale amara sees chalk and amaranthite (emblematic of the Void) combined into a stable form, and this contradictory union has the property of granting the lattice of an interested party the power to wield both effectively. Implanting pale amara into the body where it makes contact with the lattice serves to establish a bridge between the subject and the Challenger Dark or the Dancirah dependent on who it is gifted too. 

Pale Amara 'grafts' see more wide use among Chalkweavers who dip into the depths of the Void merely for more power, and don't see much use among Depthstriders, who's wielding of the Void is a doctrinal - almost religious - practice, one that they forgo their chalkweaving powers to perform. 

Subscribing to both 'schools' sees Pale Amarans able to use powers from either, and even combining them to form unique powers of their own. That doesn't come without some compromises however; Pale Amarans aren't able to use the Flash Protocol, or powers derived from the Drift Protocol. There is also a soft limit on the power and complexity of the rituals they can cast, as well as their inability to be Given by the Void; any boons reaped from the Void must be Taken, and boons Taken by Pale Amarans are subject to Skews, which seemingly have a consistent negative slant. They cannot use curvature manipulation beyond elementary attraction and repulsion, and cannot wield multiple Teks or weave shields.

In turn however, they gain access to the **Polarity** powers; powers that exploit the differences and divide between Chalk and the Void and their interactions as weaponry. The Polarity powers function by declaring a '**spectrum**' between Chalk and the Void, and drawing on either to certain degrees to operate. Pale Amarans thus can lean more to the side of Chalk (**White**) or Void (**Black**), and this sees a bolstering of some part of their arsenals and a weakening of others.

In particular, Pale Amarans are able to tap into a source of power - a source of pure chalk - that is only possible due to their attunement to the Void; the [[The Challenger Dark#The Stardrip Cycle|Stardrip Cycle]]. The Stardrip Cycle is a mechanism by which chalk that passes the Challenger Horizon into the Void becomes the amaranth stardrip, which flows deep into the core of the Void, is 'purified' back into pure chalk, and then returned back to the Great Sky through volcano-like structures in the Challenger Dark. Pale Amarans are able to tap into this reservoir of pure chalk through their ability to reach into the Dark, and this reservoir of chalk serves to empower their '**White**' Polarity powers.

In turn, the mechanics of chalk are able to interact with the Void, particularly that chalk equations are able to alter the resultants of the Void's calculations, in particular the **Skews** that are imposed on the boons Pale Amarans plunder from the Void. Weave can also be used even in the plundering step, allowing Pale Amarans to reap more exact boons from the depths of the Void with lessened drawbacks. Alteration of the skews to their Void-plundered boons serve to bolster their '**Black**' Polarity powers.

Full Spectra techniques use chalk and Void to extreme degrees, similar to '[[Chalk Ritualism#Horizon Ritualism|Horizon Ritualism]]', a form of the chalk ritualism that makes use of Void-based components.

#### Arsenal
T1 - **Polarized Armaments**
Pale Amarans stride the lines of metaphorical white and black, wielding powers from the calcic and the depths alike. Through the pale amara woven into their lattice, where contradiction should be found, cooperation now takes root, and their powers in one domain augment and fuel the other. 

- **Woven Armament - White**
	Chalk-based or calcic weaponry wielded by a Pale Amaran, taking the form of a woven weapon or relic. Curiously, calcic weapons in the hands of a Pale Amaran benefit from a sort of 'encasement' provided by the Void, in that depth is induced on their calcic armaments, and thus they see chalk 'pool' towards and into them, empowering them further.
	
- **Stolen Armament - Black**
	Pale Amarans are by some understandings, false kin of Vahn. The depths of the Void are not open to them the way it is open to true kin and adopted kin. This does not stop the Pale Amaran however, who gladly robs the depths of the powers they contain. This thievery does not escape the eyes of the First Sultan however, who smites the plundered boons with wicked Skews. The Pale Amaran's attunement with chalk, however, allows for treating the Skews as Weave, and thus utilizing them in new ways.

> As a note for the following, while Pale Amarans ultimately strive to obtain a balance between the calcic and the depths and draw power from both, depending on what side they began and thus moved from, their T2 and T3 arsenal may vary. Starting as a Chalkweaver will grant Polar White at the T3 level. Starting as a Depthstrider will grant Polar Black at the T3 level. Having a T3 in one side generally prevents you from having the T3 of the other side.

T2/3 - **Polar White**
Powers that borrow from Chalkweavers and the domain of Chalk. In the Polarity powers, these lean more on the calcic side of the spectrum. That being said, they do benefit from their marriage to the power of the depths, particularly doing so in the form of Pale Amarans being able to tap into the **stardrip cycle** that occurs in the Challenger Dark. This provides a plentiful reservoir of pure chalk to draw upon, meaning that Pale Amarans are able to cast weave and use calcic powers without needing to draw upon latent chalk, and thus aren't vulnerable to measures that work to oppose 'drawing' chalk. A result of this, however, is that most spectrum weave abilities require 'charging' or preparation. 

- T2 - **Spectrum Strike**
	Similar to the Weave Strike, but the control over local depths allow Pale Amarans to tap into the Stardrip Cycle. This deep reservoir of chalk allows for Spectrum Strikes to hit significantly harder than the Weave Strikes, but require drawing from the depths of the Void for a period of time.
	
- T2 - **Spectrum Charge**
	Again, similar to the Weave Charge, but able to be charged from the reservoir of Chalk in the Stardrip Cycle. Additionally, plundered boons from the Void can be bound into the Spectrum Charge, and used as blasts, hurled grenades, or channeled imbues.
	
- T2 - **Spectrum Shift**
	In place of the Spectrum Dash, Pale Amarans posses the **Spectrum Shift**. This ability used by Pale Amarans is a rather interesting one; in place of a dash technique, they perform a short '**blink**'. By delving briefly - but not totally - into the Void and reemerging elsewhere, Pale Amarans are able to reposition without interference from threats in the Dancirah. Similarly, delving briefly into the Dancirah from the Void and reemerging elsewhere allows for a similar effect. Delving in and out of realms sees them emerge with a 'corona' of the nature of the realm they are emerging from, and allows them to perform an attack or action similar to the Depthstrider's Draw Strike, known as the **Aura Strike**.
	
- T3 - **Tainted Tek**
	Pale Amarans are still able to wield Teks, and often they obtain Teks from the reservoir of the stardrip cycle. While mostly unchanged from regular Teks, occasionally Teks that are 'tainted' with stardrip arise in the Stardrip Cycle, and differ from regular Teks in that they may possess dynamic Skews, or are able to manipulate curvature. These Teks are preferred by Pale Amarans.

T2/3 - **Polar Black**
Powers that borrow from Depthstriders and the domain of the Void, leaning on the depths side of the Polarity powers. The power of the calcic enhances the Void by adding calculation and certainty to where there would normally be randomness. Placing control in their own hands, Pale Amarans plunder what they see fit from the depths of the Void, eliminating the will of the Amaranth Sultan and the skews he inflicts as punishment for insolence. Additionally, the power to wield and manipulate chalk directly grants for enhanced spatial control, though precision is lost where power is gained.

- T2 - **Point Collapse**
	The Point Attraction power borrowed from the Depthstriders and enhanced with additional power at the expense of control. Rapidly forming singularities of ultra-dense chalk cause objects in the vicinity to crash and collapse violently upon that point.
	
- T2 - **Point Expulsion**
	The Point Repulsion power, also borrowed from Depthstriders and enhanced at the cost of precision. Vacating all chalk in a region causes a rapid increase in the spatial curvature, cause objects caught in its effects to explode violently.
	
- T3 - **Plunder from the Void**
	Chief among the Pale Amaran's Polar Black powers, their power to open rifts to the Void allows them to plunder its depths, not able to be Given as they are not kin of Vahn, and not being able to Take as they haven't inherited the bounty of the Void by being kin with Vahn. Instead they rob the depths of the Void, stealing power for themselves. Plunder taken in this manner is subject to negative Skews, levied against them by the ever-watchful First Sultan, but the Pale Amarans proficiency with Chalk sees them able to modify these Skews as though they were weave, and work them to the Pale Amaran's advantage. 

T4 - **Conjoined Polarity**
The juxtaposition of the opposing powers and doctrines of the calcic and the depths is the crux of the Pale Amaran's hubris. These schools clash within them, the depths in the pale amaranthite stabbed into their lattice finding it hostile, and as sea meets sky, a horizon is formed. This horizon is a superposition of calm and chaos, both bound in the body of the Pale Amaran, who grips both firmly to achieve their own ends. The Conjoined Polarity sees the final boundaries enforcing the polarity collapse upon themselves, and allows the Pale Amaran to mix both schools and cast techniques drawing upon both.

- **Horizon Ritualism**
	The [[Chalk Ritualism#Horizon Ritualism|Horizon Ritualism]] is a branch of the elementary Chalk Ritualism, differing in that the Horizon Ritualism can make use of Void-originating components and ritual geometry is drawn with pale amara in dust form. Horizon ritual schema are able to interact with the Void and Void subject matter such as Giving, Taking, forging, Shaping, curvature manipulation, the depthstride, stardrip and the control of time. Offensive Horizon rituals see great effectiveness against calcic targets.
	
- **Aural Riposte**
	Briefly shunting to one plane from another gathers up the aura of that plane, and upon reemergence this aura can be woven into powerful casts against those awaiting them on the other side. Blinking in and out of these planes sees shifts in the aura that can be imbibed to increase one's own power, or weaponized against targets of the opposing polarity.

T5 - **Full Spectra**
As though it were not enough to merely collapse the boundaries between things, the greed and hubris of the Pale Amaran knows no bounds, as they treat all of polarity as a well merely for them to draw on. Utilizing the Full Spectra requires true understand of balance, an understanding that goes as high as the doctrinal level, and once this is achieved, one need not bother differentiating white or black ever again. All is merely power, coalesced in the open palm.

- **Full Spectra Techniques**
	How an individual chooses to use true command over both schools vary, but the results are often catastrophic, leading many to suspect that perhaps the Pale Amaran - in their nigh-childish approach to the rules of such things - is perhaps the wisest and thus strongest of all. What is certain then, that Full Spectra techniques are formed at the culmination of a journey to a lofty height, and those who aim to perform that journey with only a single metaphorical foot will be felled by it. Inescapably.


### Esomechanist
This super-'class' isn't so much a class, and is rather a means of describing a wide range of abilities and combat styles that may not explicitly have a Chalk or Void backbone. This 'dump' category sees all kinds of fighting styles developed by those unable or unwilling to use the more formal powers to fight, and Esomechanists instead build their arsenals around other things, such as Slates, Chromegrafts and even Glass.

As such, it is hard to define the powers of Esomechanists as a category, though the more common bases upon which Esomechanists majorly operate *can* be defined. 

- **Slate Esos** boast considerable power over all things technological and digital, and the ability of Slates to interfere with the Calcic grants them a degree of control over that as well. Their control over machines sees them fight effectively by taking control of Chromelings or self-built mechanical constructs, while interfering with the abilities of opponents (especially chalk-reliant ones) with their Slates. Particularly advanced Slate Esos can perform a very elementary form of chalk weaving as well.

- **Chromegraft Esos** are immensely varied, relying on various grafts installed into their lattices for their means of combat. Wrist-mounted machine guns, self-replenishing missile back-mounts, spring-loaded joints for mobility, rocket assemblies built into the legs for flight, chest-mounted laser cannons; chromegrafts boast considerable variety and versatility.

- **Glass Esos** are particularly esoteric in nature, as the crux of their power is are Glass jaws; rifts between the Dancirah and the Vitric Shelf through which beings can move between each, and Glass finds its way into the Great Sky below. There are... methods to have these Jaws become actual jaws, and Glass Esos are defined primarily by a mouthful of jagged, translucent daggers, with a scintillating kaleidoscopic maw behind them. This passageway to the Vitric Shelf allows from drawing Glass when needed, and glass teeth are used to hone and shape it down to forms required by the subject. At higher levels of strength and skill, the power to open temporary maws in space is obtained, and summoning jagged protrusions of Glass in space sees the possibilities available to them widen considerably.

## The Relics of New
The Relics, Thy Mettle 2.0, updated with the new name, in-line with the fresh canon, and taking on the new name and lore of CARP - the Collaborative Artificial Relics Project.

### The Natural Relics
![[The Hands as Chalk#^abc506]]

Natural Relics in the Switchboard arise through the mechanics of spontaneous equations; chalk gathers and accumulates around something - a concept, object, something that can serve as a 'seed' for something grander - and it takes on patterns that grant it powers beyond its mundane nature.  ^a3de16

These patterns often are drawn from the surroundings or produced by the implements own weave (such as a sword producing the pattern for sharpness). While they lack the versatility and direction in purpose possessed by the artificial relics, their creation from the raw stuff of the Switchboard seeping into them over eons makes them immensely powerful. 

### The Artificial Relics
As a matter of necessity, the earliest Chalkstriders learned to make Artificial Relics. Originally this was done by simply letting mundane implements marinate in chalk-dense environments, but the practice was refined by the usage of rituals to fold patterns that produced the desired changes into mundane implements. The use of these early artificial relics was in casting more advanced rituals, combat and utility, and opposing the various problematic equations existing in the Switchboard.

As such, relics were a means to direct a Strider's power. Often, a Strider 'casts' their various powers with their relic in hand, serving as an inlet and outlet, a bridge between them and the Switchboard. With natural relics being too rare, artificial relics provided on-demand power for Striders in need.

#### The Collaborative Artificial Rituals Project (CARP)
	This section delves into Switchboard canon.

It became a problem for the early Chalkstriders that in the making of artificial relics, they would have to subject them to an extensive list of rituals that were time-consuming, expensive and risky to perform. As they journeyed further into the Switchboard, they faced new challenges and needed to either create new tools or modify old ones to keep their arsenal up-to-date. The craft of creating relics became convoluted, overly fragmented and fraught with additional problems. It was agreed upon that a central body that coordinated and created a standardized model for all relics in the Switchboard would be optimal. 

This task was lain at the feet of the newly budding Academy, which plumbed through many iterations before finally reaching the **Collaborative Artificial Relics Project**, shortened to **CARP**. CARP was basically a collaborative of Striders dedicated to producing standardized ritual schema that when cast upon a mundane implement, would convert it to a '**CARP relic**' that would have immense power and versatility right from the get-go, usable immediately as a tool for tackling the various dangers and challenges of the Switchboard. 

As Striders traverse the Switchboard and encounter new frontiers and all that they bring, this information is taken back to the CARP and its subdivision's  development teams, analyzed and assessed, with conclusions drawn on how to improve the next iteration of the CARP ritual schema. As with any on-going collaborative endeavor, frequent checks are made to trim away accumulated fat and rot, keeping the entire project streamlined and potent.

Of particular note is the schema produced by the **Modular Offensives Division** under CARP, responsible for the creation of the Academy's weaponry used by their various actors, particularly their Operators. The '**MOD**' schema, as it's shortened to, confers mundane weaponry with considerable power and - most importantly - **modularity**, allowing individual Striders to 'mod' the resulting relic as they saw fit, ensuring it fills a niche no other could in their repertoire.

Each iteration of CARP and their subdivision's ritual schema would be denoted by 'AAAA-XXX' where 'AAAA' was the subdivision that handled the particular schema in question - or CARP themselves, and the 'XXX' being the 'iteration number' of the schema - how many versions of has passed since the initial. It became common for Academy Striders to make personal 'forks' of the root CARP ritual schema, often to make them more compatible with other powers the Strider possesses, or to grant it powers and capabilities either not yet implemented in the root schema or removed from newer iterations of it. These forks would typically be denoted by 'CARP-XXX-F#YYYY', the 'F#' (pronounced 'F Sharp') indicating the fork of the CARP or subdivision schema version mentioned, and the 'YYYY' being an alphanumeric string that refers to who crafted the fork.

	In the canon, the latest iteration of the MOD schema is #046, making all relics that use it have a preceeding denotation of 'MOD-046', followed by the relic's name. As a better example, Adven Ventura, the Strider-Sojourner wields a pair of relic revolvers bearing the denotation 'MOD-046-F#VEN4: Sojourner's Tale'.

#### Relic Forging
The mundane component that becomes any kind of artificial relic benefits greatly from it's own construction and functionality as well, as many benefits added by the ritual applied primarily enhance the pre-existing nature of the subject implement. As a clarification, however, a ritual will not typically grant powers to a relics that are too far a stretch of the imagination for it to have.

A relic that is a sword or similar, will not gain the ability to function like a firearm, nor will a relic based on a firearm function as a sword. Striders craft their pre-relics to exacting specifications before imbuing them with the power of a ritual to complete them as relics.

As mentioned earlier, these relics benefit from their construction. The usage of high-quality materials and craftsmanship go a long way to improving the final relic product. More subjectively, the care put by a Strider in the crafting process and how well it relates to the Strider making it also affect the information tangible qualities of the relic, and serve to enhance its power and deepen the unity between it and the Strider that made it. 

### Prime Relics (PHldr.)
Prime Relics are a subdivision of natural relics, forming only under extreme circumstances. These circumstances vary, but in the canon so far, the only means of forming a Prime Relic are using a collapsed region's [[The Skywards Pursuit#The Gravity Axle |Gravity Axle]], or via a [[Chalk Ritualism#Structural Casting |Structural Cast]]. When wielded by a Strider, they read their lattice and refold themselves to be best suited to be wielded by that Strider and reflect the doctrine that guides them. Their power is unmatched in the ability to cause vast, sweeping change to the Switchboard.

	Further detail here is narrative-dependent.

### Appendum
	Carp is a fish. There might be place for some cool fish symbology in it all. 

### Further Notes
#### Terminology
Differentiating between a **relic** and an **artifact**.
- **Relics** are used to describe calcic-enhanced **weaponry**. As a term, it's used almost exclusively to refer to calcic weaponry enhanced by means of weave or a ritual baked into it.
- **Artifacts** refer to nearly everything non-offensive or combative that has been enhanced by chalk.

## Further Notes
Additional notes on the topic.

**Weaving** is forming something out of ribbon chalk. If an attack uses primarily raw ribbon chalk and equation in its formation, that attack is said to be **woven**. Weave-centric attacks are the ones highlighted under the [[On Weave and Warfare#Weave Powers|Weave Powers]] sections of this document. Striders 'weave' constructs such as equation grenades or shields to aid them in combat. 

A **Cast** is a broad term applied to any Strider power that is generally defined by exclusivity or complexity. A Strider 'casts' their Tek, 'casts' with their relic, and 'casts' rituals. If an power is granted by a [[The Blank-Slate Mind#Titular Powers|title]], it is 'casted' as well. A Strider is said to be 'preparing a cast' if they are winding up to use one of these abilities. Unlike Weaves, Casts typically have 'cooldowns', or some constraint that prevents them from having constant uptime - unless otherwise stated.

### Weapons - Classes
Weapons in the Switchboard are broadly classifiable into martial and ranged weaponry. Ranged weapons encompass majorly different forms of firearms, further classified by damage methodology and effective range. Melee or martial weapons encompass collections of piercing and bludgeoning weapons designed for use in close ranges. further classified according to their weight and own damage methodology in the form of 'edge', ranging from high edge piercing weapons to low edge bludgeoning weapons.

#### Ranged Weapons
**Damage Methodology** describes how the weapon does damage, with **Effective Range** describing the distance between the user and a target at which the weapon is most effective. With that explained, we can use the Grid Methodology to create an ensemble of weapon types used in the Switchboard.

|   | Close Quarters  | Medium Range  | Long Range/Marksman  |
|---|---|---|---|
|Driven Ballistics|Submachine Guns/PDWs  <br>Handcannons  <br>Sidearms  <br>Shotguns|Combat Rifles  <br>Marksman Rifles  <br>Combat Bows  <br>Machine Guns/SAWs|Sniper Rifles  <br>Linecharge Weapon Systems|
|Energy & Esoterica|Flechette 'Accelerator' Rifles|'Accelerator' Rifles  <br>Focus/Beam Rifles|Precision 'Accelerator' Rifles|
|Ordnance & Media|Breech-loaded Shell Launchers|Rotary/Drum Shell Launchers|Rocket/Missile Delivery Platforms|
   

##### Elaboration
**Damage Methodology**
The method of doing damage by a weapon.
- '**Driven Ballistics**' are any and all weapons characterized by being propelled gravity-affected projectiles. Regarding propulsion, it can be accomplished through various means, such as chemically-driven rounds in firearms in conventional firearms, pure muscle power in the case of **combat bows**, and electromagnetism in the case of **railguns**.
- '**Energy & Esoterica**' is a fairly broad category that encompasses mainly any and all imaginings of 'particle'-based weaponry; 'laser-weapons' and all their many siblings and cousins fit under this category. 
- '**Ordnance & Media**' describe a class of weapons typically denoted as 'heavy' in games. It encompasses all manners of explosive weapons, but is also suitable for describing weapons who's damage is dealt through media such as fire from flamethrowers or acid or ultracool liquid dispensed via some delivery method.

**Handcannons, Sidearms, Combat Rifles, Marksman Rifles**
A series of driven ballistic weaponry, serving as analogues to real-world weapons.
- **Handcannons** are massively upscaled revolver-style handguns, characterized by high caliber rounds and unrivalled precision for their formfactor. Greatly beloved by Striders, especially the Academy's Operators due to their relatively small size, ease of handling, and their use as relics in casting due to various actions performed in their operation (chambering rounds, spinning the cylinder, slapping the cylinder back into position, cocking the hammer, 'fanning' the hammer) are very usable as the [[Chalk Ritualism#Inter-step; The 'Seal'|Seal]] in a ritual cast or the trigger condition for another calcic power. 
- **Sidearms** are the handcannon's smaller cousins, resembling more conventional pistol-style handguns fed with magazines. By virtue of their lower caliber rounds they get more per magazine and benefit from higher fire rates and lower recoil. Typically, they are used as their name implies; a 'side' weapon to a more powerful main weapon.
- **Combat Rifles** describes an absolutely massive selection of weapons, ranging from rifles to carbines to assault rifles, modified by variant such as bullpup configurations, fully and semi automatic variants and more. Most weapons imaginable go under this category. Operators typically use them in high-intensity situations, and are still very capable of casting calcic powers with them. A unique property of theirs is select-fire switches, allowing single, burst, and fully automatic fire.
- **Marksman Rifles** are better seen as a fork of combat rifles, occupying an intersection of combat rifles and sniper rifles. They exist primarily to provide high power, highly accurate fire in mobile formfactors, achieving so through using more powerful rounds than combat rifles, more exacting construction, but done so with an insistence that they are kept lighter than their sniper rifle older brothers. Marksman Rifles are a preferred choice among high-level Striders who find themselves wanting a caster-class weapon with far more combative power and effectiveness over long ranges. Their increased size, larger calibers and reliability born out of precision and more exacting design makes them ideal platforms for delivering devastating calcic-enhanced attacks. 

**Combat Bows**
A medieval staple finds its way to a modern battlefront.
- The trope of archers in a world of guns continues into the Switchboard.
- The major reasoning for the usage of bows in the Switchboard revolves around their utility as '**caster**' weapons; weapons that function well with calcic abilities. The tactility, interactivity, how involved they are in their operation, presents multiple nodes of action that can serve as the seals and trigger points for rituals and other calcic powers. Similar to **handcannons**, combat bows excel at being used as the backbone of a very calcic style of fighting employed by powerful Operators, who's damage potential relies primarily on their calcic abilities.
- On the actual weapon itself, modifications made to its construction and operation escalates to a formidable weapon. Above all, the inculcation of the **MOD** ritual already bestows it with a litany of buffs to it's efficacy, but deliberate construction choices such as usage of advanced and metamaterials considerably increases the power of overall weapon. Arrows being a limited resource typically is circumvented by the fact most archer-Striders simply weave their arrows from ribbon chalk, granting the ability to imbue them with powerful properties, granting them considerable versatility. 

**Sniper Rifles**
- A somewhat umbrella term for high power, immensely precise rifle-style weapons. Beginning just above the threshold for marksman rifles, sniper rifles see the end of their category around the mark at which they become capable of defeating heavily armored targets and throwing rounds multiple kilometers downrange. Enhanced by the MOD rituals, they become truly fearsome weapons.
- The higher calibers used by sniper-class weapons in the Switchboard make them far more suitable for enhancing with **caedometric** or anti-lattice properties, making them a weapon class almost specifically designed for killing Striders.

**Line Arms**
- A broad category of weapons defined by usage of '**linecharge**' systems in their operation. Line charge enabled weapons in the Switchboard typically feature a pair or more parallel rails in their assembly, as well as powerful **hyperweave capacitors**. These capacitors are able to store considerable amounts of hyperweave provided by a source such as an **entropic weft compressor**; a device designed to create maximally chaotic servings of hyperweave. In addition to storing hyperweave, the main advantage of these capacitors is that they are able to dump massive amounts of hyperweave in fractions of a second once triggered.
- This hyperweave is dumped along the rail assembly, these rails being essential as they are in fact, artificial relics, inscribed with the **Jaunteer Equation**; a chalk equation that serves as a considerably low-power analogue to the Strider Protocol, used primarily in spacecraft enginery. In a linecharge weapon, it is able to fire a projectile with ludicrous velocity, by charging hyperweave in the capacitors and dumping them down the rails.
- Because they need to charge before every shot, they are thus fairly slow, and because they deal with hyperweave, they are particularly dangerous to operate. For this reason, line arms see much of their usage in ultra-long range precision applications, where the linecharge weapon is additionally supplemented by Slate guidance apparatus and elaborate firing rigs.
- The Spyndl Academy in particular is known for their **Star Snipers**; specialized operators who operate linecharge firing apparatus from low orbit. Whereas firing pure weave would be disrupted by a region's calcic climate, a solid projectile can be ritually and machine-honed to exacting specifications, granting it unrivalled performance for the task at hand. Spyndl's star snipers can thus annihilate a target wholly undetected and unchallenged, allowing the exertion and projection of force in a manner resembling the utmost divine.  


**Accelerator, Flechette and Precision Accelerator Rifles**
- These are more commonly referred to as **Axxel**, **Fraxxel** and **Praxxel** rifles.
- This is a weapon class defined primarily by it's weaponization of **hyperweave**. Through the usage of entropic weft compressors, they form and fire blasts of destructive hyperweave, doing considerable damage to struck targets. Usually, they have hyperweave cells/batteries in their assembly as a buffer between forming the hyperweave and firing it.
- Axxel rifles are analogous to the combat rifle weapon class, opting for faster firing rates at the cost of damage, range and precision. Praxxel rifles are the precision equivalent, a counterpart to sniper rifles; opting for damage, range and precision over those longer ranges at the expense of firing speed.
- Fraxxel rifles function somewhat differently, featuring instead a multiple-barrel assembly that allows for firing shotgun-like 'spreads' of hyperweave bolts. 
- Axxel rifles often have multiple firing modes, these being semi-automatic, burst-fire, fully automatic and full-auto burst. Burst configurations often have multiplied internal workings (such as three barrels in three-shot burst configurations), that ready and fire a number of hyperweave bolts in succession.
- Praxxel rifles may have hyperweave capacitors built in as well, which can be charged by the batteries and allow for overcharged shots that do increasingly more damage, though the weapon systems must be built to accommodate such function.
- Fraxxel rifles typically fire a somewhat ordered spread of hyperweave bolts, boasting high raw damage but low stability and integrity over long differences. Motorized components within the weapon additionally allow for moving the positions of the internal barrels, allowing for altering the shape of the spread.
- All weapons also suffer from heating and instability in the weapons own lattice due to cycling hyperweave, which can result in harm to the user or the weapon destroying itself in the process of operation. Cooling systems are thus built in to account for this, and accelerator weapons typically demand pacing in their use, a final tradeoff in exchange for their greater damage over their ballistic counterparts.
- While some believe the 'rifle' classification of hyperweave-reliant weaponry is unfounded as the barrels are not rifled due to not being made for ballistics, the classification stuck as weapon apertures used in nearly all weapons 'spun' hyperweave on firing to stabilize it. With many deciding that the aperture was fundamentally a barrel component, and it induced spin on whatever was leaving the barrel, it could be said that, technically, accelerator weaponry had rifled barrels, and thus were fit to be called rifles.

**Focus/Beam Rifles**
- A weapon system that functions by firing a constant, honed stream of hyperweave, made possible with constraint apertures that contain the wild bolts to a single, condensed beam.
- Because of the fact forming and firing hyperweave is a function that consumes a massive amount of chalk even with the highest efficiency tier of entropic weft compressors, certain compromises must be made depending on the minimum threshold of power required for the task at hand.
- This class of 'weapons' sees far more usage in the industrial space, as a means of cutting ultra-hard materials or fusing similar. This is due to the calcic supply for these devices often needing to be massive, and thus necessarily stationary.
- They can still be used on the battlefield nonetheless, though charge remains an issue. However, the destructive power of a beam of hyperweave is nothing to scoff at, and with disposable hyperweave batteries they are able to saw through armored ground vehicles and cripple starships. 

**Rocket Delivery Platforms**
- A broad term describing all manners of self-propelled shell-firing weapons, ranging from rocket launchers, to multi-shot rocket launchers to special ordnance deployment weapons such as for tracking-enabled weapons.

**Further Notes**
- Regarding ammunition; Striders typically weave ammunition as needed, meaning reloading is often a case of removing a magazine, weaving rounds into it, then returning the magazine to resume firing. Skilled Striders are able to fold equations into their rounds, bestowing them with additional properties such as better range, explosive payloads, caedometricity or more esoteric properties such as the ability to rebound, incendiary or cryogenic properties, homing capabilities, corrosivity - virtually anything a Strider can conceive, up to binding rituals into rounds themselves.
- That being said, Striders still carry some amount of ammunition to account for combat in regions with low latent chalk, regional equations suppressing calcic powers, or their own fatigue caused by **unravelling** in extended combat. 
- Far more **esoteric** weapons exist in the Switchboard, and while some may fit in the categories above, just as many break the mold, and are deserving of entire categories of their own. Instead, they are categorized simply as 'Esoteric' followed by the weapon they most resemble, such as 'Esoteric Marksman Rifle'.

#### Martial Weapons
Classed according to their weight and edge, the martial weapons of the Switchboard remain ever relevant as the premier means of doing battle in close quarters. Proficiency with martial weapons is essential for all who wish to traverse the Switchboard, as their simpler natures and lack of reliance on ammunition allow them to cover for some of the weaknesses of firearm-class weapons. Additionally, martial weapons are far more suited to weaving and casting. 

Using the Grid, we can classify an ensemble of weapons according to weight and edge as mentioned earlier.

|             | High Edge (Pierce)              | Medium Edge (Slash)                                | Low Edge (Bludgeon)                                         |
|--------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Heavyweight  | Glaives                         | Scythe (War)<br/>'**Great**' Swords<br/>Halberds       | Warhammers                                                  |
| Mediumweight | Spears/Lances<br/>'**Thin**' Swords | '**Long**' Swords<br/>'**Curved**' Swords<br/>Axes (Battle) | Quarterstaffs<br/>Clubs/Batons<br/>Maces/Flails |
| Lightweight  | Daggers                         | 'Paired Arms'<br/>Felkrams/Felkraves                          | 'Glove' Weapons                                              |

##### Elaboration
**On Weight**
- Weight somewhat correlates with both the effective range and damage of the weapon. 

**Sword Subclasses**
- Swords in the Switchboard occupy four subclasses; **long**, **thin**, **curved** and **great**.
- **Long**swords are a **one and two-handed** sword subclass defined by **straight edges of which both are sharp** and evoking what comes to mind when 'sword' is mentioned. Under here do you find European-style **longswords**, **arming** swords, '**bastard**' swords - and as a more 'exotic' pick - the '**ninjato**', so placed due to its straight edge, though possessing only one.
	>In narrative practice, the 'longsword' simply describes the simplistic, familiar longsword, capable of one and two-handed wielding. To avoid using a term with very distinct cultural origin, the 'ninjato' is replaced with the '**straight**sword', describing a longsword-style weapon with no guard and only one sharp edge.
- **Thin**swords are a **one-handed** sword subclass defined by being **lightweight** and **far more suited to piercing attacks**, though some do possess edges capable of slashing attacks. Under here do we find picks such as the **epee**, a thin, almost wire-like sword lacking in edge but possessing plenty of point; the **sabre**, a weapon suited for fencing, differing from the epee in being more rigid and possessing a slashing edge; the **rapier** being a sort of upscaled sabre more suited for non-sports combat, further differentiated due to its ornate hilt; and the **estoc**, just about bordering on the longsword class with its high slashing potential and cruciform hilt construction.
	>Due to the immense similarity across the weapon classes in thinswords, some modification is made in the literal meanings of weapon names; '**saber**' is used to describe a rigid blade lacking in edge, only capable of piercing attacks, and '**rapier**' describes what the estoc is, though maintaining the ornate design of the hilt implicit in the name. 
- **Curved Swords** are a **one and two-handed** weapon class defined by **single-edge**, **curved blade** weapons. Under here do we find a variety of weapons from different cultures, such as the **katana**, **khopesh** and **cutlass**, possessing of **high slashing power** but **considerably lessened piercing power** compared to their longsword cousins. 
	>Due to their also culturally distinct names, in the Switchboard they are all consolidated and denoted as '**curveswords**', '**recurve swords**', '**recurve blades**' or '**recurves**', describing the nature of their blades to bend backwards. Differences in construction are specific to individual narrative instances of a weapon and mentioned when necessary.
- **Great Swords** describe an exclusively two-handed weapon class defined by immense size. They posses nearly zero utility as piercing weapons, better suited for wide, sweeping slash attacks against colossal targets, almost like axes. Under this category do we find our **claymores**, **zweihänders** and **flamberges**. This category sees very little usage in the Switchboard, except in particularly fringe cases.  

**Spears/Lances** 
- This class would normally possess a considerable amount of overlap with Glaives and Halberds, except that they are separated from them by virtue of being **throwable**.
- Striders wielding spears and lances by necessity have some means to return the weapon to their hands, either by some weave technique that allows for projecting a rope or chain that the weapon is bound to, or inculcating a ritual that recalls the weapon back to the hand upon fulfilling a trigger.

'**Paired Arms**'
- This describes a category of weapons that usually come and are wielded in pairs.
- Here do we find weapons such as 'kama', short swords and sais.
- They are not particular loved by fighters in the Switchboard who make extensive use of calcic abilities as they don't leave a hand free for weaving. 

**'Glove' Weapons**
- A weapon class of weapons that fit closely around the hands, such as knuckle dusters or 'brass knuckles', though some additional variants exist under this category such as studded gloves.
- Very favored by calcic ability-heavy Switchboard fighters, as they leave the hands free for casting. Often, they are paired with a dagger.

**Felkrams/Felkraves**
- A somewhat newer class of weapons, developed by the Fel-Arcad for elaborate displays of martial arts prowess, more ceremonial and theatrical than combative.
- Felkrams follow a core design philosophy of being dual-bladed pole-arm mockeries. The first felkrams could be viewed as single-edged scimitar-style weapons, merged at the hilts in opposing directions, such that the sharp edges faced opposite directions.
- As such, depending on size, they can be wielded in different manners. The original felkrams were made to have one pair of blades carried in both hands, granting the wielder four blades total. Their younger brother **felkraves** are designated such due to their arising later, and not accounting for their typically larger size, having being made of often full-size swords.
- The actual usage of felkrams requires considerable acrobatics, balance and spinning of the weapon as opposed to slashes and thrusts, and this has earned them a reputation for being some of the hardest weapons to use and master in the Dancirah, able to be mastered - perhaps - only be the Fel-Arcad who's almost post-scarcity living conditions allows for studying and practicing one thing for procession after procession.
- In ceremonies they are frequently in the hands of Fel-Arcad heroes, and covered in scarfs and the like that twirl and spin as the felkrams are wielded.
- In battle, they are used for high-mobility, rapidly dispatching targets, though their prowess in dueling can't be understated as most don't know how to even counter them. The Fel-Arcad keep few secrets, but the felkram is one of them.
- Felkraves bear additional power as a **caster-class** weapon, and allows potent ritualism to be woven into them, both empowering the weapon itself and being triggered by the involved steps in its usage.
- Elaborating on the point above, felkraves are designed to have their constituent blades **split** during operation, giving the wielder a more traditional two-blade option. Alternating between dual-wielding blades form and the felkrave form can trigger inbuilt ritualism, as well as provide additional combat versatility.

**Further Notes**
- **Caster-Class Weapons** refer to weapons that due to their tactility, interactivity, and the generally highly involved nature of their operation, serve as excellent bases for calcic abilities. The numerous unique actions performed in their operation allows for deep ritual-crafting, with each action able to be tied to a function baked into a ritual that transforms the weapon into an artificial relic. **Handcannons**, **combat bows** and **marksman rifles** are the preferred caster weapons, and they are frequently seen in the hands of powerful Striders.
- Many martial weapons are well suited as **caster-class** weapons, finding themselves as able to be used in combat as means to cast calcic abilities. Differing from the requirement of involved operation and interactivity in firearms, caster-class martial weapons are made so by how they can be used to 'channel' chalk. In this do we see **glaives**, **halberds** and **quarterstaffs** seeing utility in casting, as their straight length (and to be pretty damn honest, resemblance to staffs) allows for channeling and disseminating calcic power. After them, **longswords** and **thinswords** see proficiency in calcic ability fighting styles as well, due to their ability to be wielded in one hand, leaving the other free for casting. **Thinswords** in particular are popular among ritualists as their pointed ends are very suited for [[The Hands as Chalk#Weave Mechanics|Point Propagation]] of chalk ribbon. 
- **Curveswords** and **greatswords** are better suited for **dispelling** rituals and chalk abilities due to their enhanced edges and therefore **caedometric** potentials. **Thinswords** also have the ability to dispel calcic abilities, but require immensely precise strikes at exact locations in cast. As mentioned above, they are particularly favored by ritualists. 
- Blunt weapons in the Switchboard are somewhat of a rarity among chalk-wielding fighters, as the nature of lattice and weave makes it so most persons who fight *with* weave are kitted to fight *against* it as well. Weavers, more simply put, are geared to fight other Weavers, and thus prefer weapons that slash and pierce. Blunt weapons however, are something of a wildcard, as the **breaching damage** they inflict is very capable of smashing weave, and blunt weapons often find themselves in the hand of Vahnkin and other wielders of the Void, who are perhaps even more suited for fighting Weavers than they are.
- Some **Flash Protocol: Weave Overclock** utilizations allow for weaving a calcic analogue of a martial weapon and using it to fight, or a Supercharge utilization that uses a weapon as part of a cast. A Weave Overclock can have a Strider weave twin axes and do battle with them, or their Supercharge ability could be throwing a woven lance at a target that explodes into spikes or fire or whatever else a Strider may choose.

#### Super-Class Esoteric Arms
In addition to the various weapons wielded by denizens of the Switchboard, there is an additional class of weapons - **Esoteric Arms** - wielded by the individual super-classes. These are weapons with a fair bit of history behind them, and are designed to synergize maximally with the superclass they are tied to. Super-class Esoteric Arms are found most commonly in the hands of those who have reached the pinnacle of execution of their chosen combat schools. Necessarily, they are also immensely powerful, difficult to create and even harder to wield to their utmost potential.

##### Chalkweavers: Praxlances
Necessity indeed is the mother of invention and at the intersection of the unique necessities of the Switchboard and that of Striders, and the means of addressing those necessities, spawns a hybrid martial-firearm weapon that is frequently found in the hands of the highest echelons of Chalkstriders and Weavers. These are the lancerifle and the praxlance.

Answering the question of 'what if we put a gun in a melee weapon?', the lancerifle was formed. Consisting of a marksman or sniper rifle built into the shaft of a glaive or halberd, the lancerifle was purpose built for Academy Operators as a weapon to address the needs of the greatest challenges of the Switchboard, as well as the powers of those most suited to face them. Primarily, their power lies in their dual-purpose function and their utility as caster-class weapons, adding a sort of third, final ability as weapons for advanced chalk weaving and calcic casting.

Speaking on their construction and operation, the lancerifle was built almost entirely out of metal, the handle of the polearm hollowed out to function as the barrel for the precision firearm built inside. They were magazine fed, taking custom built, high caliber offerings, and possessed either bolt-action or semi-automatic operation. As polearms, they took primarily the shape of halberds, possessing two to three distinct 'business ends'; a concave axe head for cleaving attached to the side of the polearm handle, a long 'apical spike' at the end of the shaft, resembling a spearhead, utilized for piercing attacks, and a 'beak' opposing the axe head, a dagger-like blade that saw much use in certain fighting styles that made use of return swings after an initial swing. Two-blade configurations omitted the beak. The shaft typically had two major gripping points, one being a pistol grip mounted perpendicular to the polearm shafted, housing the trigger. The second point was a section wrapped in simple material such as leather or plastic to prevent having to grip raw metal. A third point along the shaft was a projection of material also perpendicular to the shaft, that was braced against the shoulder and served as a stock for recoil mitigation. 

In operation, two major kinds of lancerifle existed, based on the end that the projectile from the in-built firearm fired from. The first iterations had the gun barrel terminate at the butt of the polearm, such that a melee fighter aiming to deploy the gun would have to flip the weapon around, point it at their target, and then shoot. Later developments used a clockwork mechanism that allowed the various blades of the polearm section to 'fold' and be tucked away, revealing the rifle barrel, allowing firing out of the same end that bore the blade components. While this was obviously more popular due to being less cumbersome to utilize in combat, it presented additional problems implicit to complexity, such as more points of failure, additional fragility, and being harder to repair.

That being said, the lancerifle was a success, made particularly so by the Academy only providing them to distinguished operators, and the creation of the '**MOD-XXX-LR**' fork of the Modular Offensive Division's artificial ritual, specifically designed for calcic lancerifle applications.

>As a digression, a new school of thought formed in the martial-firearm hybrid weapon school of study - this school being defined by seeking to replace the precision weapons that lancerifles were built with... with shotguns or other pellet firing weapons instead. Their argument was that the destructiveness of a shotgun in the range where a polearm was used outmatched that of a precision round, and that the original philosophy of a weapon that was a polearm until you suddenly needed to engage a distant target was a poor one. They argued that instead of creating a weapon 100% effective in melee range and ~80% or so effective at marksman weapon ranges, they should instead craft a tool that would dominate melee range, and leave marksman workloads to marksman weapons. They garnered considerable support among manufacturers and Striders alike, and alongside the lancerifle, many 'shotlances' or 'spreadlances' were developed, to considerable success. 

Further innovation upon the lancerifle however, inevitably led to the abandonment of the usage of driven ballistics entirely. The Precision Accelerator Rifle or the '**Praxxel Rifle**' was seen as the next logical step for integration into a polearm, and the **praxlance** was born. Using accelerated particles - turning it into an 'energy' weapon - instead of traditional ballistics created a weapon that was far more accurate, just as effective (if not more so) in the ranges where lancerifles were typically deployed, able to utilize different firing patterns based on on-the-fly configurability of its internal enginery, and most importantly, resulted in massively improved destructive power. 

The main operating difference in praxlances was a novel approach to firing, in which the blades of the polearm were used to emit the hyper-accelerated particles, allowing the polearm to discharge shaped 'blasts' of concentrated energy. The apical spike atop the polearm was used for typical firing applications; pointing it at a target, charging and firing could discharge a hyper-compressed, immensely accurate bolt of energy able to travel long distances and rip through armor and targets alike. The axe head saw a massive upgrade in its destructive potential due to the ability to have a charged 'package' of energy ready, discharged right after the axe cleaves into a target, adding a 'phantom' second swing to every attack. In a sense, it became an 'energy melee weapon', and while it was absolutely capable of engaging at distances suited for a precision rifle weapon, Striders found overwhelmingly more utility in their ability to add glowing-hot destructive energy to their every melee swing.

Their construction is all metal, alloy, fiber and calcic enhancement. In their shaft is the particle accelerating components as well as the enginery and onboard computing necessary for control of discharge and firing patterns. The shaft is built of ultra-tough alloy with shock-dampening properties, preventing the rattling of the sensitive internal components. Preserving the three-blade configuration of their lancerifle ancestors, many add a fourth blade at the butt of the weapon - a 'nadirical spike' if you will - that saw usage in return swing or 'weapon spinning' fighting styles, or most commonly, as a means to anchor the weapon - standing upright - into the ground, something that saw use in ritual casting and other calcic applications.

And it is in its calcic potential that the praxlance truly solidifies itself as the final Strider weapon. From its shape as a staff to the litany of 'steps' in its operation, praxlance-modified MOD rituals contain a litany of actuation points for aspects of the ritual to 'hook' on to, allowing Striders to engage calcic abilities and actions on almost every action taken in the operation of the praxlance. Spooling the accelerator, pulling the triggers, spins, swings, thrusts, cleaves - all can have steps in a ritual bound to them, such that the praxlance exists almost in a state of **endless chalkweaving**. It can be rooted in the ground and used to prepare a much larger cast with it as the focal point. It can enhance a Strider's 'handweaving' of woven charges and other implements. With the MOD ritual it can synergize with Teks, modified on a per-user basis. It can receive massive empowerments through the Flash Protocol. Striders even weave connections between it and their Slate if it is outfitted for combat, and use the onboard computational power to further accentuate the praxlance's capabilities. 

Most of the praxlance's 'weaknesses' are mainly the fact that few but the absolute best of Striders can utilize it to its full potential. The problem of weight of the weapon, heat from its internal enginery, and more problems that would have plagued a conventional imagining of it are solved by the MOD equation baked into it as a matter of necessity. Even in contexts where calcic ability usage is suppressed, the martial aspects of its construction and the inbuilt praxxel weapon systems function entirely without calcic input.

It is, by all metrics, a Strider superweapon. 

##### Depthstriders: Gravity Axles
When regions collapse, their regional equations are usually the last to resolve, ceasing their calculus and collapsing in upon themselves. The result is an ultra-dense, immensely complex core of woven chalk known as a [[The Skywards Pursuit#The Gravity Axle|Gravity Axle]]. This immensely rare construct is valued by various parties for various reasons; Psychitects covet it as it an essential component for creating regions, chalk Ritualists desire merely flakes of it for casting powerful rituals all the way to the structural cast tier. Flakes of it are built into relic weapons to grant them immense power.

But those who desire it the most - and perhaps have the most ready access to them - are the Vahnkin dwelling in the Challenger Dark.

Regions or leftovers from a region's collapse can get caught in powerful flux storms, resulting in their being dragged to the depths of the Challenger Dark. Crossing the Challenger Horizon sees a majority of the their calcic mass become stardrip, and fall to the Amaranth Seas below. Some powerful objects with considerable calcic mass and complexity survive, and one such thing as this is the Gravity Axle. Instead it is tainted by the stardrip, and as it dwells in the Challenger Dark, the taint of the stardrip permeates through it more deeply, until its structure transmutes into a crystalline alloy of chalk and depthstone.

This resulting core of crystal alloy is peculiar in that it induces persistent passive curvature around it, concentrated at both ends. Where it is more calcic in structure, it induces curvature, and anti-curvature at the opposite end where depthstone is concentrated. 

It thus sees major usage as an immensely powerful Depthstrider weapon, in particular due to what can be accomplished with the 'pull' on opposite ends of the Axle. Because they are opposing forces, much of the destructive application of the Gravity Axle comes from **spinning** it. Left to wind up, it can reach absolutely incredible speeds and deliver criminally crushing blows against a target. 

Taken further, it can be used to create **flux storms**. Rapid changeovers of resultant spatial fourth-dimensional depth causes considerable localized instability, resulting in a warping of the effective altitude of the Void. The resulting flux storms can turn previously-believed safe ground to just inches above the Challenger Horizon, and while the rapidly changing depth is very useful to Depthstriders who can use their powers with lessened difficulty due to the nearness of the Void, others find themselves far less fortunate as the flux storm begins devouring everything nearby, including latent chalk.

As an actual weapon, it functions much like a quarterstaff, and sees various manners of use in skilled hands. Control of the curvature around it allows it to 'fly', and some Depthstriders fight with it autonomously; that being that instead of wielding the Axle, they puppeteer it from afar to deliver crushing blows after every moment it has to wind up. Others use it more conventionally, swinging it and using the power of curvature to accelerate their swings and deliver heavier blows. The passive curvature induced by it sees Depthstriders requiring less effort to use their curvature reliant powers, as well as when Taking and being Given from the Void.

##### Pale Amarans: Antamaran Felkrivfts
A weapon with a storied history. 

In a time the Antamaran Fel-Arcad had begun to accumulate a fair bit of political muscle among the wider Fel-Arcad, the first talks of seriously finding a means to close the Challenger Horizon and seal the Void for good began. In a move utterly uncharacteristic of the Fel-Arcad, they allowed their worries to take hold of their reason and thus consider an all out elimination of the Challenger Dark, irrespective of all who dwell within it. 

This, naturally, could not be done on a whim, and first a means to possibly close the Horizon had to be found. This led to incursions into the Void by Antamaran Fel, who set up forward bases, outposts and routes between them, generally allowing them to establish a tangible presence in the Void. When the Vahnkin learned of why they were there, and thus their larger plans to eliminate the Void from existence, thereby possibly reducing the calculative load on the Astrolabe and then *possibly* stopping or postponing a second Refrain, open hostilities between the two factions began, destabilizing the general climate of the Void, creating enmity between the Fel-Arcad and the Vahnkin, and generally creating far-reaching social consequences that led to the souring of the relationship between dwellers of the Dancirah and the dwellers in Isalveh.

But before all that, the Antamaran Fel fought in skirmishes across the Challenger Dark against the children of Vahn and the Daughters of the Deep. The Antamaran Fel believed that the secrets of altering the boundary between the Void and the Dancirah lay in the Void itself, and thus they waged overt and covert warfare in the form of open campaigns and clandestine operations, sneaking in through the backdoors to plunder the fiefdoms of the Void Daughters, or storming their walls and castles to take whatever they felt would be useful by force. 

These campaigns weren't without considerable cost and losses however; the Antamaran fought on unfamiliar turf against an unfamiliar enemy, and even with the considerable power chalkweaving granted and the Fel-Arcad's superior technology, it was difficult opposing the numbers and righteous fervor possessed by the children of Vahn, as well as their superior knowledge and experience, not to even begin to talk of the non-kin threats presented by the Void itself.

For these reasons and many others, including dwindling popularity, the apathy emerging from protracted conflict, and the general souring disposition towards their cause - stemming in no small part from their response to most of their actions producing no tangible results and plenty of widespread death and destruction being "Surely the next!" - the Antamaran knew they would need to develop a new strategy; find some magic bullet that would turn tides in their favor. Some device or tactic or power that would nullify all the advantages the Vahnkin possessed. 

No such thing ever came, however, and after drying up all fund and resolve, the Antamaran Fel were pushed back, and then out of the Challenger Dark, leaving only scorched battlegrounds and soured feelings. It was by all metrics, an inarguable loss; a catastrophe of storybook proportions.

But not entirely.

Sensing their relegation to obscurity - or worse, total annihilation - the Antamaran brokered with Spyndl Academy, aiming to tap into their extensive knowledge of both the Void, calcodynamics and weapons development, the former achieved through the Academy's somewhat covert flux diving operations, both to rescue those who had fallen into the Challenger Dark, and the Academy's own study of the Void and Vahnkin in the spirit of due diligence. This weapons development was done covertly to shield the truth of their activities away from the Vahnkin, though many came to speculate that Academy involvement was present once the weapon emerged.

Dubbed the 'Felkrivft', it became the answer to how one might wield the power of both the Sky and Deep, chalk and the Void, polar white and polar black. The ramifications of its creation were so great that many tie it to creation of what would come to be the entire Pale Amaran discipline. While many had dabbled in harnessing both alignments before, it was this final, concerted effort between Spyndl and the Antamaran that broke the final barriers and wrote the first rulebooks on the new discipline.

The weapon in make is classed under the Fel-Arcad's 'felkr weapons'; weapons defined by their dual-bladed assembly and the immense difficulty required to effectively wield them. The first Felkrivfts followed this design language to an extent, before forking off slightly. For one, they were more like polearms, the foundational felkrivfts being dual-bladed scythes, blades at both ends and facing opposing directions, creating an already imposing silhouette for a weapon designed to break boundaries of thought itself. 

It then became a matter of determining what design doctrines would become the baseline; felkrivfts inherited their older brother's - the felkrave - ability to spilt into individual weapons, the dual-scythe becoming a pair of *kama*. Taking inspiration from the equipment used by flux divers, chains were integrated into the assembly, vastly changing how the weapon was built, looked, and functioned. For a while, a number of designs resembled *kurisigama*, deviating entirely from the polearm design to have scythe blades on chains with heavy weights at the end. This design was particularly favored by the Spyndl Academy, and in fact they armed many of their flux divers and depthstriders with it, dubbing it the 'Spyndl Felkr', 'chain felkr' or the '**Chandlkr**' (PHldr.). It did not satisfy the Antamaran Fel, however, who saw it as too great a deviation from the design of the existing Felkr weapons. 

The solution to this was, incredibly, a compromise. The felkrivft that the Antamaran finally accepted as a workable base design was a three-segment-staff design, each segment joined to the other by a short but extensible length of chain. The two farthest ends would typically have blades, often a long scythe blade, though some models had more axe-like blades and others had weights at an end. But the true power of the weapon was its dynamic reach, made possible by the chain within and it's more esoteric construction choices, particularly materials-wise.

At the core of the felkrivft's construction and what facilitates its additional abilities is pale amaranthite, a stable crystalline alloy of pure chalk and amaranthite, manifesting as purple glass inlaid with streaks of white and black. When pale amara is integrated into a design, it attunes its functionality with both chalk and the depths, allowing it to act as a conduit and staging ground for constructive interactions between aspects of both, instead of destructive 'cancelling out'. In a sense, it is a catalyst for reactions that were possible between aspects of the Void and the depths, but required conditions that were too specific to naturally occur. Pale amara bridges this gap.

In the physical make of the felkrivft, made possible by pale amara, is a constant rift to the opposing plane of where the felkrivft is currently present. Should it be in the Dancirah, the felkrivft's internal rift will be a gateway to Isalveh, and vice versa. In this rift are stored additional components of the felkrivfts construction, most particularly its chain. By using curvature manipulation also made possible by the pale amara in the construction, the felkrivft can extend and retract the chain and by proxy its staff sections, allowing for a considerable attack radius, unorthodox offensive and defensive tactics and a number of utility functions that one can deduce from 'having a very long chain on demand', such as binding targets or increased mobility. The rift on some models even allows for dynamic switching of weapon heads, changing blades to weights or one make of blade for another as the situation demands. The additional power of curvature manipulation also makes the weight far more devastating, as it can have its weight preternaturally and disproportionately increased for truly devastating damage.

With those being its polar black powers, its polar white ones allow the felkrivft to be used in chalkweaving and as a caster-class weapon, though this is taken one step further in the form of the horizon ritualism; chalk ritualism that can make use of components native to the Void and thus interact with Void-tied subject matter. This grants it powers in an *expansion* upon the already versatile discipline of chalk ritualism. With the felkrivft being capable of horizon ritualism, it can interface with the wielder's Teks, be subject to Void-inflicted Skews that grant it longer-lasting-though-removable modifications to its functionality, and can even - with some makes - cast the Pale Amaran's powerful Full Spectra techniques, drawing upon both chalk and the depths to perform truly fearsome feats.

And by such, the felkrivft took a hallowed position in the Dancirah's canon. Though it did not arrive on time to save those who desired it from destruction, perhaps that is for the best, as it has been pondered by many whether the Vahnkin of Isalveh would have been able to defeat an enemy infringing on their turf... if that enemy was wielding their own turf against them.

##### Esomechanists: The Teeth of Ryjik
An excerpt from [[Communications and Compute]];
![[Communications and Compute#^b4588e]]

![[Communications and Compute#^fb11c4]]

The Esomechanist superclass suffers - primarily - from a solid foundation upon which to develop and utilize powers. The Chalkweaver and the Depthstrider have chalk and the depths, and the Pale Amaran has both even, but the Esomechanist has none. 

Thus, it is necessary for an aspiring Esomechanist to level the playing field though any means possible. One such means is learning to harness glass, the great equalizer, that which shreds complexity down to tatters. The Teeth of Ryjik are thus a major interest of all who fall under the Esomechanist domain, and though their weapons are scarce, those that come to wield them wield power in the Switchboard few can rival. 

As such, there is no definite 'shape' for the Esomechanist's super-class weapons, merely a boundary that something can grow and fill to become it. Working backwards from this however, has led many to adopt the usage of glass in their weaponry. 

#### Relic Arms & Weapon Abilities
The most powerful weapons in the Switchboard are [[On Weave and Warfare#The Relics of New|relics]]; weapons that have had their mundane properties enhanced as well as new ones conferred upon them through calcic enhancement. While relics can be found naturally in the Switchboard (often encased as the final plunder in Vaults), most wielders of relics crafted them themselves, and this done through the usage of rituals.

The most infamous of these of course being the **Modular Offensives Division**'s ritual, developed under the authority of the Academy's **CARP** - Collaborative Artificial Rituals Project. The continually iterated-upon MOD ritual serves as a powerful, highly configurable baseplate for Striders and Weavers crafting a relic-weapon for themselves. Of particular utility is the ability to create **weapon abilities**.

While weapon abilities are arguably a part of a subject's kit and fighting style, they are far more accurately a component or part of the weapon that bears the ritual that enables their usage. Additionally, being a part of the weapon and not the Strider themselves, they are not bound by certain limitations that abilities tied to or dependent on the Strider are;

- Weapon abilities are 'cast' from the weapon's own **internal chalk reserve**, meaning that if the subject is unable to use calcic abilities, or is unraveled, they are still able to use weapon abilities.
- Subjects can use the weapon abilities in weapons that aren't necessarily theirs. 
- Weapon abilities do not inflict unraveling on the subject using them, meaning they can be cast fairly infinitely. 

Relic weapons have a **Relic Skillset**, which is a series of powers a relic weapon possesses due to the ritualism inculcated in its makeup. These powers can be **offensive**, **defensive** or **utility** powers, with some relics having a **burst** (PHldr.) that can expend a massive amount of chalk to perform a greatly empowered cast.

#### Martial Arts in the Switchboard
There is an art to combat in the Switchboard, and schools for teaching those arts. Merely swinging a weapon will get you nowhere, and thus it is essential that one learns the formal disciplines of combat, as outlined in the [[Martial Disciplines of the Switchboard]].

As a note, a **T0** category of '**Martial Disciplines**' is added to all of the Arsenals outlined under 'The Super Classes', and the Arsenal Cards elaborated upon under 'pNarrat Concept: Character Arsenals'. Proficiency in each discipline is given in three rankings; **Innate**, **Practiced** and **Novice**.

- **Innate**: Perhaps even born with it; a level of proficiency that comes close to those of masters. Even with weaker techniques you keep opponents kissing the floor, and with strong ones you are whirlwind of effective violence.

- **Practiced**: Clearly you've done the homework; caught between the beginning and the end, a level of proficiency is on display here that shows having learned plenty.

- **Novice**: Ah, you've tripped over yourself; newness stinks like dried sweat from old clothes, and perhaps you shouldn't preform these techniques in front of more critical masters, lest you insult them and earn a broken nose for your time.

### Weapons - Choices and Philosophy
Some further notes on Strider Combat, particularly ones that aid in defining the narrative. 

Let us discuss weapon choices in the Switchboard;
![[On Weave and Warfare#^55a30c]]

The nature of anti-lattice warfare makes it such that all categories of weapons in the Switchboard are viable. Granted, a railgun will hurt far more than a compound bow, and in most scenarios a gun will put down a Strider far more reliably than a sword, but the nature of chalk and Strider Combat is that so narrow a perspective of 'what hits harder' in the sense of per-action damage (firing an arrow versus firing a supersonic projectile) is a surefire way to lose an engagement against an even mildly competent weaver. Your railgun is effective right up until the opponent weaves an electromagnetic pulse grenade or deploys a ritual that places a hard limit on the speed of all projectiles in a space. 

The result of this is a series of unofficial 'rules' or guidelines for Strider Combat, as developed by those who win engagements. Generally, more complex weapons have more ways to be countered - more points of failure, as it were - but also require more complex counters. A sword can really only be countered by a shield, for example, with a shield being an immensely simple construct. Weapons further right on the complexity-counters curve will find that they have more counters, but these counters necessarily are as complex as they are. As such, any weapon you use needs to occupy a space on the spectrum that you know you can maintain its viability.

Ultimately, the winner is who ever can reconcile all the variables and compute a path to victory. The winner is often the smarter, more creative combatant, who uses all of their arsenal to cover for their weaknesses and counter an enemy's strengths. Taking a narrow perspective of 'using the most powerful weapon in a weapon vs. weapon' matchup is a surefire way to be killed. 

Generally, Striders choose to fight with a mix of fairly current and past weaponry; Striders carry 'conventional' firearms and then are usually skilled in combat with one martial weapon, or in unarmed combat. Naturally, these implements are granted enhanced potential via calcic modifications such as rituals; ranged weapons shoot truer and don't jam, bladed weapons keep their edge and cut cleaner. Far more advanced modifications come down to individual Striders' choices in how their choice of weapons mesh into how they fight; how weapons mesh with their power to weave, their teks, and additional powers such as titular powers or the Flash Protocol.

The particular fighting style of gun + melee weapon was majorly popularized by the Academy's Operators, who often patrolled with longswords and revolver-style firearms, both granted considerable power by the [[On Weave and Warfare#The Collaborative Artificial Rituals Project (CARP)|Modular Offensives Division's]] ritual schema. Most Operators built their combat styles around these two elements, as the versatility they offered was easily utilized by those creative enough and possessing the manners of thinking and weaving chalk necessary to become Operators. 

As a point on combat weaving, I decided to describe the actual process as it would actually be described in narrative. Weaving a construct generally begins with a 'cat's cradle' of ribbon chalk strung between the fingers, with which the Weaver would then twist and 'knit' the construct they seek together, using various patterns to achieve the desired results. During the process, they work in ribbon that contains the effects they want, such as in the making of woven grenades. Particularly skilled Weavers are able to simply use Linear Dynamism and command chalk to coil and weave itself into what they desire, wherever they need it, a skill that can be performed often with a single hand or even less, something very valuable in a fight. 

If I were to describe the combat in the Switchboard using fairly recognizable terms to those familiar with fantasy fiction, Striders and Chalkweavers can be thought of as 'artificer-spellblade' hybrids.

### Armor in the Switchboard
Passive defense remains an essential in engagements across the Switchboard.

Armor in the Switchboard sees a significant skew in its usage a design philosophy based on the need to be viable against both mundane and calcic threats. As such, novel ideas are applied in the creation and deployment of armor in the Switchboard.

#### Construction
Construction of armor follows very familiar principles in both material and make. Lighter armors use fabrics and membranes, and as the armor gets more effective, it generally uses tough materials such as metals and alloys, and often gets heavier. Expectedly, suits of armor must leave the joints open to allow for freedom of movement.

Where armor differs is how armor is designed to fend off calcic threats. Conventional armor will fend off mundane threats with effectiveness proportional to its makeup and the nature of the incoming attack. To fend off calcic threats however, new techniques must be used.

This is done mainly through the usage of **counterweave**. The logic of counterweave is that calcic phenomena can be spontaneously unraveled if they counter something that opposes the direction of their weave. To give an analogy - or rather a visualization - it is something akin to what can be observed during destructive interference instances in waves. Waves with properties all similar except for direction clash and zero out, resulting in a resultant of nothing. The principle here for counterweave is similar; if chalk is hurled at counterwoven armor, part of its weave is destroyed by the pattern in the armor, thus blunting the effectiveness of the chalk attack.

Of course, it is impossible to develop a suit of armor with counterweave for every kind of calcic attack possible, however, by making 'generalist' counterweave and applying it to expected parts of the armor where that kind of weave-attack is expected to come, one can make a suit of armor fairly effective to various forms of attacks.

For example, a counterweave against fast-moving, piercing attacks can be lain over the head and the joints, as these are areas where such an attack would have the most damage - and expectedly - will be targeted. A counterweave against explosions over the chest protects the part of the body very vulnerable to shock. Making counterweaves for more along the lines of mundane damage forms, phenomena such as energy (in the form of electricity, temperature change, etc.) and applying them intelligently across a suit of armor serves to create armor most effective for wearers in the Switchboard.

It is in the construction of armor do we see armor classes emerge by weight. Most Striders prefer lighter armors as armor adds to the information mass that must be overcome to Stride. Heavier armor designed with all manners of counterweave and other defensive choices built in is worn typically by the Grounded to engage with Striders or other threats.

#### Purpose-Specific Armor
Armor can be further enhanced to accentuate certain actions or abilities the wearer might take or perform. Armor designed to passively accumulate and store chalk, as well as feed it to the wearer is popular among Striders as it eliminates the need to take pauses in combat to accumulate chalk - often more recklessly than is advisable - before returning to the engagement. Armor can also possess its own Five Straits, and such lend the utility of its straits to the wearer, particularly in the form of the computational line that quite literally allows the wearer to calculate faster and more thoroughly, and thus act more accurately.

Some armor is also designed for going to dangerous environments, such as into the depths of the Challenger Dark, but far more commonly on excursions near law stars or into the Vitric Shelf.

Where most of the decision-making regarding purpose-specific armor arises is in discussions of the kind of **damage types** it aims to protect the wearer from. Discussed earlier, the various forms of damage done in the Switchboard such as caedometric, breach, induction and siphon demand different things from the make of armor, and the kind of weaving and counter-weaving necessary to make an armor resistant to one form of damage makes it vulnerable to others. Some forms of damage like **negentropic** and **unravelling** can't even be defended against, and while others like **siphon** do have some methods available, they come at some considerable costs.

As such, while armor can be built for purposes, no armor can realistically cover every possible threat the wearer could encounter, and plenty of weight is levied on the shoulders of the wielder to find the means to make themselves as resistant to threats as possible, both through the decisions made in designing or acquiring armor, as well as their own skills.

#### 'Powered' Armor
Another step taken in armor development is the integration of Slates or chromegraft-adjacent enhancements that grant armor additional computational prowess or abilities of its own. Slate-enabled armor typically goes in the helmet or equivalent, and gives a wearer the ability to break glass almost at the speed of thought. Chromegraft-adjacent mods can turn armor into a battle suit, covered in weaponry and capable of engaging with threats without much need for a Strider's calcic abilities.

### Unravelling
As Striders engage in combat, weaving and unweaving attacks and casts, over the course of protracted battles, certain amounts of inaccuracy in their actions begins to occur and accumulate, particularly as a result of the nature of calcic abilities themselves. As Striders continually fold and unfold chalk in a short period, the accuracy with which these actions are performed begins to drop, and the Strider begins to **unravel**.

Simply put, lattice damage is inflicted by the Strider upon themselves with repeated usage of their abilities. Chalk is woven - expended - and must be replaced to be weave-casted again, and repeated performance of this action under the high-pressure environment of combat can lead to Striders subconsciously 'speed-casting'; being more reckless with their casts to increase outgoing damage per given time. As such, Strider engagements are on a soft 'clock'; there are only so many casts a Strider can use before unravelling sets in.

And once unravelling does set in, further casting runs risk of tearing into the lattice, causing considerable damage that is difficult to repair. Striders at the risk of unravelling must cease using calcic powers or disengage from the fight, while their lattice is given time to unfold and refold itself back perfectly.

### Active Draw Vulnerability
One significant vulnerability in Striders and Weavers is during the moments when they switch from passive to active accumulation of chalk, much like taking in a huge breath to perform a task that will require the oxygen. As Weavers weave chalk and deplete their readily-accessible reserves, they may need to draw chalk from the environment to replenish these reserves and keep fighting.

The risk of this is in how the lattice interacts with incoming attacks. Suppose and attacking chalkweaver fires a calcic attack; a chalk-spun salvo of sharp bolts for example. The default state of the lattice while in combat is to *reject* foreign weave bombarding it, as it almost certainly an attack. This passive change to the lattice raises a Weaver's passive defenses, and reduces the potency of attacks.

Should the attack strike a Weaver while they are actively drawing in chalk, however, it can be likened to flinging an handful of sand into the face of someone taking a large breath, as opposed to one actively bracing for it, hand over their eyes and orifices. Even if the foreign weave isn't designed to do damage in this manner, it is absorbed into the straits where the interpreter line must unspool the weave into chalk before it can be absorbed. The consequence of doing this is two fold; one, unspooling weave is a computational strait process, which wastes compute resources and delays them from getting back into the fight, and can even suspend the maintenance of 'channeled' abilities, such as active rituals or passive shields. Two, it clogs up the interpreter strait. Whereas ordinary unharnessed chalk would glide through and fill the reservoir of the potential strait, the interpreter strait must detangle the weave of an absorbed attack first before it can continue absorbing chalk.

And it is even worse if the attack has inductive, negentropic or unravelling properties to its damage. All of these acting at the strait level as opposed to merely the outside lattice makes them considerably more dangerous. Negentropic sources absorbed into the straits are almost guaranteed to be fatal. Inductive damage can use the targets own computational straits to multiply, spread and retrigger their effects, making them harder to purge. And unravelling damage done directly to the straits can be permanent, leading to a skewing of the functionality of the Five Straits entirely. In rare cases, it can result in a loss of the ability to weave chalk.

### Damage Types
Various kinds of weapons and threats in the Switchboard do damage to both structures and persons within it, and the nature of the Switchboard makes it such that different concepts do different kinds of damages in different ways, just as different things sustain damage in different ways. Quantification of these various damage types is useful to understand how to mitigate them. Damage in the Switchboard is divided into four **superclasses**; true, resource, mathematical/stat and praxis/meta.

#### True Damage
This is damage as we understand it; physical harm inflicted upon the physical makeup of a thing. It is the most common and thus the easiest to inflict, achieved through the usage of weapons and powers, and is often a component in the delivery of other kinds of damage. 

- **Caedometric Damage**
	**Source**: Sharp weaponry. Things that cut and pierce.
	**Mitigation**: Dense weaving, counter-weaving.
	**Shorthand**: Caedo, Cado., C
Caedometric damage in the Switchboard is damage dealt at the ribbon level by things that cut, this being simple blades to Tek-based attacks and calcic rituals designed to emulate cutting to damage lattices. Considering how common sharp and pointy things are, caedometric damage is encountered fairly frequently, and thus the methods to mitigate it are fairly well known. Densely woven targets are harder to cut, and certain powers of counter-weave sees cuts do far less damage by cutting alongside the 'grain' instead of against it.

- **Breach Damage**
	**Source**: Blunt weaponry. Things that bludgeon, smash and break.
	**Mitigation**: Elastic, 'springy' weave.
	**Shorthand**: Breach, Brch. B
An interesting form of damage in the Switchboard dealt by blunt instruments and weaponry. While cutting and piercing weapons are vastly preferred in the Switchboard due to the nature of chalk ribbon, and the utility present in even weak bladed weapons in their ability to cut weave, breach damage inflicting weapons still have a place, in that they 'breach' various forms of defenses, calcic or otherwise, and are particularly effective against complex, densely woven weave, treating it instead as a solid, tightly-wound singular mass and then shattering it to pieces. Bypassing armor by crushing it, breach damage stands as a wildcard to most Striders and Weavers, who typically only prepare defenses against caedometric damage sources. Vahnkin and other wielders of the void are fond of breach-inflicting implements, heightening their crushing power with their power over gravity.

- **Induction/Inductive Damage**
	**Source**: Various phenomena.
	**Mitigation**: Specific to individual subtypes, general protection against offensive weave.
	**Shorthand**: Induc, I
Inductive damage is done by **inductive weave**; weave phenomena that propagates in subject by inducing themselves on contact. When something is set on fire in the switchboard, for example, temperature is induced in it, and this invasive weave causes damage to the subject lattice. Attacks that cause damage over time such as poisons, burns and bleeds work by inducing continual damage to weave, while effects like stuns, blinds, freezes and paralysis continually re-manifest themselves in a targets lattice, inflicting their effects on a victim.

#### Resource Damage
Damage that is inflicted against 'resources', or more simply put, the ability to use certain powers. Chalk and the calcic in particular are vulnerable to resource damage forms, either through physical, numerical depletion of the chalk available for use, or damage inflicted on a system to prevent its usage.

- **Unravelling**
	**Source**: Weavers as they use weaving abilities, various abilities and phenomena in the Switchboard.
	**Mitigation**: Avoiding weave.
	**Shorthand**: Unrav, U
Unravelling is inflicted by causing a lattice to undo itself, pattern spontaneously resolving back into ribbon. This is most commonly a self-inflicted form of damage, done by chalkweavers as they weave abilities - particularly in combat. Combat-weaving needs to be done fast, and thus can be done carelessly, and as a Weaver weaves chalk into various casts and abilities, it is possible that they weave the looser, fraying ends of their lattice into them as well. Pulling at these fraying cords damages the Weaver's own lattice, and if not provided time without any weaving to allow the lattice to repair, it is possible to 'unravel' oneself, and for a Weaver to become merely a discordant pile of chalk ribbon.

Some abilities in the Switchboard also inflict unravelling against targets, either by creating more of these frayed ends on contact or pulling at ones already present. These are of considerable concern to Weavers, as it is a direct attack upon their ability to fight an enemy. Heavily unraveled targets sustain damage to their **potential** and **interface** Five Straits, resulting in an ability to accumulate and weave chalk. Forcing through this causes considerable harm, possibly leading up the the total unravelling mentioned earlier.

- **Siphon Damage**
	**Source**: The Void and void-based weapons, abilities and phenomena.
	**Mitigation**: Counter-depth shielding, large chalk reservoirs.
	**Shorthand**: Siph, S
A specific kind of damage dealt by the Void and attacks drawing upon it and using it as their basis for attack. Void attacks against calcic lattices siphon chalk away from them, inducing depth, which empowers Void weapons to siphon away more chalk, thus granting Void weapons a sort of vampirism. This presents a tangible threat to the many calcic entities in the Switchboard, particularly weavers who use it for their casts. Mitigating this siphon effect is difficult, as Void weapons and powers even do so passively, and thus Weavers and others who depend on chalk are incentivized to get rid of void-wielding targets as quickly as possible, lest all their available chalk reserves and chalk in the vicinity be dried up.

#### Mathematical/Stat Damage
A far more esoteric damage type that attacks something deeper; innate mechanics upon which many other systems hinge. Mathematical damage is so called as it attacks at the ribbon and equation level, damaging calcic enginery to cause cascading effects throughout a system. Glass in particular is notorious for this, inflicting havoc on those unlucky enough to be subject to it. Computational is fairly new but distinctly deadly, in that it can attack the Five Straits directly and curtail various essential functions.

- **Negentropic Damage**
	**Source**: Glass and some calcic abilites.
	**Mitigation**: Anti-vitric protections, such as the blessings of Skydancer Ryjik.
	**Shorthand**: Neg, N 
Negentropic damage is done primarily by Glass, though its effects can be somewhat replicated by some calcic techniques - as an example, rituals that use Glass as a component. Negentropic damage describes an irreversible reduction of the target's complexity, this being catastrophic to calcic systems as complex weaves of chalk are reduced down to meaningless ribbon, then converted further into Glass, material devoid of entropy. 

- **Computational/Tech Damage**
	**Source**: Slates majorly, and other digital weaponry.
	**Mitigation**: Cyberwarfare protections, lattice protections.
	**Shorthand**: Comp, T
Damage that is done to a subject's **computational** Five Strait, inhibiting their ability to process and calculate. Damage to this line interferes with various calcic abilities, such as casting rituals, using Teks and performing complex weaves, as well as inhibits mental functions. Typically, this damage is inflicted by Chromelings controlled by Vault Minds, or Slates designed to attack the lattices of Striders in the vicinity, due to Slates' own ability to manipulate chalk. 

#### Praxis/Meta Damage
> Further reading can be found discussing [[The Blank-Slate Mind#The Praxis Protocol |the Praxis Protocol]] under the Blank-Slate Mind. 

A form of damage that transcends the Switchboard's normal functioning, operating instead at the level where doctrine meets doctrine. Praxis damage done is inflicted not just against a target, but on the entirety of what they represent - quite literally an attack on their core principles which rebounds to others who share those principles. Praxis powers can oppose mundane ones by design; a praxis sword can never be blocked, and a praxis shield can never be pierced, except if opposed by other praxis phenomena. 

Praxis damage is dealt and received constantly, occurring at minute and imperceptible levels as adherents of any principle prove the strength and veracity of one principle over the other. Only on rare occasions can praxis coalesce and swirl, coming to bear as a something levied against someone or something in the Switchboard. These moments reverberate through the Great Sky, and inscribe themselves into the history books for all time to come.

- **Praxis/Doctrinal Damage**
	**Source**: Praxis attacks, events upon computation by the Astrolabe
	**Mitigation**: Feats, doctrinal differential.
	**Shorthand**: Prax, P
Praxis damage is strange in the Switchboard, as praxis damage dealt or received is a result of doctrinal clashes, and manifests majorly but fairly imperceptibly as a fluctuation of invisible scales. These scales however, have tangible results in that the represent the strength of the Switchboard's various doctrines in relation to one another, and the actions of all who hold a doctrine alter the balance of the scales.

Praxis damage is thus dealt by a holder of one doctrine against a holder or another, and this results in a tipping of the scales in the attacker's favor relative to the sufferer of the blow. The tipping of a doctrine affects all who hold that doctrine, and while to individuals it manifests as an ultimately minute loss in raw strength, it does have tangible effect of doctrine-dependent abilities as well as the operation of that doctrine within the Switchboard and all that hinges upon it. Praxis damage dealt against the doctrine of an institution, for example, is a tangible weakening of that institution, in a manner that sees their actions less effective and their goals made harder to achieve.

### Combat Grafts
> It is required that you have read [[On Birthing and Being#On Shape |The Lattice as a Canvas ]] before this.

Striders may choose to get various grafts installed on their person that grant combat abilities, particularly in the case of chrome-based grafts. These grafts somewhat interface with a Strider's calcic powers, but generally they must be designed to do so. In some cases, the **Flash Protocol: Flashcharge** can be used to supercharge a graft. 

### Strider Combat in Practice
A section to talk about Strider combat in practice; less so the mere listing of everything that contributes to a Strider's arsenal and rather how these components are utilized in actual combat engagements.

The Strider's arsenal can somewhat be grouped into martial weaponry, ranged weaponry, and calcic abilities - which then means that the skills a Strider needs to cultivate to be effective in combat are melee fighting, marksmanship and weaving/casting. Development of these skills is as imaginable; practice and study.

Enemy classes are broadly classifiable into two; humanoid and non-humanoid. Humanoid foes are most commonly other Striders, Weavers, Grounded and some more esoterica. Non-humanoid foes are described in [[The EPIT]]. A better way to classify might be along the lines of intelligence; thinker-fighters like other Striders are dangerous in ways that demand careful approach, but true proficiency in combat comes from approaching all combat in this manner; as a series of complex puzzles that must be solved, a set of locks for which there are many keys.

In which we then talk about how do Striders learn to fight. The sheer diversity of threats in the Switchboard means it is reasonably impossible to equip any one subject for every single one. A more rational approach is taken; teaching and training to use all the components of their arsenal as effectively as possible - to hit hard, shoot straight and weave true under pressure - and then provide information available on certain common targets, but most of all teaching *adaptability*. The difference in efficacy between two relatively equally equipped Striders comes down to who can respond best and fastest to dynamically changing challenges tabled before them. It is why versatility is so important; you can prepare for a lot of it, but not all of it, and you must be able to cover for what you can't prepare for with what you can do in a given moment to steer an engagement to success.

As such, experience goes a long way. Frequent sojourners face more, and if they survive, learn more. As they survive, they get better at doing it, as experimentation continually yields rewards in the form of strategies and weaponry to be deployed against future examples of the same combat engagement. It raises the question of whether Strider Combat at its highest levels can be taught, and the answer to that is somewhat split; you can teach methods of fighting high-level Striders, but not how to fight *every* high-level Strider. 

Speaking more on the combat practice, the nature of the Theory of Damage means that weapons and weave that sufficiently damage a target will eventually be able to fell it. Combat is a damage race; use all methods available to you to defeat a target, either by death, incapacitation or forcing surrender. Skillful application of these methods will counteract the same methods being applied against you. Victory is found at the intersection. 

### Vehicular Combat
While the title implies that it covers a wide range of combat engagements involving vehicles, it more specifically talks about inter-regional combat in **jumpships** performed by Strider-pilots against targets within the Great Sky.

Most commonly, Kache Krashing operations require approaching the Vault in jumpships and softening up the defense before the Krashers can be inserted and begin the process of cracking the Glasswall. The local space around Vaults are often crawling with Mind-controlled robot sentries known as 'Chromelings' that swiftly engage invading targets and aim to destroy them. They are opposed by jumpships and other 'space' craft, using all manners of mundane and calcic weaponry built into their hulls. 

Inter-regional combat requires a completely different skill-set, namely that of the fighter pilot, who must treat their craft as an extension of themselves, practicing deft dodging and weaving between enemy fire, positioning, deployment of weapons, and more. 

### Power Progression
Power Progression by Striders in particular is a fairly linear path walked from simpler, less specialized combat methods to complex, powerful and unique ones that form a part of a Strider's overall combat 'style'. Progression along this line is done through cultivation of skill, acquisition of knowledge, and tangible, physical rewards for pursuits and adventuring through the Switchboard.

Newborn Striders begin with only their Strider and Weave Protocols. The Weave Protocol grants elementary means of attack and defense, and the Strider Protocol remains the premier method of escape from overly dangerous engagements. The Weave Strike is the first weave power learned by subjects in this category, and further offensive ability is obtained through acquiring a mundane weapon. Having a solid doctrine - and thus doctrinal power -  grants an edge over those at your tier, as there is so little differentiation in methods that often mere raw strength can cover for calcic insufficiency. 

Practice and instruction in the Weave Protocol translates to acquisition of the remaining weave powers - the charge, shield, dash and woven weapon - and the woven weapon in particular is a considerable jump in offensive capability, as chalk-augmented weapons are far more effective than mundane ones.

The next major leaps in strength comes in deliberate pursuit of certain schools of practice in the Switchboard. Striders and Weavers with proficiency in the Weave Protocol can immediately begin their study and practice of rituals, providing a rapid acceleration of their 'power level' as they gain access to the swathe of abilities presented by rituals. For exclusive Chalkweavers, this is typically where their power progression ends.

Striders on the other hand have the ability to launch out into the Switchboard and gain more power in the form of tangible boons reaped from exploration. Striders in the Academy are granted access to the **MOD** ritual schema, transforming their mundane weapons into formidable calcic implements - artificial relics - capable of considerable damage. Exploration of the Switchboard's Wellsprings can yield a Strider's first **Tek**, a defining element of a Strider's gradually cultivated fighting style. Striders learn quis - quickcasts - around this time as well out of necessity due to the nature of their preoccupations, especially if they serve the Academy. Ritual schema are plundered from the Great Sky's bounty as well.

The acquisition of weave powers, relic weapons, Tek, quis, rituals and additional odds and ends obtained from exploration and plundering the Great Sky allows for a Strider to begin crafting a unique **fighting style** by which they will be known to other denizens of the Switchboard. This particular step attained on the progression ladder is a significant one, as a Strider outfitted in such a manner is more than ready to take on most challenges that exist in the Switchboard.

But of course, further progression is possible through deeper exploration. Striders that have obtained a distinct fighting style are often ready to begin Kache Krashing operations into the Switchboard's Vaults, where they can retrieve all manners of boons that serve as direct upgrades to their preexisting powers. 

Drinking of the ancient chalk in Vaults much like drinking of the chalk of wellsprings serves to 'age' or mature a Strider's lattice, empowering their weave powers. Esoteric Teks modify existing Teks a Strider possesses, serving as either buffs, side-grades or even complete overhauls to how the Tek functions. Vaults may contain relic weapons or other artifacts - natural relics with spontaneously evolved equations baked with them, which can boast unparalleled power and often demand a revision to a Strider's fighting style to accommodate them. Ritual schema are a common content of Vaults as well, granting Striders new quis and rituals to cast alongside their more in-built powers.

As the Strider grows more skilled and powerful, they may be able to utilize a second Tek - even a third - and modify any or all with multiple esoteric Teks. But true command over the Weave and the Strider Protocols is displayed using the Flash Protocol. Just as the pyramid narrows significantly moving from Weavers to Striders, it narrows even further going from Striders incapable of using the Flash to Striders who can. Flash Protocols define Striders, and crown their fighting styles with completion. 

From here on out, the only way a Strider can become more power via things they acquire rather than develop is through prime relics and titles. Prime relics are so incalculably rare as to be nearly impossible to actively pursue, and titles are obtained through continuous practice and earning repute across the Switchboard. Prime relics in particular push Striders into all-new heights of strength, and often after acquiring one do they obtain a title. Striders at this tier are immortalized in the tapestry of the Switchboard.

#### Further Notes
The progression ladder can also be imagined as having other, smaller ladders running parallel to it. Various other means of obtaining strength exist, ranging from Striders who obtain chromegrafts to grant mechanical augments to their powers, and Striders who obtain powerful slates and become Glassbreakers capable of speaking to and controlling machines - to Depthstriders who forego chalk entirely and seek power from the Amaranth, granting the ability to be Given and to Take from the Void, empower weapons with anti-calcic properties, and perfect fighting styles revolving around altering the local curvature of space to manipulate gravity. Each of these paths - parallel ladders - can be pursued to considerable ends of their own, and those who sit at the highest in each of them are nothing to be scoffed at.

Because above all else, knowledge an experience can go a distance that no blade, bullet or weave can. Even more important than having a diverse and powerful kit is knowing how to most effectively wield it, and that isn't something that can be taught in most cases. The real most powerful members of the Switchboard are those who have made jaunt after jaunt and obtained victory after victory and have sustained - but survived - numerous failures, because of **what they have seen**. Veteran Striders, absolute paragons of Striders, are seen using arguably simpler kits because they have cultivated fighting styles in which they can always reach their win condition. Their power comes from versatility and adaptability that comes from **openness** in their fighting style designed. Knowledge of a vast swathe of threats naturally allows them to design their fighting style to be prepared for as many as possible, and that is how they appear to the uninitiated as outrightly undefeatable.  

### Epiphanic Breakthroughs
Combat in the Switchboard takes many forms, but irrespective of context and form, there are common lines that can drawn through every instance of it. That is the factor of '**stress**'. Combat is highly intense, taxing, fast and dynamic. It demands - greedily - all that its participants have to offer, taking it all and then some. All of the faculties available to a subject are stretched to their very limits, and while this may not be a comfortable experience for the individual, it does create interesting conditions for certain phenomena under information dynamics to occur.

As denizens of the Switchboard dwell within it, they grow and mature, both they and their straits. As one engages in combat, it compels the straits to function in manners demanded by the subject's combat methodology, and in time they grow accustomed to the subject. In time they can perform the various techniques with greater proficiency, and this proficiency only grows with time and utilization, reaching a **cap** that is decided by various amorphous mechanics ranging from the subject's own general proficiency to the nature of the technique in question. To surpass this cap on evolution, something must be introduced into the straits that causes them to formulate new theorems that in turn create new methodology.

And the perfect time for this 'something' to be introduced into the straits is often the stressful context of combat. Reminiscent of the environments that caused the evolution of intelligence from mindless chalk substrate to begin with, the Five Straits find themselves in the furnace of survival, and must either devise a means to survive, or see themselves be destroyed. They must function in some new way, using old methods skewed slightly. It in these circumstances that a 'something' can be introduced.

This 'something' is always information, where it is gleaned from being the true question. From something in the mind and brought to the forefront without explanation, from something tried in the heat of battle that paid off more than was expected, from something an opponent is able to do, dropped into the straits from the Current; it can come from nearly anywhere. And once it is introduced into the furnace where the straits broil wickedly, an **epiphany** is obtained, and should the straits grasp it, even just a little, it is possible for the evolutionary cap on a technique to be utterly shattered, a subject going through multiple seasons or even processions of otherwise slow growth in mere moments.

This manifests - mid battle - as the power to use a new power, deployed as though it had been known and practiced for ages. And with this, it can be enough to turn the tide of battle. 

### Arsenal Classification & Terminologies
The culmination of all gear, abilities, casts and powers possessed by a subject in the Switchboard is their **arsenal**. Elaborated upon more fully in the Super-Classes section above, in this section we take a look at the arsenal classifications for the superclasses as well as relevant terminologies that aid in describing and understanding what is mean by the Switchboard's various forms of power.

**Gear**: The lowest 'tier' of arsenal classifications, and describes the **majorly physical weaponry** wielded by actors in the Switchboard. While some gear-_reliant_ powers are also in this category, it refers to the tangible weaponry themselves.

| Chalkweavers | Depthstriders                                                 | Pale Amarans |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| T1           | T1                                                            | T1           |
|              | T3 <br/>- Gifts from the Void<br/>- Possessions from the Void |              |
|              | T5<br/>- Shaped Arms                                          |

**Abilities**: The defining characteristic of an ability is that it must be something that can be performed **innately**. It refers to all of the powers that an actor in the Switchboard possesses usually by virtue of their bodily composition, such as possessing the Five Straits and the Weave Protocol, an attunement to the depths, or pale amara implantations. These abilities are combined with physical prowess in their execution, and are an actors basest level powers.

As an example, weave strikes, charges and shields are **woven abilities**, so called as they are woven into being using chalk and the innate power of the Weave Protocol. Depthstriders' ability to **manipulate curvature** is a result of their ability to fabricate **negative information** and thus induce fourth-dimensional depth and altitude. Pale Amaran's reconcile elements of both using the **polarity** provided by pale amara integrations into their lattice, allowing for **spectrum weave** and **chaotic curvature manipulation**.

| Chalkweavers | Depthstriders                         | Pale Amarans                                                               |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| T2           | T2                                    | T2/3 (Polar White)                                                         |
| T5           | T5<br/>- Chronodynamism               | T2/3<br/>- Polar Black: Point Collapse<br/>- Polar Black: Point Expulsion) |
|              | T3<br/>- Draw Strike<br/>- Formshift  |

**Casts**: Casts describe a swathe of Switchboard powers defined most simply by a jump in complexity. Differing from abilities but not wholly, casts are often reliant on something external, such as consumable ingredients, existing phenomena, or the acquisition of secondary power sources. Casts may also involve using **abilities** in more advanced ways, and in this category are usually the most powerful powers available to actors in the Switchboard. Rituals, 

For example, **rituals** of both the calcic and horizon variety are 'casted'. Most Tek-granted powers are casts as well, as they are dependent on the Tek to function. Depthstrider's **Deep Hollows** are casts as well, reliant on the conviction of the caster in the Void. For their sheer complexity alone, the **Aura Strikes** and **Full Spectra** abilities are casts as well. Judging by the fact most high-level parts of an actor's arsenal are considered casts, you might conclude the **Flash Protocol** would be a cast as well. Conversely, it is not, as it is reliant on the Strider Protocol - an innate ability - thus making it an ability-level power. Powers granted by **gear** such as Relics and Tools from the Void are considered casts as well.

| Chalkweavers | Depthstriders | Pale Amarans |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| T3           | T4            | T4           |
| T4           |               | T5           |

**Powers**: 'Power' is used fairly loosely in the Samsara canon, used to describe basically any 'thing' that an actor can do that would be filed under the department of 'supernatural' if performed in our world, for example. 'Powers' used more specifically however, refers to power granted by very external systems that are fairly removed from those that benefit from the resultant of that system's enginery. **Praxis powers** are good example of this, hinging on the Switchboard's transcendent interplay of doctrine versus doctrine. **Titular powers** are similar, drawing on the collective power placed behind names and titles that rise to lauded or infamous status in the Dancirah. 

> Something that breaks the mold a little bit are **chromegrafts.** Chromegrafts are not like the Weave Protocol in that cybernetic installations are not innate. That being said, the powers granted by a cybernetic can hardly be considered a cast, as that would be putting, say, a wrist-mounted machine gun at the same tier with grand rituals. For this reason, chromegrafts are treated as **abilities**, as their very tightly-interwoven nature with an actors lattice should allow for consensus that a power granted by a regular arm and a chrome one aren't different enough to warrant a differentiation in category.

### Cross-Arsenal Interplay
The cultivation of a fighting style in the Switchboard requires the accumulation of various forms of power, and their amalgamation into a final, cohesive unit, wieldable by a denizen of the Switchboard. This cohesion may need to be created, and one such way this is done is by seeing what parts of a subject's arsenal can enhance with other parts of it.

A Strider's Tek for example, could be woven into their elementary weave powers, allowing for it to be used in various ways. Rituals can be encased in woven grenades and thrown to increase their effective range and quis can empower the woven abilities to give them powers beyond regular equations. More such interactions exist. It is particularly exhibited in how Weavers use their Teks, as Teks are ultimately abilites that expedite the execution of certain feats which - done through weaving chalk, attempted even - would prove incredibly difficult when not outrightly impossible. 

There is plenty of cross-arsenal interplay seen in how devices like chromegrafts and Slates interact with the rest of the subject's arsenal. 

> As a case study of how Teks are used in an arsenal, we can consider legendary Strider Adven Ventura and his **Trajectory Calculator** Tek, a modification Tek that allows him to draw parabolic slide rules and calculate the path of any freely moving object in space. His Trajectory Calculator allows him to ensure his **Priming Bolt** weave strike always strikes its target. His **Saboteur's Charge** and **Interceptor Flechette** also benefit from the additional accuracy granted to his throwing from calculating their paths, and the Interceptor Flechette in particular is wholly reliant on his Tek to function. His **Projectile Net** knit-shield uses his Tek to calculate where oncoming barrages of projectiles will strike, allowing him to only allocate as much thickness to the knit of his shield as needed, allowing for minimal chalk expenditure and unravel accumulation. Finally, his **Calculated Leap** allows for highly precise repositioning even through dangerous environments.

### TX/T-'Aux' - 'Auxiliary Powers' 
> Add as a subheading under Further Notes

The auxiliary powers are additional powers in an actor's **arsenal card** that are derived from things independent of their own personal lattice. These are primarily **relics**, **chromegrafts**, **Slates** and **Teks**. 

All of these are 'added' to a character's arsenal after the fact, and thus have additional ways they are classified and their powers are broken down. **Chromegrafts** due to their very close integration to the local lattice of their bearer can in a sense be considered **abilities**. However, particularly advanced chromegrafts that go beyond conventional implantations can be considered **powers**. Slates are similar, in that they are closely integrated with the lattice of their bearer, and because of their function, are considered **casts**.

Considering that they are sourced from something external, the actions granted by TXs are classed as **powers**.

TX - Relic Action Set
- Offensive
- Defensive
- Utility
- Feat

TX - Chromegraft 
- As An Ability
	- Offensive
	- Defensive
	- Utility

TX - Slate
- Digital Offensive
- Digital Defensive
- Weft Mimicry
- Directive

> Slates are undergoing some revision.

T3 - Teks
- Offensive
- Defensive
- Utility
- Burst

Additionally under this category are the **Praxis Powers**. These are mostly passive powers that stem from the character's association with a particular doctrine. Actively-used Praxis Powers are often under the other categories, which are simply granted a praxis component to how they function. Purely praxis powers are under this category as a result.

- Praxis Powers
	  The result of faith, conviction or association with a doctrine. The bearer reaps doctrine-relevant boons through the collective reservoir of chalk created by all who share their belief in that doctrine. These boons are usually passive 'buffs' that round out an arsenal and add character to the subject in question. 
- Titular Powers
	  The result of evolutions in the doctrine of the self, that sees the arcane mechanics of the Switchboard and the mundane ones of its denizens combine to confer a subject with a title, and empower them by virtue of bearing it.

### pNarrat Concept: Character Arsenals
A distinct character trait of Striders especially in the Switchboard is their desire for and active cultivation of notoriety and infamy. Striders actively pursue a name for themselves through any means possible, and one of the most effective means of doing so is the cultivation of an identity through consistent practice of recognizable, unique quirks. One such thing as this is the cultivation of **signature combat styles** that are unique to a Strider. Infamy is thus cultivated as that Strider fights using their signature techniques and as people see them do so.

The narrative result of this is '**character arsenals**'; the total sum of all the offensive, defensive and utility powers at an actors disposal in the Switchboard. All these things outlined in a singular document - particularly in an individual character's profile, creates an **arsenal card.**

> We have an example of one such arsenal card in the form of [[Fyre_AC]].

#### Example: Adven Ventura (Deprecated)
> Deprecate this; use Fyresworde as a study.

A case study/example outline of a Character Arsenal using Adven Ventura.

**Mundane - Tier 1**
- Martial Arm: **Tritanium Longsword** (MOD Relic Longsword)
- Firearm: **Sojourner's Tale** (MOD Relic Handcannon)
- Tertiary: **Praxlance**
**Notes**
	The Sojourner's Tale is an eight-shot handcannon made to order and refit for unparalleled accuracy. It fires specialized 'keyhole' rounds spun from ribbon by Ventura himself.

**Elementary Calcic - Tier 2**
- Weave Strike: **Priming Bolt**
	  A ranged calcic attack. Chalk is spun into the shape of bolt and flung at a target with high speed and accuracy. On impact, it does critical damage to armor and inflicts a lattice vulnerability to piercing attacks.
- Woven Charges: 
	- **Saboteur's Charge**
	  A grenade is woven from chalk. It resembles a small cube that can be thrown from the hand or attached to surfaces, where it lies in wait for targets. On detonation, it violently unweaves into sound and light, deploys a slowing field that affects all targets within and a electrical pulse that targets weapons with onboard computational systems, slates and chromegrafts.
	  - **Interceptor Flechette**
	A grenade is woven and tossed, resembling a small sphere that can be thrown from the hand. When the fuse expires, it uses Ventura's Tek to calculate the path of various projectiles moving within its blast radius. Upon detonation, it fires out a swarm of flechette projectiles that intercept them, knocking them off course.
- Knit-Shield: **Projectile Net**
	  A field projected from an outstretched hand. This shield ability manifests as a net of chalk ribbon that arrests the momentum of any projectiles fired at it. The momentum stolen from them can be turned into calcic charge.
- Weft Dash: **Calculated Leap**
	Ventura performs a highly calculated jump, simulating all major and minor movements required to move through a space and the exact amount of chalk that must be flared to produce enough velocity to perform it, and land at an exact position. This leap takes into consideration all possible obstacles to his flight using his Trajectory Calculator, allowing him to leap through swarms of moving projectiles (such as hailstorm of bullets) without issue.
- Woven Armament: **Stabilizer Lattice**
	When Ventura wields a firearm, weave keeps it firmly in his grip, transferring firing control and recoil compensation to his entire body rather than solely his arm. This allows for making immensely accurate shots, and doing so repeatedly with very little accuracy loss over time.

**Advanced Calcic - Tier 3**
- Tek: **Trajectory Calculator**
	  A passive **modification** Tek that grants the ability to lock on to, track and calculate the path and strike location of any projectile in motion. Deploying an invisible graduated lattice creates a three-dimensional spatial ruler that allows for calculating and thus predicting the path of a projectile. If Ventura aims his pistol, he is able to predict where the shot will land. If he sees an incoming projectile, he is able to intercept it with a shot of his own. It sees its true power in its ability to calculate **rebounds**; in addition to calculating where a projectile will strike, he can also calculate the trajectory the projectile will take when it ricochets. This allows Ventura to - rather uncannily - bank shots off surfaces to shoot at targets around corners.
- Qui: **Hardpoint Calcic Rounds**
	  Ventura summons a qui-wheel, feeds it (ritual components) and eight rounds of ammunition for his handcannon, transforming them into hardpoint calcic rounds. These shots rebound off targets irrespective of the hardness of the struck surface, and can do so a number of times. Due to their hard tips, they can also pierce targets, and can continue on their path, rebound and strike the same target again. Hardpoints do considerably more damage to targets that have piercing vulnerabilities inflicted upon them. 
- Qui: **Unravelling Rounds**
	  Ventura summons a qui-wheel, feeds it (ritual components) and eight rounds of ammunition for his handcannon, transforming them into unravelling rounds. These rounds inflict an amount of chaos to the lattices of Striders and Weavers, inflicting unravelling upon them, but not doing much by way of physical damage. These rounds are used more to sabotage an enemy combatant, or as a way to suppress a target for capture.

**Ultimate Calcic - Tier 4**
- Flash Protocol: **Ricochet Barrage**
	  Ventura weaves eight hardpoints, then flashcharges the Sojourner's Tale handcannon, his Tek, and all eight hardpoint rounds. The flashcharge rapidly accelerates the matter of the rounds, turning them into partially energy ammunition (as is fired from Axxel weaponry), granted them a massively increased ability to pierce. Flashcharging his handcannon allows it to fire with unrivalled accuracy, as well as confers additional muzzle velocity on the accelerated hardpoints. Flashcharging his Tek allows him to calculate many, many rebounds deep for multiple projectiles. Ventura - within the space of a fraction of a second - then calculates and fires all eight rounds, such that they fly, strike, pierce and ricochet of any number of surfaces, flying, striking and piercing the target again and again, until they are shredded to pieces by gunfire.
- Signature Ritual: **Safe Passage**
	  Ventura draws a chalk circle and performs a ritual, expending an amount of components. All within the effective range of the ritual have their effective information mass lowered, allowing them to stride further and carry more cargo. 

**Auxiliary Powers**
- Doctrinal Power (Tier 3): **Doctrine of Strength**
	  A passive ability granted to Ventura due to his unwavering confidence in the power of strength. Attacks he makes against targets weaker than him do more damage, and calcic dividends are extracted from them to fuel his own abilities. Additionally, even when critically unraveled, Ventura is still able to accumulate chalk and empower his base weapons with it.
- Doctrinal Power (Tier 1): **The Sil'khan**
	  Ventura's pride in his Sil'khan roots empowers him. When fighting away from home, Ventura's abilities are empowered. When fighting on new frontiers, in Vaults or in different planes, Ventura is further empowered. 
- Titular Power (Tier 3): **The Strider Sojourner**
	  Ventura's notoriety earned by virtue of his ability to seemingly traverse the Switchboard under any conditions has empowered his Strider Protocol. Ventura is able to passively accumulate chalk mid-stride, and can no longer fall into the Void. This passive chalk accumulation allows for extending the distances he can stride, as well as replace momentum lost due to travel.
