# EPIT: The Ever-Present Intelligent Threats
The treachery of the Switchboard is many-fold; from the lattice-sundering Law Stars to the will-breaking Vaults to the gaping maw of the Void, living and traversing in the Switchboard is defined by risk and danger. A common thread to all these however, is that they are not dangers that think, they simply are. Law Stars do not scorn a Strider's lattice out of spite, but rather because that is simply their nature. However, out of necessity, the Switchboard is also filled with thinking - intelligent - threats. Threats with goals, even if they are simply satisfying a rumbling in the belly.

As exists in various other works of fiction, the world is simply necessarily populated that things that are smart enough to realize that killing you poses some advantage to them, and the Switchboard is no different. The Ever Present Intelligent Threat is a classification for the Switchboard's fauna - natural or otherwise - driven by an explicable - or not - apparent hatred for its denizens. 

The subdivisions under the EPIT are that of origin; the Vitric Shelf, Great Sky and Challenger Dark all have intelligent dangers native to them, shaped by their individual environments into creatures of varying kinds and levels of danger to denizens of the Switchboard. For simplicity and narrative relevance, we will only be discussing the creatures that are hostile even without provocation.

**Rough**
- Challenger Dark
	- A separate category for the beasts of the Amaranth
	- A category for creatures unique to the ChalDark
	- A category for creatures which are just other creatures that have fallen into the Challenger Dark and have imbibed its nature, becoming more terrible as a result

## Workshop: EPIT Enemy Modifiers
Modifiers for the base enemy classes, refer to the sheet for more details;
![[WN-DT#The Samsara Grid-sheet]]

## Methodology: The Grid
![[WN-DT#The Grid]]

Development of the EPITs for the Switchboard then, is fairly simple. We will define two axes of parameters that will make the rows and column of the Grid, and then at their intersection will be the individual kinds of EPIT. The parameters I've chosen are;

- Creature Quality (wings, tail, claws, armor, poison)
- Creature Class (grunt, soldier, elite, flying, technical, boss)



## The Switchboard's Threats
### The Mindspun
The Mindspun are [[The Lattice as a Canvas#Emergent Minds|Emergent Minds]] born from chalk and taking on vessels with which to interact with the wider Switchboard. While 'Mindspun' is an umbrella term for various forms of elementary, primal thinking chalk, the 'Mindspun' as it is most commonly used refers to a category of Switchboard fauna often violent to dwellers in the Switchboard, possessing abilities that are somewhat psychic in practice.

Taking the form of their vessel, they are thus capable of adopting nearly any form they so choose, functioning almost as 'ghosts' in their ability to possess inanimate objects, bestowing them with animation and manipulating them as they so choose. They are theorized to be the precursors to the highly intelligent and specialized '[[The Skywards Pursuit#^54f43b|vault minds]]' that serve as the sentinels guarding the vaults of the Switchboard.

Mindspun in nature prefer to inhabit artificial/manmade objects whenever possible, but are often resigned to forming elementary constructs out of natural materials such as rocks, trees, vegetation and cadavers of dead creatures. When manmade objects are available, Mindspun are observed to form golem-like constructs out of building materials, and possess vehicles, equipment and - most worryingly - weapons. Collectives of Mindspun (known as a 'host') may develop an elementary desire to cooperate, and can possess large constructs such as entire buildings, transforming them into highly destructive automata should they also find weapons available or devise elementary ones of their own.

Offensively, they possess two major powers; Five Strait disruption and a poltergeist-like ability to fling things. The latter ability is heavily dependent and augmented by the vessel they inhabit, but particularly ardent, developed Mindspun are able to control objects not necessarily a part of their body, in an ability resembling telekinesis. Analyzing the lattice of an object such as a piece of machinery allows Mindspun to learn how to use it, meaning Mindspun can obtain and utilize weaponry to concerning effect. Their Five Strait disruption abilities takes the form of a 'mental attack' dubbed the 'shriek'. Best put, it is a primal expression of wrath that targets the still fairly elementary constituent principles upon which Striders are built. This disruption ability particularly interferes with the interface line of the Five Strait, suppressing the usage of calcic abilities by those in its effective range.

Defeating the Mindspun can be done one of two major ways; completely destroying their body with overwhelming force, such that the shock prevents it from finding a new one, or killing the Mindspun itself with calcic and other methods. Concerning calcic methods, Mindspun are particularly vulnerable to 'Overwrite', and as such usage of calcic abilities against 'free' (lacking a vessel) Mindspun is an effective means of destroying them. 

	It goes without saying that Glass is an immensely effective way to dispose of the Mindspun, due to their nature as calcic existences. 

**Narrative Bits**
- The Mindspun can also be controlled. Finding a means to either reason with their elementary thinking faculties, or subverting their will entirely grants a chalkweaver power over sentient entities they can direct to do their bidding. 

### Chromelings (PHldr.)
Also populating the Switchboard are robotic, semi-autonomous constructs known as the chromelings. All originate from the Switchboard's vaults, manufactured by the Vault Minds for usage in a litany of applications, such as defense of the Vault's insides, the Vault's perimeter, reconnaissance operations, maintenance of the DevitNet and inter-Vault communication. While some Chromelings, due to damage and other factors have gone rogue and operate free from the active command of a Vault Mind or preprogrammed directives, most are under the command of these Vault Minds, and serve their purposes. Chromelings can be found most commonly within and in the vicinity of a Vault, hovering around the wreckage of destroyed and/or plundered Vaults, surveying regions or the wider Switchboard, at sites with particularly large Anarhiza growths, or in transit between Vaults across the Sky.

Chromelings find their primary purposes in defense, information gathering, repairs and communication, and so are appropriately outfitted to serve these various roles, something that will be expanded upon in exploration of their creature classes.

**Narrative Bits**
- The Vault Minds learned to create and perfect computers by observing the Vermeil, the Second Thinkers of the Switchboard who built an advanced civilization within it and named the Dancirah, all while lacking the Strider and Weave Protocols. Observing their advancements allowed the Vault Minds who thought at near-computational speed to rapidly advance their technology and weaponize it against them, one such way being the creation of the Chromelings; an advanced, autonomous, purpose-built robotic utilitarian and fighting force to do the Vault Mind's bidding. 

- The Third Thinkers, ironically, learned to reverse-engineer the technology employed in Chromelings, and with the knowledge gleaned did they devise their own calcic-augmented computers, as well as the Slate and DevitNet, inventions that would lead to the repeated defeat of the Vault Minds 
 
- The Chromelings frequently maintain important Anarhiza nexuses, usually quantified by sheer size or being placed in such a manner that they are the only connecting line between two large Anarhiza networks (such as the Anarhiza near veils). The Chromelings also try and shutdown network infrastructure used by Chalkstriders, or hijacking their infrastructure to mine useful data from it. This leads to physical turf wars between Striders and Vault Minds for control of the DevitNet, and Striders frequently aim to destroy Vault Minds that prove particularly problematic, while Vault Minds oppose Striders by hacking into their network infrastructure and causing chaos. Often Chromelings are the attack vectors themselves, with swarms of them deploying attacks through Anarhiza roots or using their own form of 'breach protocol' to break into Strider technological assets.

- The doctrinal nature of Kache Krashing operations means that the Switchboard's Vault Minds exist in a state of perpetual war with the Chalkstriders. As such, they frequently communicate with each other - Vault Mind to Vault Mind - using immensely secretive and densely protected Anarhiza networks, or physically moving data via Chromeling drones packed with data banks. This data is usually filled with information gathered from observing regions and Strider outposts, individual Striders, failed Kache Krashing operations, Strider movements, all manners of variables are obtained and stored by individual Vault Minds and spread across the wider network, in a singular Vault Mind initiative known as the 'Collective'(PHldr). In an action that truly espouses the meaning of 'information warfare', Striders are tasked with tracing and destroying these data-moving chromelings, or corrupting their data to give false information to receiving Vault Minds, either to prevent access to the data or to create vulnerabilities in them from having been given false information.

- Krashed Vaults often have a 'black box' mechanism built in; a sort of sub Vault Mind that analyzes post-humous information about the Vault as well as stores data obtained by the Vault Mind before its demise concerning the team of raiders that felled it. Usually this information is kept under 'hyper' encryption, or ferried away by leftover chromelings to other Vaults, passing the information across and preparing them for what might be that same team on their doorstep.  

### The Shattered
The two-way portal-jaws to and from the Vitric Shelf facilitate round trips for creatures unlucky enough to pass through them. Most do not survive the journey, as their calcic natures renders them a natural prey to the mechanics of Glass in the Switchboard. But it is not enough that Glass merely exist in its birth place of the Vitric Shelf - not at all - instead, it is often the case that something slips through from behind the jaws, a perfected iteration of something unknown, kaleidoscopic in makeup and calciphagic in nature. These beings are the Shattered, animated Glass that descends into the Switchboard to feed on the developed lattices of chalkstriders.

Little is known of the Shattered. Their forms are alien, nigh incomprehensible, necessarily engineered by something with an understanding of strangeness, yet still possessing the evident touch of nature in that it selects for only the strongest survivors. Their vitric nature makes them the natural enemy of all things calcic, and their apparent need to feed - seemingly - on chalkstriders' lattices makes them, arguably, their only predator. Guided by unseen doctrine except maybe that of pure destruction, they hunt and kill wielders of chalk wherever they can find them.

Their method of attack is simple; delivery of glass into the calcic subject and letting it do the rest. As such, they are visually defined by endless bristles of dagger-like glass growths on claws, teeth, along the spine, on the body; the Shattered are bristling display pieces of light-diffracting glass, making them appear as deadly amalgamations of lacerating sharp and scintillating rainbow. Those who survive their encounters all agree that there is a cruel beauty in their existence, in being so distinct and yet so simple in ramifications. Their vitric nature also means that opposing them is a gargantuan task, as calcic powers are simply unwoven in their presence. Often, the only way to defeat a Shattered beast is through luck and pure brute force; anatomical studies of the Shattered reveal 'cores' that serve to animate the rest of the entity. Sufficient damage to them, often in the form of kinetic trauma, proves a fairly effective way of dispatching the Shattered.

Shattered fall into two distinct groups; pure Shattered that arose in the Vitric Shelf and descended through the jaws to the Switchboard, and glass-morphed Shattered that were originally other calcic beings that found themselves subjected to a devouring of their lattice by Glass, or passed through the vitric jaws where they are 'perfected' into Shattered and returned to the Switchboard. 

However, this is a fringe occurrence; often, Glass simply leads to death. But occasionally, the lattice of a glass-afflicted creature will resist conversion in the face of the encroaching Glass. With a lattice like triply-wound cord, Glass may be defeated before it can cause overwhelming amounts of damage and reach a critical mass that allows for replicative calciphagy. What often happens in this case though, is that Glass then interacts with chalk in a new manner; 'diffracting' it as though it were light, splitting apart the Five Straits, the calcic being's doctrine, some other chalk principles, splitting them down to flayed ribbon that the being's latent regenerative powers then try and pull back together and heal. But it fails, and so it pulls these diffracted ribbons back together improperly, resulting in corruption and damage, mangled and broken. What once was is now No Longer so. This happens most frequently to Striders.

**Shattered Striders**
Striders who are stricken with glass and survive become Shattered. Glass warps their calcic properties and principles, their lattices torn and diffracted, and upon attempts to stitch them back together, they are permanently changed. Most commonly observed is becoming exaggerated versions of themselves; a rapid acceleration in strength and calcic brutality (coupled with a loss in proficiency), but coupled with a reduction of their doctrine and their way of disseminating it down to a baser, more animalistic iteration of it. They rarely can be reasoned with at this stage, as Glass overcomes their faculties and they gain an insatiable appetite for chalk - often the chalk of their chalkstrider cousins.

Among the Academy in particular, Striders struck with glass are given the title of '**No Longer**' appended to the end of their names, resulting in monikers such as 'Ventura-no-longer, Shattered Sojourner'. The Academy policy on Shattered Striders is simultaneously one that forbids engagement, while also demanding that they are killed on sight. The choice is hence placed in the hands of individual Striders, with no course of action expressly being the incorrect one.

Shattering is of major concern in the Switchboard, as Shattered Striders often retain memories of when they were still whole, and may seek to devour the lattices of people they knew then, beginning often with those they perceive to have wronged them, then going after those with doctrines believed to be contradictory to theirs. Strangely, the Shattered rarely go after those perceived to be allies, friends or loved ones, and often retain faculties functional enough understand they are more than just 'not food', but rather entities to be protected. That being said, Shattered cannot be left to roam unchecked, and the fact that the Shattered do not attack those they see as their own kin is often why those very same kin are often asked to dispose of the Shattered however possible.
