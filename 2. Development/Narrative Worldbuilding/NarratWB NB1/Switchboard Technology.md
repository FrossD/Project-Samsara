# Switchboard Technology
A look into technology in the Switchboard, particularly the level it's at, and the examples of unique technologies that exist within it and the philosophy that guides them.

## Preamble
To begin the drafting of this doc, I needed first to see what categories of technology there were, to then see how each would be affected in the Switchboard. Inquiry led me to narrow down all forms of technology - to an extent - down to five categories;

- Information & Communication Technology
- Electrical & Energy Generation
- Mechanical, Manufacturing & 'Heavy' Technology
- Transportation Technology
- Medical & Pharmacological Technology

Of these, in this doc, I chose to focus on ICT, transport and medical as the ways those would be different in the Switchboard were **immediately apparent to me. Electrical and energy generation, mechanical and manufacturing - narratively they didn't seem to be immediately relevant to the canon, other than for those who are immensely anal about worldbuilding. This is a camp I absolutely occupy of course, but they also fit in the camp where explanations for them would effectively be 'we do this, but with *chalk*', repeated over and over for a hundred different things. 

Is it really of immense relevance how fast moving consumer goods are manufactured in the Switchboard? Or how homes are powered? Or rather, are these questions who's answers are so incredibly farfetched they need thrashing in entire documents? I think not; I think that when needed, they will be explained, but as of now there is little need.

In which we can begin.

## The Piano Design Approach
The Switchboard piano design approach or paradigm, stems from viewing chalk as it would function in a system as a mean of transmitting will or intent from an emanator actor to receiver system, moving from one context to another. Put more simply, the ribbon nature of chalk facilitates the transmission of disruption; the transformation of change in one context to change in another.

It is likened to the functioning of a piano. A hand strikes a key, which engages a series of mechanisms, causing a hammer-like tool to articulate and strike a series of prepared strings, producing a note. A Strider stretches a ribbon of chalk between itself and a system, and 'striking' that ribbon produces disruption that can be interpreted by the system in question.

Most technology (as we understand it in the sense of what the word invokes), makes use of a style of utility ritual known as a **looped ritual**. This is a ritual that upon cast, is self-sustaining, and continually outputs folded chalk product for its entire duration, the product - change - it makes being dependent on parameters dynamically altered by the Strider. Chalk 'machinery' can be imagined like a piano again; striking the keys makes music, but pumping the foot-pedals alters the parameters of that music - pitch, bass, the like. ^bb9d1f

It is possible for a Strider to establish a ritual meant to mirror a jet engine; a loop ritual that folds chalk into thrust, and continually does so with no further input other than chalk it is supplied. To control this engine, however, a Strider establishes a physical loop of Five-Strait chalk between them and the engine, and places a bank of buttons along that loop, as well as a device that interprets the output of those buttons to the arcane engines of the ritual. Striking a button produces a disruption, which travels along the loop similar to cracking a whip, which then enters the interpreter device and is interpreted by the ritual, producing the desired change, such as an increase or decrease in the thrust provided by the engine. The buttons actuate the 'hammer', and it strikes the 'strings' of the ritual. Many strings struck in tandem create the music.

Chalk technology then is very dependent on cross-context communication. Striders do not speak the language of the rituals they cast, neither does the ritual have any means to understand the effect it has on the environment, nor if that effect is one desired by the Strider. As such, the operation of a looped ritual requires apparatus that allows the ritual to return data of its own to the Strider for usage in their own internal calculations. Real-time diagnostics, as it were.

### Design Consequences
The striking of a chalk ribbon is a physical act. Pressing a button quite literally transmits the 'weightiness' of that button press into the amplitude of the disruption sent down the ribbon. Flicking switches, pulling levers, rotating dials, moving a joystick - these are the preferred methods of transmitting disruption down the ribbon to be interpreted by the systems along the loop. As such, Switchboard technology has a very 'cassette futuristic' or 'steampunk' design philosophy; things click when touched, and touching is a physical effort exerted to move an input along an amount of travel. Tactility and muscle memory are insisted upon.

	The casette futurism of Switchboard technology is a very deliberate narrative design choice. As I was studying material for what Switchboard technology would look like, I was entranced by the old and even fairly modern cockpits of military and consumer aircraft and spacecraft in both real life and fiction. Why, in our world of touch-screens and voice activations, have these particular spheres of technology not kept up?

	Further study led me to conclude it was a deliberate choice. Buttons, levers, dials and switches - by their very nature - talk back to us through our skin. I push a button and have supreme confidence that it's pushed. I turn a dial and know, without a doubt - without even needing visual confirmation - where the dial sits on a spectrum. Aircraft, spacecraft, are rife with hard plastic, thick glass, monochrome displays, large, tactile inputs. Things are heavy because they are durable, and they are durable because the jobs and usecases demands it. Space will not respect the wafer thinness of a smartphone display, filled with leaky fluids between its almost silk sheets. Technology must reflect where it will be used.

	There's an insistence on repairability as well. In our current world, consumer electronics are almost impossible to repair, and are often designed that way. Not so under the rugged, hardcore design paradigm of cassette futurism. Button banks, cathode ray tubes, ribbon-cable, big things with replaceable parts big enough to be handles by a toddler with poor motion control. I wanted this to be a design focus as well; not just repair, but modularity, the ability to change things - upgrade them, sidegrade them, whatever is desired - on the fly, on a whim, and with little difficulty.

	I extended this design philosophy to the Switchboard. Striders are primarily explorers. They go to places and places can be dangerous. Their hardware must reflect that. It is something I really explore when we discuss the Slates under SBtech ICT. 

	As a narrative point, 'sci-fi' technology as we understand it - in the sense of touchscreens and holograms and digital assistants with hardlight bodies - does exist in the Switchboard as a natural consequence of innovation and a move towards sleekness and ease, but there is a narrative divide that exists between this newer style of technology and it's clunkier, more hardware-centric predecessor. It's yet another manifestation of the narrative theme of Samsara being old vs. new, reflected also in it's characters, where veteran Striders prefer the old design paradigms, and younger Striders find themselves using the more refined technology they are exposed to.

As mentioned in the preamble, we are only discussing three of the five spheres technology was narrowed down to; ICT, transportation and medical. We will now look at each in depth.

## SBTech: Transportation
### The Strider Protocol & Distance
The Strider protocol facilitates traversing considerably long distances extremely quickly. However, due to the constraint of the [[The Strider Protocol#Before the Stride 3 - Launch Threshold|launch threshold]] - the necessity that the accumulated chalk of a Strider be enough, when flared, to exceed the information mass of all things on their person - the Strider Protocol has two major limitations;

- Because the information mass of a Strider rapidly increases based on the number of things on their person; the Strider Protocol cannot be used to move objects or ferry cargo.
- Because meeting the launch threshold is sufficient enough to accelerate the Strider to a considerable fraction of light-speed - a speed very difficult to decelerate from reasonably - the Strider Protocol cannot be used to go short distances. Further reading can be found under [[The Strider Protocol#Before the Stride 4 - Distance Constraints|distance constraints]].

The Strider Protocol is very much a means for a Strider and their bare essentials that make their person to traverse the Switchboard. As such, the SProt does not make other forms of transportation obsolete.

### The Strider Protocol, Distance and Society
The shortening in effective distance between locales has driven Striders to behave in manners that reflect that. Settlements can and often are set up in regions and at distances that make no logistical sense, as logistics simply isn't a concern. It is also reflective of the isolationist nature of Striders as a whole. A 'city' in the Switchboard is often multiple *actual* cities on the same region, separated by vast distances - these distances often valued for social reasons.

	Often it is simply easier to participate in a society if people who think too differently or are too different from you simply aren't anywhere you could readily see them. 

This willingness to build far from others also has some roots in actual geography, the willingness to put distances between each other further encouraged by the quirks of a region's regional equation. A group of Striders seeking to establish a settlement will always take the effort to select a locale most desirable to them, rather than factor in nearness to other settlements. 

	As an example, New Valkyjria is a region dominated by the Trifold Desert (PHldr); a nearly region-wide expanse of barren ground made of sand, salt and chalk. The Fel-Arcad live closer to the poles, fairly south of them, to obtain water from the melting ice flats closer to the poles. The water provides essential sustenance for their green arcadias and for growing their arcologies. 

#### Types of Transportation - Land
##### 1. Working Title: The Hyperloop
Linking most region-side settlements are advanced train analogues known as 'loops' or the hyperloop. Characterized particularly by the distinct appearance of their infrastructure; that of kilometers of glass tubes suspended above the ground, they move at incredible speed, ferrying people and goods across a region.

	It's the most common form of transport used by the Grounded.

##### 2. Wheeled Vehicles
The most common means of moving within a region-side settlement, containing the typical, recognizable assortment of vehicles ranging from human powered bikes to large, multi-wheeled trucks. The major difference is in design; some of these vehicles are outfitted with engines driven by chalk rituals. 

	Expansion is possible here. Vehicles should differe in *some way* in the Switchboard. Find out how. 

#### Types of Transportation - Air
##### 1. Working Title: The Personal 'Jumpship'
The most popular form of Strider transportation is the personal jumpship. These are chalk-dependent, ritual-powered near-light-speed capable craft designed and built with reliability, personalization, speed and utility in mind, aiming to be a vehicle that serves a multitude of functions for Striders, from a leisurely alternative to Striding to a last resort when Striding is no longer possible. A hauler of cargo as well as a formidable mobile weapons platform, an unmatched bridge between one place and another, as well as a home-away-from-home for Striders on protracted jaunts across the Cradles.

Variance in the design of jumpships is equal to that of the variance between individual Striders themselves, though many stick to some elementary design principles; able to seat two to six passengers, able to carry considerable amounts of cargo, able to navigate the skies of regions as well as the greater Switchboard Sky, outfitted with various offensive and defensive measures and boasting - most of all - a considerable amount of 'aftermarket' modularity and customization. 

Central to their operation is 'ritual engine core' (something that will definitely need a more concise name down the line), taking in and folding chalk to power the ship and all it's components. 

##### 2. Other 'Air' craft
Purpose-built craft serving an array of functions such as people transport, freight, survey and military, characterized by chalk engines and mechanisms. 

	Expansion is capable here, but really some fairly mundane stuff like vehicle classes and the like.

#### Types of Transportation - Sea
	Boats... exist. This section, however, is going to be expanded upon when we get around to the doc that outlines the Challeneger Dark as a location. The analogy used to describe the Challenger Dark is the sea for a reason.

## SBTech: Information & Communication Technology
Distance is frequently both a bane and a non-issue for Striders in the Switchboard. Irrespective of that, communications and computer technology remain an essential element of the Switchboard. We detail the unique way these systems function.

### The Natural Systems
Telecommunications and the internet work primarily due to the existence of electromagnetism. Electromagnetic waves allow information to be transmitted across long distances, mostly unimpeded by obstacles such as unfavorable terrain - the largest roadblock faced by most communication methods that came before it.

The Switchboard - expectedly - functions rather differently. 

Much like the Astrolabe, the means by which Striders communicate over long distances is facilitated by natural, preexisting phenomena in the Switchboard; an invisible, almost intangible 'fabric' over the Switchboard known as the **Vitric Shelf**,and a species of tree that interacts with it in a most peculiar manner, known as the **Anarhiza**. Both working in tandem form the **Dendro-Vitric Network**, or the '**DevitNET**'; a lattice of communication relay structures spanning most of the Switchboard. 

#### The Vitric Shelf
As it stands now, [[The Vitric Shelf]] is a 'realm' lying 'above' the Switchboard, much like the Challenger Dark is one lying 'below' it. It serves two narrative purposes (so far); an explanation of where Glass comes from, and the subject of this section - Switchboard telecommunications. 

#### The Anarhiza
The Vitric Shelf and now the Anarhiza stem from a narrative design vision of the Switchboard to contain a litany of wholly natural features that are creative used by Striders to their own ends. Much like installing a waterwheel on a river flowing powerfully down a mountain, I envision Striders as constantly seeking ways to use their surroundings to their advantage, which plays perfectly in the Strider mantra of exploration; the necessity of finding new 'surroundings' to make use of.

A realization of this is the Anarhiza. Much like the various other horticultural components employed by Striders in their rituals and elsewhere ([[The Voice in Flowers]]), the tree that is the Anarhiza - more properly known as the **Verrphagic Anarhiza** (glass-eating upside-down root) - is unique in it's ability to exist in both the Switchboard and the Vitric Shelf. The tree seemingly originates from the Shelf, as it most peculiarly grows upside down; it's roots stretching skywards into semi-tangible shimmer where it crosses the boundary between the Shelf and the Switchboard - before phasing out of sight and reality totally - while it's branches and leaves grow downwards into the Switchboard, soaking up chalk like sunlight. 

Even more curiously, no individual Anarhiza exists, studies on it concluding that every single 'individual' Anarhiza is merely another branch of a far greater progenitor tree to which all Anarhiza are linked through their roots. That, supposedly, every new tree planted grows its roots into the Shelf and meets a collection of roots already present, which it fuses with, becoming another node on that ancient, endless network, seemingly spanning the entire Switchboard. 

It was also discovered that the leaves of the Anarhiza soak up chalk in the Switchboard to grow. A test found that ribbon chalk fed to it not just maintained its form, but seemingly was passed to its roots, replicated, and spread across the entire root network, and that the ribbon sent through one tree could be retrieved from another. This discovery led to the creation of the **Dendro-Vitric Network**, the Switchboard analogue to our internet.

#### The Dendro-Vitric Network
The Devit, or DevitNet as it's usually contracted to, is a network of Strider-built devices and apparatus that make use of the information-relaying power of the Anarhiza and the Vitric Shelf to pass information across the Switchboard.

Central to all network infrastructure is the Anarhiza and apparatus to interface with it, typically just the interface line of a Five-Strait chalk circle. The branches of the tree are linked to computers and other devices that are desired to be hooked up to the network, ribbon is fed through those branches, going up the length of the tree, into its roots and in to the Vitric Shelf where it is sequenced, replicated and spread over the entire network.

Devices made to be DevitNet compatible require Anarhiza derivatives such as branch cuttings or root fibers to be present in their assembly. This links them to the network and allows them to communicate with other devices.

Though information is sent to the entire DevitNet, encryption systems are in place to ensure senders can control what receivers can read transmitted information. Encryption and decryption is handled by the devices hooked up tot the Anarhiza before the message is sent to the Shelf.

While the Anarhiza does allow communication across the Switchboard, it is more correct to say that it allows communication anywhere the tree is present. Though the tree occurs naturally, occasionally Striders must go to far-flung areas of the Switchboard to plant new ones to link new settlements or establish relay stations, as well as maintain old trees to avoid parts of the network collapsing. 

> The Switchboard's functionally internet-analogue is considerably similar to ours, but for the nontrivial difference that, for the most part, the entirety of the DevitNet is conducted on hardline cable. This hardline cable being the Anarhiza also means that the entirety of the DevitNet's digital space is a mirror of the Dancirah's geographical structure. 
> The DevitNet is thus divided along lines similar to that of the Dancirah's, with cradles existing in the DevitNet that house collections of users. One of the consequences of this is that breaks in the hardline cabling can leave the corresponding geographical locale isolated from the rest of the DevitNet and thus the Switchboard, and cabling that needs to break for this to happen are usually fairly easy to locate through following the physical branch cables until they converge into large central arteries moving titanic amounts of information. 
> Thus, maintenance of the DevitNet is a tireless, unending task, undertaken by coalition forces, primarily Sil'khan and Lancasters - especially when considering the sabotage of DevitNet infrastructure is a common tactic of Vault Minds and unscrupulous parties. 

	In a truly hilarious twist - a juxtaposition if you will - Strider network administrators function more like gardeners than whatever image that title would conventionally invoke in the mind. 

#### The DevitNet Netmasters
The DevitNet's netmasters are those who've assumed net-side control of a sector or more of the DevitNet's colossal intangible real estate.

One of the quirks of the DevitNet is that it is very much constrained regionally due to its reliance on the Anarhiza. To elaborate, much of the DevitNet is a mirror of the physical Dancirah, with distance and location in the Dancirah translating almost 1 to 1 to the DevitNet. Two computers place five feet from each other are five feet apart in a sense in the DevitNet. And many, many computers say, on one region, serve to represent that region's physical presence in the Dancirah, within the DevitNet. 

As such the DevitNet is very split up, as it were, with notable locations such as cities and settlements, constructs such as nexuses and vaults, the like, all represented in the DevitNet as being equidistant from each other in that space as they are top-side. Because of this, locational and regional differences tend to arise between members of one section of the DevitNet and the other. These differences can occasionally devolve into real conflict, and usually the mediators or the instigators of this conflict are the netmasters.

By all metrics, the DevitNet's netmasters are functionally self-appointed, autonomous, and in some cases even absolute, powers. Often they establish themselves through charisma, real-world significance, or by 'right of slaughter', to describe becoming a netmaster at the expense of other netizen's wellbeing. They assume control of regions of the DevitNet and assume a number of responsibilities if they feel so inclined, such as moderating spaces and monitoring what goes through the various data highways. In particular however, netmasters are able to gain control of the various information inlets and outlets for a DevitNet region.

The Anarhiza network is setup in a manner that sees colossal nexuses of gigantic trees extend and branch out in all directions, thinning as they go along. This topology sees the various regions of the DevitNet be leaves on this tree, with only one major inlet and outlet that supplies that handles all throughput. Should a netmaster feel so inclined, they can control what passes through this central inlet, or collapse entirely for various reasons. It is one of the larger flaws of the DevitNet.

Why they may be driven to take such actions is multifarious as with anything, but core among what is observed in most who become netmasters - irrespective of means - is twofold; a nigh radiant eccentricity, and being immensely opinionated on the shape the DevitNet should take. The former drives them to assume the position. The latter compels them to take actions, either as infiltrating assassins or rampaging warlords, who seek to realize their vision of the DevitNet through any means possible.

In the net-space, they come to command a fair bit of power. So much so that it has far-reaching implications well outside the DevitNet, and many of the stories the many large bodies in the Switchboard could tell have many mentions of tangos with the netmasters in their writ.

Statistically, most netmasters are Fel-Arcad. Most arcologies double as anarhiza nexuses, thus allowing large information throughput, and the Fel-Arcad as a people are terribly sheltered and isolated, studious to a fault, and in most cases, simply quite bored. The opportunity to deal with all that in a singular fell swoop appeals to them, considering most are already well attuned to the DevitNet even at very young ages. The fact arcologies and their administration are mandated to protect the Fel-Arcad within also presents a valuable shield to any netmasters who prove particularly incendiary.

#### Maintenance
With the DevitNet being the primary means of long-distance communication in the Switchboard other than a Strider with a knapsack or a jumpship, there is an unwritten imperative that it must be maintained frequently to function optimally. It doesn't help though, that much of the DevitNet's infrastructure is incredibly traceable and accessible, and thus particularly vulnerable to those will ill intent.

The task of maintaining the DevitNet is a combined effort, often between Academy Operators and other paramilitary or simply violence-capable outfits, and the actual maintenance outfit. The latter varies. Most of the DevitNet is lacking in explicit jurisdiction, and as such Lancaster Innovations is primarily responsible to giving a little loving to anarhiza trees that need it. If a nexus is under the control of a netmaster or some other group, they often make their own arrangements for the maintenance and repair of infrastructure. It's not unheard of for 'maintenance outfits' to place listening devices or net-side saboteur tech on networks.

The need for Academy Operators or similar is due to the fact that occasionally, nexuses are hijacked by Vault Mind assets. Autonomous swarms of point-defense chromelings can easily wipe out a non-combat fleet of ships, and so it helps to have assets of one's own who are capable of imparting significant counter-force.

### The Slate
	This one I have cherished. 

The Slate is a Strider creation designed to find paths and forge new ones. In its construction a slab of pure chalk and a computational core are united to produce a device capable of speaking the languages of silicon and weave and bridging the gap between both. The Slate seeks to cover for a Strider's weaknesses and enhance their strengths. It is a digital multitool engineered to be an unparalleled sidearm for a Strider traversing the Switchboard. 

#### Construction
A Slate begins with a slab of crystalline chalk hewn from whatever larger conglomerate of crystal chalk a Strider deems fit, the origin of the slab having considerable effect on the potency of the final product. Typically, the most powerful Slates are made from slabs hewn from ancient Wellsprings, deep in their cores where some of the oldest chalk can be found, chalk that has soaked up the patterns of the entire Switchboard and matured over time. It is cut and prepared for a variety of components that will be installed to it, care being taken not to crack or shatter the slab.

The second essential component of a slate is the computational core. Developed by the Academy, these cores are artificial relics engineered to tackle both digital and weave-reliant tasks, baked in with powerful software tools. The foremost of these software tools is its operating system; the **FRONTIER Subsystems Command Matrix**, or **FRONTIER-SCM**, engineered to power Slates and responsible for coordinating their various functions. The computational core is inlaid into the chalk slab, and its vast software mind is opened to the even vaster world of the Switchboard.

The third essential component is a cutting from the Anarhiza, which facilitates the Slate's ability to communicate with other Slates and devices in the Switchboard through the DevitNet. The tree cutting feeds on ambient chalk and its branches weave into the slab, allowing it to be fed ribbon and receive it, allowing transfer of information. It is set typically in a cylindrical recess for it, cut into the Slate. 

More details on the construction of the Slate are given in a later section.

#### Functionality
The Slate serves as a Strider's sidearm on their jaunts across the Switchboard. A Strider will typically carry a relic-weapon, wield a Tek, know rituals and posses some additional powers granted by knowledge or other implements on their person. The Slate seeks to complete this - rounding out the Strider's kit - by functioning as a tool with unmatched utility. 

At its most mundane, a Slate is a computer and computers solve problems. Communication, data storage, retrieval and processing, productivity tasks and even entertainment, it helps to think of the Slate as occupying the intersection of a smartphone, laptop, supercomputer and purpose-built computers (such as the guidance computer for a smart missile system). Serving an array of purposes, the Slate is designed to be a digital Swiss-army knife; a tackler of tasks of immense shape and size. 

> As a result of the Slate's three major components in its construction, it is able to interact with chalk and the local lattice through the creation of an **artificial Five Straits** within it. This enables them to almost replicate an actual Chalkweaver in the Switchboard.

The Slate's true power emerges when used to interact with Chalk and the Switchboard. At its most elementary, for example, it can analyze a set of figures given by measuring instruments and from it, produce a viable Striding path from any two given locations in the Switchboard. Taken further, it is capable of '**deep-weave analysis**', allowing it to scan and produce information about nearly *anything* in the Switchboard - regions, relics, Teks, rituals, ongoing Structural Casts and equations, other Striders - anything. It serves as an artificial upgrade to a user's [[The Hands as Chalk#Weavesight|Weavesight]]. It can run the complex calculations a Strider may need in their chalk-weaving, and simulate fold operations to anticipate the result. It can interface with chalk rituals, serving as the interpreter for ongoing loop rituals as well as provide insight on modification and development of countermeasures, working alongside databases of information on the subject. 

In it's final form, the Slate is capable of use as a weapon, which will be elaborated upon later. 

The power of the Slate lies in bridging the chalk and the digital. It can create certainty where it was previously thought impossible. It can wrench patterns from arcane engines and charts from amorphous clouds of principles. It pulls hard numbers and gives exact information, plumbed from the murky depths of chalk complexities. While plenty of its functions can be handled by a Strider working mentally, the Slate is capable of doing that mental heavy-lifting so a Strider is free to do other things. It reduces the 'grunt-work' of appeasing Chalk's demands for use, allowing the Strider to focus on how to use the power that appeasement grants. 

#### Further Notes on Construction
Slates are the perfected manifestation of the cassette-futurism design philosophy embodied by the Switchboard's technology. They are built with portability and durability in mind, taking on an industrial, almost militaristic silhouette. Ease of repair, tactility, modularity - these things are essentials of a Slate's design. As such, Slates appear somewhat dated, seemingly a generation or so behind the touchscreen, ultra-slim, voice-activated design paradigms of today. Thick glass, hard plastic, polymers and metals, big, repairable parts; Slates are designed with the knowledge that they'll take a beating and the intention that they survive it.

Beginning with it's chalk-slab back, in size it can reach that of a regularly-sized cutting board, almost an inch thick in its thinnest sections. The FRONTIER-SCM computational core is about the size of a Raspberry Pi and typically hidden from view, as it is set inside the chalk slab. The recess for the Anarhiza cutting is set typically along the shorter side, parallel to it, often close to the very edge - much like a regular radio antenna might be set.

Most of the variation in shape and appearance of a Slate comes in the peripherals installed to complete it's construction and make it available for use. Most - at minimum - are outfitted with a keyboard, display, and tracker controller such as a nib, small ball or full-sized touchpad. Ports take high priority as means to interface with other devices and chalk constructs, often done by running chalk ribbon between it and the subject. It's very common for Striders to fly their personal jumpships by hooking up their Slates to it, which serves as the ship's computer.

Additional components are varied and up to individual Striders. Many Striders outfit theirs with a full suite of navigational tools (those listed under [[The Skywards Pursuit#Wayfinding Apparatus |wayfinding apparatus]]) and have the whole process of calculating Stride routes handled by the Slate. Strider Ritualists outfit theirs for deep ritual analysis. Combat-oriented Striders simulate the powers of their relics and Teks and use those simulations to determine the damage done to a lattice, and how better to maximize it, often installing hard-light projectors on their Slate to project human-sized targets to practice on.

	It's also worth noting how Slates are carried. Slates by design are portable, and are almost always worn on the person, facilitated by belts that allow it to be slung over the shoulder, or kept in a holster at the back or side of the body, or mounted in a quick-release system - such as held in place by a magnetic analogue. 

	Depthstriders with their power from the Void typically store their Slates in a pocket void and retreived whenever needed. Chalkstriders are not so lucky; attempting to do similar would require unfolding a Slate down to ribbon chalk, but the sheer complexity of a Slate means that the equation for folding a Slate back together is so complex as to effectively require the computational power of another slate.

Some radically alter the design and form factor of their Slate to better suit their purposes. Some who use their Slates for combat typically split it into separate modules; relocating the display modules into somewhere more practical, such as a wrist display mounted by straps or a holster, or a HUD display mounted in eye-ware over one or both eyes. 
	
	Some choose to have their Slate integrated into their lattice, their components distributed subdermally and the chalk backboard becoming the Strider's entire lattice.

#### History of Slates
The first Slates were created as a matter of necessity. Engineered by Sixth Skydancer Onuris, the Hammer, they were a response to the Vault's and Nexus' security systems as created by the First Thinkers back in the dawning Third Thinkers' Era. The discovery of the Mind's network hosted in the Vitric Shelf, the Anarhiza and how it facilitated long-distance communication between Minds, and the reverse-engineering of the internals of Chromelings led Striders to develop the first computers, and Slates are the result of integrating command over the calcic with computers.

Slates primarily were weapons. With them, they could breach the local networks maintained by Minds, disabling the shields around their various constructs, their autonomous defenses, and securing entry into the construct itself. Slates facilitated the first - and every subsequent - kache krashing operation, through their ability to breach the **Glasswall**; the phenomena engineered by Minds to isolate their command and control networks away from the wider Anarhiza root network.

Though they saw primarily utility in the conflicts against the Vault Minds then, they found themselves in the hands of anyone who benefitted from powerful, portable computing as well. Striders used them in other applications relating to chalk, navigation and even combat. They gained civilian applications as well, serving as entertainment devices, or as tools in industries.

#### The Breach Protocol
As Striders wielded the Slates, they developed new techniques and methods for contending with Minds and their constructs, as well as digital entities, mechanical constructs, and local calcic reality. In particular, a repertoire of tools was gradually developed to fight the Mind Networks, particular when it came to breaching the various flavors of Glasswall that the Vault Minds deployed to shield themselves and the Vaults from raiding parties of Striders. This ever-evolving toolbelt came to be known as the **Breach Protocol**. 

These tools and methods took on power of their own by passively becoming a doctrine themselves. The most notable of the Breach Protocol repertoires was engineered by Onuris, The Hammer himself; the **'PRISMpick'**, a chalk construct deployable over a network bridge to breach Glasswalls through directed effusions of chalk.

#### FRONTIER-SCM
The FRONTIER Subsystems Command Matrix is the software backbone of the Slate's computational core, designed, maintained and improved upon by the Academy. It is the spearhead of the Slate's ability to bridge Chalk and the digital. Originally, it was a software meant solely for navigation and cartography; coordinating apparatus and running calculations with variables obtained from measuring instruments - but it expanded to become a formidable software multitool capable of innumerable calcic and digital functions, particularly so when the utility of Slates in the fight against the Minds became apparent.

##### The Acronym
Taking the first letter of the various functions served by the SCM gives 'FRONTIER', as shown below;

F - Fieldwork
R - Recording
O - Observation
N - Navigation
T - Triangulation
I - Intelligence
E - Establishment
R - Referencing

	There is definitely some fluidity here on what the actual words are. Consult notebook at later date.

## SBTech: Medical
Medicine in the Switchboard works off the mechanics outlined in the Theory of Damage. Ailments in the Switchboard are perversions of a Strider's lattice, thus is follows that healing would be the restoration of the lattice to its proper, ideal state.

### The Theory of Damage
![[On Weave and Warfare#^d2b154]]

More information is available under the [[On Weave and Warfare#The Theory of Damage |Theory of Damage]].

### Healing
Thus all healing in the Switchboard is done through mechanisms that restore the lattice to its intact state. The means by which this is done vary, but isn't particular different from conventional medicine as we understand it. 

![[On Weave and Warfare#^86f483]]

To achieve restoration of the lattice, the same is down but with reverse intent; a means must be found to induce the lattice to refold back into it's proper position, restoring it to its original state, and achieving the status of 'health'.

### Diagnosis
Determining the nature of the ailment is done through analysis of the lattice. This can be done through plain physical analysis such as touch and sight, using devices, or employing rituals. Differing ailments and damage leave identifiable patterns or residue that can be cross-checked with banks of knowledge to ascertain the nature of the damage to the lattice.

	Here's an analogy to aid understanding; the damage done to a wool sweater by it getting caught on brambles differs visibly from the damage done to it by sharp knife, or a hand haphazardly pulling strings out of weave, or a burn left by contact with a hot pressing iron. Striders and their lattices are much like that wool sweater, and someone with experience or a guide can take a glance at the damage and reach a fairly accurate conclusion of the cause. 

### Switchboard Pharmacology
Treatment of ailments in the Switchboard is done typically with derivatives from **calcobotany** - that is, the various flowers found throughout the Switchboard as detailed under [[The Voice in Flowers]]. Striders working as herbalists combine their natures and from it make catalysts that induce the lattice to refold itself back from certain kinds of fold damage. More clearly put, certain combinations of Switchboard flowers are used to reverse the folding of certain kinds of damage folding done to the lattice. 

### Surgery
Occasionally, damage to the lattice requires hands-on repair. Skilled practitioners are able to pry open a Strider's lattice, locate the damage and repair it using various techniques, stitching particularly bad tears in the weave, introducing fresh ribbon chalk where material has 'rotted' or been lost, or clean and prepare frayed, damaged ends for other healing methods to work more effectively. 

Touching a lattice directly isn't without consequence however, as chalk interactions all occur down at the ribbon level. To make contact with another Strider's internal ribbon is to touch them at their very core.

	The implications of this are narrative ones, and will be established when needed.

### Appendum: Physiological Hazards of Traversing the Switchboard
Health hazards presented by traversing through the Switchboard. 

#### 'Ailments', as it were
	This section is incomplete, with more to come.

- **Overwrite**: replacement of the useful information in a Strider's lattice by junk/random chalk, often caused by lattice bombardment by high-intensity chalk sources such as a Law Star. Causes loss of information in the form of memories or weakened abilities. 
- **Depthburn**: violet, burn-like scarring caused by encounters with the Challenger Dark. Prevents the normal operation of the ribbon through those areas.
- **Calcification**: the transmutation of flesh lattice into pure chalk. Common amongst Striders that frequently interact with pure chalk, such as using rituals and drinking from Wellsprings. This isn't necessarily a negative ailment, as under some circumstances it is more desirable to have a lattice made of pure chalk.
- **'Mystic Madness'**: (currently) the result of using the Interpretative Doctrine/Powers to understand the self/things not meant to be understood.
- **Starblight**: Inflicted by repeated exposure to the light of Law Stars, manifesting as immensely pure chalk on the lattice of a Strider, which their Five Straits cannot swiftly assimilate. When accumulated, it wears out the regenerative cycles performed by a Strider's Five Straits and causes a subtle but cumulative reduction in life expectancy.

### Appendum: 'Slow'
Through various means, it is possible for Striders to lose the ability to Stride. This is usually by the corruption or decay of the Strider Protocol. Though it is most known for losing the ability to Stride, becoming 'Slow' leads to the decay of other information abilities.

**Cause**
The most common cause of Slow is age. As Striders take in, manipulate, generate, expel and general immerse themselves in information, bits of the Strider Protocol get partially overwritten with jargon. Its effectiveness begins to decay, beginning with an increase in the launch threshold that must be exceeded to begin Striding, coupled with a reduction in information affinity. Continued use of the Strider Protocol causes further decay, until Striding is nearly impossible or too unsafe to attempt. The life span of a Strider correlates with the integrity of their Strider Protocol. Very active Striders typically live for fifty to seventy years.

Artificially induced Slow is caused mainly by corruption of the Strider Protocol. Exposure to Glass via the Instrument Six is the most common culprit, and more extreme versions of I-6 seize the ability to Stride permanently. Exposure to immense amounts of chalk (such as approaching a Star or accumulating too much Latent Chalk) can overwrite bits or all of the Strider Protocol, much like blasting the paint off a surface with high velocity abrasive powder.

Additionally, esoteric rituals exist that can break the Strider Protocol, as well as Teks and Relics.

**Effects**
In addition to the loss of the ability to Stride, Striders swiftly lose access to other information abilities as well. Their proficiency with using Chalk deteriorates, disallowing them from using rituals effectively. Teks are usually the first to go as this deterioration takes place, followed by the ability to effectively use Relics and [[The Skywards Pursuit#Strider Wayfinding|Strider Wayfinding]] equipment. 

Beyond losing information powers, the corruption and decay of information and equations typically begins producing faults in the Strider's own information, manifesting as more conventional ailments. Chronic fatigue, mental dullness, low response speeds to stimuli, and loss of motor functions are what earned it the name 'Slow', as those afflicted become slow in every sense of the word.

Further deterioration results in the mind reaching a fairly vegetative state. Organ failure happens in a number of cases. Avoiding death requires intensive life support, though most Striders opt for physician-assisted suicide.

**Treatment**
None so far exist.

It is suspected that a ritual can reverse the effects of corruption, but it has not been discovered or developed.

**Perception**
Striders as a whole dread becoming Slow.

The loss of the Strider Protocol in particular is so terrible because of Strider's deification of speed. Speed colors all aspect of Strider life. This is best further explored in [[The Doctrine of Passing]].

In general, the slow are regarded as people who are already dead. Other Striders gradually distance themselves from a Strider known to be close to their demise, as it becomes more and more certain that a Strider afflicted with Slow is unable to keep up and participate in activities carried out by other Striders.

## SBTech: Mechanical, Manufacturing and Heavy Technology
Elaboration on technology relating to materials and manufacturing in the Switchboard, as well as some notes on how chalk affects the production/manufacturing process and materials used in the Switchboard.

### Important Terms
**Metamaterials**
Metamaterials are materials that possess properties not found in 'regular' materials. Typically, they are made from alloying or combining or generally the unifying of various materials into a singular distinct whole so as to utilize the product of their individual properties in one instance, or to use an emergent property that arises by virtue of their combination. As important as their constituent parts is also the shape they take upon deployment, as this can dictate how they interact with various existing phenomena.

In the Switchboard, many metamaterials arise as a product of the influence of chalk and information tangibility upon them. These materials are bestowed with new properties that grant them additional utility to the denizens of the Switchboard.

**Artifact Materials**
These are materials that are manufactured using rituals or similar processes in the Switchboard, and posses highly anomalous properties by virtue of their manufacturing method. Often they are purpose-built for a given use case, and are additionally defined by often exacting and expensive manufacturing procedures. That being said, the utility of a relic material cannot be overstated.

What confers artifact materials with their properties is that rituals inculcate the Five Straits into the material, and the straits can be interfaced with in various ways, allow skilled weavers and ritualists to 'talk to' or program the material to perform as needed.

### The Tiered Materials
Similar to what we observe in [[The Voice in Flowers]], a series of materials exist in the Switchboard on a backbone of 'tiers'. These tiers give a relative idea of the rarity, utility and strength of the given material. While they do see some use in industry, by and large these materials lean more in the 'metamaterials' category, due to their somewhat arcane properties, and this sees them being more used by Striders in the creation of their weapons, armor, tools, as components in rituals, and more.

> While for now we only have metals and metal-adjacent, there is a case to be made to expand the tiered materials of the Switchboard to include biological materials such as wood, and textiles and other materials such as gemstones (crystalline). In more exacting cases we could theory-craft ceramics, polymers, composites, nanomaterials and semiconductors.

#### Tiered Materials: Metals and Alloys
The various metamaterial metals and alloys in the Switchboard are harvested from ores or similar from various locales in the Switchboard. They serve the basis for various weapons, armor, implements, devices, machines and the like in the Switchboard.

**Tier One - Famylar**
A product of the creation of regions via regional equations in the Switchboard, this lime-green ore is seeded deep underground in regions at their formation. Able to be mined and extracted fairly easily, it serves as a sort of alternative to various flavors of regular steel when a material more calcic-attuned is required. It's used in various applications as such, where non-calcic materials will not suffice.

> Tentative, ideally it would be alloyed with silicon to form a silicon-famylar that serves as the basis for various calcic-enabled components in the Switchboard such as Slates, the control boards for Chromelings, and the control boards for various Strider electronics such as jumpships and more mundane purposes in regular computers. Ideally, the advantage presented by famylar is that it bypasses the molecular limitations of silicon by using chalk, enabling it to alter its conductivity calcicaly instead of through doping with other materials, as well as facilitating the usage of a calcic-analogue to transistors. 

Famylar is refined through conventional means of melting and allowing to cool, as impurities are obliterated in the process. A final stage in the refining process, however, is that they are spread out in 'sheets' while hot and allowed to cool under the light of law stars. While not essential, the exposure to fresh chalk aids in its usefulness as a calcic material.

While it can be used in making weapons for Striders, it is relatively weak to shock, and not very good at keeping an edge, and requires the usage of reinforcing weaves or rituals to make it far more suitable as a weapon. That being said, weaves and rituals 'adhere' far more readily to famylar than steel, and as such it sees more usage as a weapon in the hands of those able to make it more viable as one through calcic means.

One final advantage of famylar is its lightness on the doctrinal level, it being many times lighter than equivalent dimensions of steel, while still serving as a suitable alternative to it. The equivalent of 'grades' of steel comes down to how long famylar is allowed to cool in calcic radiance, with longer times spent under radiance resulting in a stronger, but subsequently harder to work with product.

**Tier Two - Calcrysteel**
Our first alloy on the list, made through the combining of various flavors of steel and pure, crystalline chalk as does form in the depths of wellsprings in the Switchboard. Based on the final use case of the calcrysteel, different grades of steel are used, with high-carbon steels finding their ways into calcrysteel and subsequently the most commonly used tier of Strider weapons.

The manufacture of calcrysteel is done with first acquiring high-grade crystal chalk. While mining it in the depths of wellsprings is the most common method, in instances where high quality is desired, crystal chalk is 'crystallized out' of wellspring water drilled from deep within the wellsprings. Upon acquisition of the crystals, they are crushed to immensely fine powder and added to the molten steel of choice, drawn and folded. This drawing and folding inculcates the crystal finely into the mix of steel. The resultant material is metallic, scintillates mildly, and based on the starting steel, has a color that ranges from blue-grey to light blue. 

Calcrysteel's properties are very dependent on the steel used to make it, but the addition of chalk does serve to 'enhance' the properties of the steel present, done by taking in the nature of the steel used in the composition and reinforcing its doctrine. This creates a calcrysteel that's lighter when the steel used to make it is just light, even more corrosion resistant than the corrosion-resistant steel used to make it, and even harder when the steel used to make it is merely hard.

It is in this that calcrysteel serves as a direct upgrade to steel in all contexts, and it sees plenty of use everywhere steel would be used if there is any possibility at all that the presence of calcic properties would be valued. This also results in it seeing plenty of use by Striders as weaves and rituals adhere to it once again.

**Tier Three - Tritanium**
An alloy created by the Academy for usage by its various operatives, this material is immensely powerful as it is an alloy of famylar, calcrysteel and the relic material **replichrome**. The combination of these three confer upon tritanium a litany of properties that make it the Academy's bare minimum for equipment used by its Operators.

Combining the doctrinal lightness of famylar with the cross-board superiority of calcrysteel already creates an almost 'fairy material'. The addition of replichrome however, grants tritanium 'self healing' properties by virtue of replichrome's ability to manufacture more of itself when fed calcic radiance. When tritanium is in molten state and then shaped, it 'remembers' that shape when cooled within a small margin of error. This means that while a hypothetical blade made of tritanium can be sharpened without its replichrome nature compelling it to replace the lost material from the sharpening process, thus dulling it, if that blade were to be chipped badly or snapped in half, it will passively feed on latent chalk to repair itself back to the original blade shape.

This dull yellow-ochre metal thus sees extensive use in Strider weaponry and equipment, as its unrivalled lightness, strength, calcic affinity and self-repairing properties makes it a material unlike anything in the Switchboard. 

As an aesthetic note, tritanium channeling or generally empowered with chalk glows a bright, neon yellow, giving weapons built from it the appearance of being made of pure energy.

**Tier Four - Pale Amara**
This purple crystal-metalloid is the product of harnessing '**amaranthite**', a fairly common crystal that forms in Isalveh, the Challenger Dark as a process of the natural crystallization of stardrip. Crushing, chalk, depthstone and amaranthite produces a white-black-purple powder blend that is then fired at supremely high temperature and pressure to force them to mix and create a 'liquid crystal' resultant that cools into solid crystal, which can then be cut down for usage in various applications.

Pale Amara appears as a deep purple solid seemingly variegated with white and black streaks through its crystalline structure. It also boasts immense hardness, and it finds its way into various cutting tools used in the Switchboard. ^37fdd7

It sees two particularly prominent uses however; in accelerator weapons and in the hands of Depthstriders. 

In axxel weapons or accelerator weapons, crystals of pale amara are used to accelerate matter by rapidly sending it forwards and backwards between the Switchboard and Isalveh, via shining light through it onto the piece of matter in an enclosed space. Providing an opening sees the material shunted out at immense velocity and possessing concerning amounts of energy, thus granting axxel weapons their lethality.

In the hands of depthstriders, their Void-gifted powers of curvature control are performed more powerfully when used with weapons formed from pale amara. Particularly, pale amara is capable of disrupting chalk systems, allowing depthstriders to counter attacks and rituals used by the chalkstrider cousins. Pale amara weaponry can magnify local curvature and anti-curvature, allowing them to induce strong gravitational fields. 

Where pale amara finds its greatest utility is its ability to **bridge calcic and depth reliant systems**. Where chalk needs to interact with the Void, pale amara is used as its constitution contains 'stabilized' forms of both. [[On Weave and Warfare#Pale Amaran|Pale Amarans]] require inculcations of pale amara to be able to use their 'Polarity' powers. 

**Tier Five - Hexic Kacherock**
The Vault Minds of the Switchboard are leftovers from a crueler era, as well as emerging with each passing second under the mechanics of chalk. Burdened with the doctrine of protection, they establish a series of machinations that result in the construction of the mighty Vaults of the Switchboard. Structurally, the Vaults of the Switchboard are built primarily out of **kacherock**, the result of material stripped from ancient regions and the chalk in them and their vicinity allowed to soak up the doctrine of the vault minds, aging them. This kacherock accumulates the secrets of ages, as currents of chalk used by the calculations of the Vault Minds and other super-regional constructs pass through the vaults, and the kacherock becomes a sort of naturally-occurring relic material.  ^09d274

Kache Krashers frequently search for the oldest kacherock in a Vault, often the deposits closest to the final chamber of the Vault and the resting place of the avatar of the Vault Mind, as these were the rock laid first. Extraction of this kacherock and firing it powerful furnaces melts it down, and when it cools and reforms, it adopts an inexplicable hexagonal structure that bestows upon it immense structural strength and defense against deformation. It finds much of its use in defensive applications - sheets of it used to fortify and armor constructs, and plates of it used in making high-level armor for Striders. The hexagonal crystal-metal adopts a characteristic fiery red-orange hue, pulsing dark and bright in tune with seemingly the 'heartbeat' of the Vault Mind from which the kacherock was initially harvested.

Additional utility is found in the aged chalk of hexic kacherock. Casting and channeling chalk through it bestows some of its aging upon it, maturing the chalk and enhancing the effectiveness of all calcic abilities used with it. In Strider weaponry it is used as an upgrade from the Academy's tritanium, and serves almost as a symbol of status among high level Striders, differentiating those who have conquered Vault from the rest.

	Truth bears six corners.

**Tier Six - Astratite**
A material that forms from law stars. During periods of surge in the Conflara season, law stars burn with truly mighty wrath, emanating waves of calcic radiance that rip through weaves throughout the Switchboard. Occasionally, some truly unstable stellar material lashes out as a tendril (similar to solar flares in our world) and occasionally this tendril touches a wellspring. It flash-transmutes the crystalline chalk there into something new, scorching it black with the pure wrath of the Switchboard's engines. This touch remains permanent, turning white chalk pitch black. 

Refinement of the scorched chalk is done using rituals, in which components bearing the aspect of heat and pressure compress and smelt the black chalk down into liquid resembling the pure sky of the Switchboard. It finally cools down into a twilit glass-like crystalline solid. It is not actually possible to cast astratite, and instead any application it is intended for requires inculcation of astratite into the subject by ritual means. Because of the sheer calcic power contained in astratite however, and the fact rituals 'uncork' this power briefly, it is immensely dangerous to work with, as allowing its volatile power to run rampant would be similar to having a piece of a law star in one's lap. Overwrite is guaranteed. Death only slightly less so.

Astratite sees particular use in the hands of Striders. Shards of it no bigger than coins can be drawn from and provide a calcic power boost so immense one can Stride without regard for information mass, or cast their Flash Protocol multiple times in succession. Of course, this is implicitly dangerous as not quickly dissipating the immensely powerful chalk coursing through one's body places them at risk of Overwrite. 

It sees extensive use in chalk ritualism as 'mark' and 'fire' components, and it serves to greatly empower rituals cast with it. 

Perhaps a final quality of astratite is that under circumstances it is capable of resisting Glass. A Strider having their lattice being consumed by glass can take astratite orally, and the pure calcic power within can flush their lattice and utterly overwhelm the Glass. Striders who are able keep a measure of it on their person, as a last resort against a glass-wielding threat.

**Tier Seven - Barristone**
Barristone is the headstone of law stars. It forms only when a law star dies.

What is left behind is supposedly white-gold rock, glowing so powerfully with calcic radiance that it unravels the lattices and weaves of all things around it, defeating every equation, overwhelming every ritual. It leads many to believe that there is no means in reality to actually handle it, and has also led many to conclude that nothing about it that is 'known' is actually true, as being in the mere presence of barristone would kill any possible observer.

The only thing confirming it exists is knowledge gleaned from the walls of Vaults, the fact the Astrolabe is built out of some modified form of it, and theorizing done by various Switchboard scientists. But none know how to check for it. None even know how to make a law star die, or what it even means for a law star to 'die'. 

### The Artifact Materials
For all the various artifact materials that exist in the Switchboard.

#### Replichrome
- Replichrome is a creation of the twin Fel-Arcad artifacts, the Loom and the Lathe. This artifact-material was spun into being with unique properties that would allow it to serve as the backbone of Fel-Arcad architecture, engineering, and by extension, civilization. 

- Being an artifact-material, replichrome possesses a Five Straits of its own, bestowed upon it by its artifact nature. In these Five Straits are the equations that give replichrome its unique property; the ability to fold chalk to create more of itself. When exposed to the calcic radiance from law stars, radiant chalk passes through a sample of replichrome's interface line into the potential line. From there it moves to the computational line, where the incalculably complex equation housed within the adjacent memory line guides the folding of the radiant chalk into more replichrome, which is output as physical deposits through the interface line. 

- Regarding its physical properties, replichrome is silvery-grey, strangely warm to the touch, metallic in appearance and feel. Regarding hardness and strength, replichrome boasts similarity to steel in this regard, making it an excellent material for construction when paired with its other qualities. It sees a willingness to take various forms, as it can be shaped easily when instructed to soften through the Five Straits, allowing for wire, sheet, bar, plate and more forms of it. It is fairly lightweight as well.

- Replichrome is incredibly corrosion resistant, and in general very resistant to the elements, including extreme temperature changes, moisture and abrasive damage. It is observed to rapidly dissipate high temperatures applied to it, making it very heat resistant as well. However, these qualities are do to its self-restorative properties; corrosion is sloughed away by more replichrome growing from underneath to replace corroded layers. Abrasive damage is fixed similarly by more material growing to fix the wounds. Even in the case of continuous expansion and contraction from temperature changes, replichrome effortlessly repairs this wear and tear as well.

- Speaking more on how it is used, the Five Straits within it allows it to be **programmed** to function in certain ways. This programming can be done with a Slate or a ritual.

- Normally, replichrome grows more of itself towards the direction of the source of calcic radiance, similar to plants. If replichrome is left on a desk near a window, it will grow towards the outdoors. This can result in a replichrome cube for example, growing quite askance, resulting in an irregular shape. One of the first things that can be programmed into a measure of replichrome is a **redistribution clause.** This instructs the interface line to output fresh replichrome according to provided rules. For example, a replichrome cylinder may have a redistribution clause where instead of growing towards the strongest source of radiance, it instead forms additional material to grow longer, or to shrink its internal  diameter.

- Second of these programmable clauses is the **pattern clause**. This instructs replichrome to repeat a certain structure using additional material output by the interface line. This is particularly useful when replichrome is used to make complex geometrical structures, such as tessellating plane shapes, or a mesh of replichrome woven in upon itself. In construction with replichrome, its common for weavers to design a sort of 'amenities plate'; a measure of replichrome that has been designed to have mounting points for various other constructs to be added later, such as securing brackets for pipes, mounting brackets for insulation, gutters for cables etc. and the pattern clause allows for recreating this amenities plate by growing it gradually through steadily feeding the replichrome with chalk.

- Third of these programmable clauses is the **assimilation clause**. Replichrome also has the ability to assimilate other materials into itself, and the weaver programming it is capable of instructing it to do different things with it. While replichrome is not able to create more of the materials assimilated into it, it *is* able to redistribute them and form them into new shapes. Replichrome can be fed a block of copper for example, and spit out wire coils. Programming replichrome to assimilate materials like this grant it the power to 'build' structures out of those materials. Replichrome can assimilate plastic and reform it into plumbing, assimilate copper and lay wiring, assimilate glass and place windows at intervals as the growing replichrome forms a wall around it, assimilate wood and lay panel of it over itself to hide it from view. As such it sees its ultimate utility in construction. 

- Outside construction, replichrome sees some utility in the sembleworks space, as its replicating properties can be easily transformed into self-healing properties, which find utility in self-repairing chromegrafts.
