# The Lattice as a Canvas
Chalk and its nature of ribbons and weaving have allowed for an expansion of what it means to 'be' in a physical sense. Chalk allows for the realization of a more desirable, more ideal, physical form - made possible by the malleability of the chalk lattice; its ability to be reshaped by the whims of a Strider. This is the Lattice as a Canvas; the self as both the loom that spins the cloth, and the outfit it will wear.

## Preamble
The Lattice as a Canvas stems from the principle of Chalk bridging the gaps in the sciences. By substituting the 'harder' science of biology as well as it's complex-at-best, nigh-unknowable-at-worst mechanics - with that of [[The Hands as Chalk]], principles that allow for playing fast and loose with the world around the subject, when applied to the physicality of the person, allows for a kind of 'malleability', existing in much the same vein as the Conjugation under [[Strider Descendance]]. More simply put, Chalk allows for bypassing the intricacies of biology, allowing for the body to become subject to - for want of a better phrase - root access by Striders.

LatCanvas seeks to discuss the ramifications of this, both physical and social/cultural. 

## Malleability of the Lattice
One of the natures of chalk is its power to bring amorphous concepts into clarity and distant ones into reach. It cuts out the middleman that is the natural sciences, simplifying the rules they play by, bringing the microscopic, the complex, into range where they can be touched, and made 'large' enough to make interacting with touch possible. 

We see this particularly in the [[On Weave and Warfare#The Theory of Damage|Theory of Damage]], which discusses the means by which injury and damage is dealt and sustained in the Switchboard. Under natural processes, cutting off an arm involves immense damage to flesh, bone, muscle and tissue. Under chalk, it can be better likened to violently ripping the sleeves from a shirt, snapping the stitches that held it there. Restoration of these stitches - repairing the lattice - is the method by which you'd restore the detached arm, an exercise that's fairly easy to do under chalk. Not so under the natural methods, where vessel must meet vessel, nerve connect to nerve, bone be made to articulate with bone - all things that are gambles in their likeliness to work. 

It follows then that if the lattice is simply a collection of woven chalk, then adding additional weaves to it shouldn't be beyond the question. 

## The Body-Loom
The Malleability of the Lattice has led Striders to pursue all manners of functional and aesthetic modifications to their persons, as they see fit. Most common are aesthetic changes, often of the color variety. Changes to eye and hair color, changes to skin color either localized to certain regions or a re-pigmentation of the entire surface. After that is usually facial modifications; changes to the shapes of the eyes, nose, mouth, modifications to the teeth, alteration of bone structure and the like. 

Modifications take a natural next step in the fabrication of 'grafts' - additional weaves designed to be compatible with the weave of a Strider, allowing them to be attached to the body and assimilate into the rest of their lattice. These can be additional parts such as horns, wings, a tail, or reworks of the skeletal plan; introducing additional joints or new limbs entirely. Production of these parts is done by sampling the weave pattern of a Strider's own lattice, and spinning these new grafts on 'looms' from chalk ribbons - or in some cases - forming them using formative rituals. 

	Because these modifications are now baked into the lattice of a Strider, there is a non-zero chance that they become qualities passed down to descendants through the Conjugation. It often results in some Strider families having identifiable shared characteristics that define them.

	This is definitely a noteworthy plot-point concerning the Fel-Arcad, to be elaborated upon in their document when eventually created. 

## Chrome
'Chrome' in the Switchboard is a term for cybernetics; grafts that are more closely machine in their make and behavior. They make up the more function-oriented aspect of the Malleability, Striders choosing them to enhance abilities and provide new ones.

	This section is incomplete. More work is needed here, which will ultimately be the product of further discussion. Particularly what needs discussing is what advantage chrome presents over lattice, the consequences of using it, the culture around it, the like. 

### Notes
Striders often 'install' relics to their person to use them more effectively, the most common example of this being the Slate. 

Maybe it's incorrect to say 'cybernetics' in the sense of metal and silicon parts. Maybe we mean something else a few steps back; artificial lattices. Lattices built from scratch, where the only similarity they share with the Strider and their lattice is being built to be compatible with it when eventually grafted on. Suppose a Strider rebuilt their entire body completely out of relics forged in super-complex rituals, is that not cybernetics in some way? I am unsure, but there is something to pursue here.

> I had the idea of 'Chromegraft' as an alternative name for cybernetics as they are employed in the Switchboard. It stresses the fact that they are primarily created from weaving chalk and chrome, and bear a calcic-mechanical nature. 

## Emergent Minds
Derivative of the nature of [[The Hands as Chalk#Spontaneous Equations|spontaneous equations]], chalk occasionally folds itself - and via self correction mechanisms and selection - into elementary calcic intelligences. They cannot exist for very long without bodies (or 'vessels') and so they swiftly inhabit any nearby objects at the site of their formation.

	These minds tend to emerge at locales of high calcic activity, particular noteworthy are areas where large amounts of chalk were used offensively, such as old battlefields, abandoned settlements, crash sites for ships etc. Typically, where there were once minds, emergent minds arise in their wake.

An object or collection of objects are 'possessed' with the emergent mind to grant them a body, curiously knowing innately that they require limbs capable of manipulation and locomotion. Most noteworthy however, is their primal nature as beings that were once ordinary chalk not long before; they possess an ability to manipulate chalk ribbon and weave with startling proficiency, granting them abilities that could be seen as approaching 'psychic'.

## A New Doctrine of Shape
The Lattice as a Canvas allows for almost on-impulse change in the manner of being of those who find themselves interested in it. The malleability of the lattice allows for an expansion of what it means to 'be'. With the shape of being subject to the being itself, we may then ask ourselves what is the final frontier of the canvas. What is the final shape that can be conceived by a being?

> I want to explore something in a video game - **Caves of Qud** - specifically an endgame locale known as [Chavvah, the Tree of Life](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Chavvah). Chavvah is a sentient tree-city populated by also sentient crystal leaf-entities that possess both an individualism in that they have names and selves, and a pluralism as a collective known as 'Chavvah'. By psychic links, each member of the collective of Chavvah communicate, and it is this link that is itself Chavvah; a conglomerate of many minds into one, or maybe a division of one mind into many, each individual entity merely some shard of the whole capable of existing on its own. 

In which we ask ourselves, once again, what is the final shape that can be conceived as a being? What can be counted as a shape? Could some denizen of the Switchboard become - or ascend beyond - a body as we understand bodies? Or rather because the mechanics for doing so already exists, on what grounds do we forbid them from doing so? I feel there are none. That the malleability of the lattice allows for the existence of this concept in narrative if not an in-depth exploration of it.
