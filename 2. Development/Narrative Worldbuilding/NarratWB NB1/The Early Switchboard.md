# The Early Switchboard
An outline of the youngest days of the Switchboard, from inception in the chalk-weaving furnaces of probability to the first nomads to traverse the ten Astrolabic regions. It delves further into the first major Strider families, their inquiry into the nature of their world, all the while it grows and reshapes itself around them.
