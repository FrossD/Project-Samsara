# Character Template
The people of the Switchboard.

## Rough
The character templates roughly use an engineered framework called the **MBS Framework**. This stands for **Mind**, **Body** and **Spirt**, are meant to encapsulate different aspects of characters.

Roughly, they translate to;

- **Mind**
	- Identity
	- Self-perceptions
	- Multivariate intelligence
	- History and Background

- **Body**
	- Appearance
	- Physicality
	- Modifications

- **Spirit**
	- Goals, Aims and Aspirations
	- Flaws and Bad Habits

> More to come under these.

Under each section are headings and subheading as well as definitions for the scope of each. This particular framework is a colossal undertaking, as the sheer scope of what is to be defined is non-trivial.

Each individual characteristic of a character is a **metric**, with the intention of denoting a 'measure of a quantity'. While this works for conventionally numerical measures such as height and weight, we are also applying it for other 'measures' such as hair color and the like.

# Development
This is not the final template that will be relatively empty, designed to be exported to other character documents and filled in as needed, but rather the design document used to build that framework.

## Body
Appearance and physicality.

### Class A - Baseline
- Sex
>	~~Used primarily to answer the question of "What's in the pants?" more than anything.~~
>	**Hex's Commentary**
>	- Under '**Body**', just describe the person's body. Under '**Mind**', put their identity and pronouns.
>	- Under *narrative*, you can put whether this person risked the negative consequences of a powerful ritual to alter their body significantly.
>	- Gender identity, pronouns, a physical description (perhaps you could ask Treen what she wants from clients commissioning a character sheet, which often includes a nude image?), and a little narrative background that may include some details about their trans identity.
>	- Treen says you can just say a character has a dick.
>		- Going 'Apparatus P' and 'Apparatus V' for this one.
>		- This is an in-canon joke and not an allusion to my disposition about the whole thing I swear.
- Voice
- Hair
>	Sub-metrics here included;
>	 - Color
>	 - Length
>	 - Style
>		 - 'Style' allows me to refer to existing hairstyles, or even the bearers of certain hairstyles that exist in the real world.
- Eyes
>	Sub-metrics here include;
>	- Pupil Color
>	- Pupil Shape
>	- Sclera Color
- Height
- Weight
- Build
>	Despite 'Height' and 'Weight' being metrics that exist, 'Build' is also essential as those two former quantities can be somewhat skewed by other quirks of a character, particular bits under Class C2.
- Switchboard Family/Ethnicity 

### Class B - SADEV Physiology
> A measure of a character's overall physicality. These metrics are particularly useful in ascertaining the combat capability of a character, and are additionally skewed in various directions by the existence of Class C2 metrics.

- Strength
>	1. **Lifting Capacity:** The maximum weight a character can lift.
>	2. **Striking Power:** The force behind physical blows or attacks.
>	3. **Grip Strength:** How firmly a character can hold onto objects.

- Agility
>	1. **Reaction Time:** Speed of response to stimuli or unexpected events.
>	2. **Balance:** The ability to maintain stability during movement or while stationary.
>	3. **Flexibility:** Range of motion in joints and the ability to stretch.

- Dexterity
>	1. **Fine Motor Skills:** Precision in handling small or delicate objects.
>	2. **Hand-Eye Coordination:** Synchronization of hand movements with visual perception.
>	3. **Ambidexterity:** Capability to use both hands with equal skill.

- Endurance
>	1. **Cardiovascular Endurance:** Efficiency of the cardiovascular system over a sustained period.
>	2. **Muscular Endurance:** How well muscles can perform repetitive tasks without fatigue.
>	3. **Pain Tolerance:** Ability to withstand physical discomfort for an extended duration.

- Vitality
>	1. **Overall Health:** The character's general well-being, including the immune system.
>	2. **Resistance to Illness:** Ability to fend off diseases.
>	3. **Recovery Rate:** Speed at which the character recuperates from injuries or exhaustion.

### Class C1 - Light Body Mods
> Where applicable, entries here override identical previous entries. Hair recolorations here, for example, override hair in the baseline.

- Piercings
- Scars
>	Scars earned and not placed.

>	Grafts more focused on function. Certain 'sites' for grafts exist, described in [[On Birthing and Being#Narrative Note Chromegraft Points|chromegraft points]].
- Latticegrafts
>	Functional, non-chrome grafts for the subject.

### Class D - Attire and Adornment
- Attire (Clothes)
- Adornments (Jewelry, Accessories)

> Indications will be made for certain attire and accessories that are worn for reasons beyond individual appeals of the character. This encompasses clothes worn as uniform, for creed reasons, etc.

### Class E - Conduct
> How the body is being used, as it were.

- Mannerisms
- Tics
- Posture
