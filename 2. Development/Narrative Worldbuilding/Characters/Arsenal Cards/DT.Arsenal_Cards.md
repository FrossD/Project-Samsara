## Adven Ventura
New Ventura loadout is centered around the **stance transition** built into his Relic Firearm: the **Sojourner's Tale**. These stances are the **Marksman** and **Gambler** stances, where 'Marksman' focuses on using Ventura's Tek, the **Trajectory Calculator** to dispense highly-accurate fire over long distances, while 'Gambler' makes use of a **pact** with a Skydancer to trade accuracy for damage. Certain parts of Ventura's loadout are now only usable when in certain stances, or are modified depending on the stance.

> Marksman Stance is indicated with **MS**.
> Gambler Stance is indicated with **GS**.

### Reworks
**Relic Martial Arm**
- [x] The relic **Feat** is now the **Stance Transition**.
- [x] **Compression Chamber** is now under **MS**.
- [x] **Second Cylinder** is now under **GS**.
- [x] **Sidewinder Feed System** is now moved under **Utility**.
	- [x] **Sidewinder Feathergrips** is now under **GS**.
	- [x] **Sidewinder Feed System** is now under **GS**.

**Weave Dash**
- [x] **Marksman's Gambit** is now **Gunfighter's Gambit**
	- [x] It now axles upon the Relic Firearm
	- [x] It now behaves differently based on the active **Stance**
		- [x] In MS, projectiles caught in the field generate ballistics data, but don't refill the magazine of the currently held weapon
		- [x] In GS, projectiles caught in the field generate ammunition for the active weapon, but no ballistic data

**Tek**
- [x] His Tek **Burst** is fully deprecated, instead realized as the Relic Defensive.

**Weave Charge**
- **Interceptor Flechette** can only be performed in MS.

### New
**Relic Martial Arm**
- [x] The Sojourner's Tale gains a Relic **Defensive**
	- [x] **Sidewinder's Fire Veil** creates a passive shield around the user that intercepts oncoming fire using weave. This can be cast on others as well.
	- [x] This can only be used under **MS**. Transiting Stance dismisses all active instances of the inductive effect that is the Fire Veil.

**Stance Transition**
Manipulating the ritualism in the Sojourner's Tale allows for transiting active forms on the handcannon. 

- [x] **Marksman Stance** uses Ventura's **Tek** as an Axle, and attacks made while MS is active generates **Ballistics Data**, that is usable in other parts of Ventura's loadout.
- [x] **Gambler Stance** invokes a **Skydancer Pact** with Skydancer Leilani, The Reveler. The tenets of this pact is that Ventura may not use his Tek to enhance the accuracy of his shots, and in return, his shots gain a considerable boost to damage.

**Weave Charge**
- [x] Ventura gains a new Weave Charge, **Fan the Hammer**
	- [x] This technique weaves a phantom striking hammer on whatever firearm is in Ventura's hands, and allows for fanning this hammer to fire considerably faster on weapons with slow fire-rates.
	- [x] This can only be performed in GS.

**Flash Protocol**
- [x] Ventura gains his third Flash Protocol, **Reveler Rounds**.

# Deprecated Arsenal Card Contents
Removed bits from Arsenal Cards.

## Hex
Stolen Armament - Black | Offensive
**Spiraling Charge** - Cado, Brch, Comp
*"The beasts of Isalveh dictated the rules of battle. And so I learned."*
	Ellaine can perform a charge, leaping at its apex to spin and gore a target with their crystalline horns, doing heavy piercing damage and breaching armor. On strike, they are afflicted with Ellaine's **witchfire**, which burns away at their computational strait and inhibits their ability to strategize, perform advanced techniques of either white or black, and exercise various mental faculties.

A case study/example outline of a Character Arsenal using Adven Ventura.

**Mundane - Tier 1**
- Martial Arm: **Tritanium Longsword** (MOD Relic Longsword)
- Firearm: **Sojourner's Tale** (MOD Relic Handcannon)
- Tertiary: **Praxlance**
**Notes**
	The Sojourner's Tale is an eight-shot handcannon made to order and refit for unparalleled accuracy. It fires specialized 'keyhole' rounds spun from ribbon by Ventura himself.

**Elementary Calcic - Tier 2**
- Weave Strike: **Priming Bolt**
	  A ranged calcic attack. Chalk is spun into the shape of bolt and flung at a target with high speed and accuracy. On impact, it does critical damage to armor and inflicts a lattice vulnerability to piercing attacks.
- Woven Charges: 
	- **Saboteur's Charge**
	  A grenade is woven from chalk. It resembles a small cube that can be thrown from the hand or attached to surfaces, where it lies in wait for targets. On detonation, it violently unweaves into sound and light, deploys a slowing field that affects all targets within and a electrical pulse that targets weapons with onboard computational systems, slates and chromegrafts.
	  - **Interceptor Flechette**
	A grenade is woven and tossed, resembling a small sphere that can be thrown from the hand. When the fuse expires, it uses Ventura's Tek to calculate the path of various projectiles moving within its blast radius. Upon detonation, it fires out a swarm of flechette projectiles that intercept them, knocking them off course.
- Knit-Shield: **Projectile Net**
	  A field projected from an outstretched hand. This shield ability manifests as a net of chalk ribbon that arrests the momentum of any projectiles fired at it. The momentum stolen from them can be turned into calcic charge.
- Weft Dash: **Calculated Leap**
	Ventura performs a highly calculated jump, simulating all major and minor movements required to move through a space and the exact amount of chalk that must be flared to produce enough velocity to perform it, and land at an exact position. This leap takes into consideration all possible obstacles to his flight using his Trajectory Calculator, allowing him to leap through swarms of moving projectiles (such as hailstorm of bullets) without issue.
- Woven Armament: **Stabilizer Lattice**
	When Ventura wields a firearm, weave keeps it firmly in his grip, transferring firing control and recoil compensation to his entire body rather than solely his arm. This allows for making immensely accurate shots, and doing so repeatedly with very little accuracy loss over time.

**Advanced Calcic - Tier 3**
- Tek: **Trajectory Calculator**
	  A passive **modification** Tek that grants the ability to lock on to, track and calculate the path and strike location of any projectile in motion. Deploying an invisible graduated lattice creates a three-dimensional spatial ruler that allows for calculating and thus predicting the path of a projectile. If Ventura aims his pistol, he is able to predict where the shot will land. If he sees an incoming projectile, he is able to intercept it with a shot of his own. It sees its true power in its ability to calculate **rebounds**; in addition to calculating where a projectile will strike, he can also calculate the trajectory the projectile will take when it ricochets. This allows Ventura to - rather uncannily - bank shots off surfaces to shoot at targets around corners.
- Qui: **Hardpoint Calcic Rounds**
	  Ventura summons a qui-wheel, feeds it (ritual components) and eight rounds of ammunition for his handcannon, transforming them into hardpoint calcic rounds. These shots rebound off targets irrespective of the hardness of the struck surface, and can do so a number of times. Due to their hard tips, they can also pierce targets, and can continue on their path, rebound and strike the same target again. Hardpoints do considerably more damage to targets that have piercing vulnerabilities inflicted upon them. 
- Qui: **Unravelling Rounds**
	  Ventura summons a qui-wheel, feeds it (ritual components) and eight rounds of ammunition for his handcannon, transforming them into unravelling rounds. These rounds inflict an amount of chaos to the lattices of Striders and Weavers, inflicting unravelling upon them, but not doing much by way of physical damage. These rounds are used more to sabotage an enemy combatant, or as a way to suppress a target for capture.

**Ultimate Calcic - Tier 4**
- Flash Protocol: **Ricochet Barrage**
	  Ventura weaves eight hardpoints, then flashcharges the Sojourner's Tale handcannon, his Tek, and all eight hardpoint rounds. The flashcharge rapidly accelerates the matter of the rounds, turning them into partially energy ammunition (as is fired from Axxel weaponry), granted them a massively increased ability to pierce. Flashcharging his handcannon allows it to fire with unrivalled accuracy, as well as confers additional muzzle velocity on the accelerated hardpoints. Flashcharging his Tek allows him to calculate many, many rebounds deep for multiple projectiles. Ventura - within the space of a fraction of a second - then calculates and fires all eight rounds, such that they fly, strike, pierce and ricochet of any number of surfaces, flying, striking and piercing the target again and again, until they are shredded to pieces by gunfire.
- Signature Ritual: **Safe Passage**
	  Ventura draws a chalk circle and performs a ritual, expending an amount of components. All within the effective range of the ritual have their effective information mass lowered, allowing them to stride further and carry more cargo. 

**Auxiliary Powers**
- Doctrinal Power (Tier 3): **Doctrine of Strength**
	  A passive ability granted to Ventura due to his unwavering confidence in the power of strength. Attacks he makes against targets weaker than him do more damage, and calcic dividends are extracted from them to fuel his own abilities. Additionally, even when critically unraveled, Ventura is still able to accumulate chalk and empower his base weapons with it.
- Doctrinal Power (Tier 1): **The Sil'khan**
	  Ventura's pride in his Sil'khan roots empowers him. When fighting away from home, Ventura's abilities are empowered. When fighting on new frontiers, in Vaults or in different planes, Ventura is further empowered. 
- Titular Power (Tier 3): **The Strider Sojourner**
	  Ventura's notoriety earned by virtue of his ability to seemingly traverse the Switchboard under any conditions has empowered his Strider Protocol. Ventura is able to passively accumulate chalk mid-stride, and can no longer fall into the Void. This passive chalk accumulation allows for extending the distances he can stride, as well as replace momentum lost due to travel.
