## Adven Ventura
New Ventura loadout is centered around the **stance transition** built into his Relic Firearm: the **Sojourner's Tale**. These stances are the **Marksman** and **Gambler** stances, where 'Marksman' focuses on using Ventura's Tek, the **Trajectory Calculator** to dispense highly-accurate fire over long distances, while 'Gambler' makes use of a **pact** with a Skydancer to trade accuracy for damage. Certain parts of Ventura's loadout are now only usable when in certain stances, or are modified depending on the stance.

> Marksman Stance is indicated with **MS**.
> Gambler Stance is indicated with **GS**.

### Reworks
**Relic Martial Arm**
- The relic **Feat** is now the **Stance Transition**.
- **Compression Chamber** is now under **MS**.
- **Second Cylinder** is now under **GS**.
- **Sidewinder Feed System** is now moved under **Utility**.
	- **Sidewinder Feathergrips** is now under **GS**.
	- **Sidewinder Feed System** is now under **GS**.

**Weave Dash**
- **Marksman's Gambit** is now **Gunfighter's Gambit**
	- It now axles upon the Relic Firearm
	- It now behaves differently based on the active **Stance**
		- In MS, projectiles caught in the field generate ballistics data, but don't refill the magazine of the currently held weapon
		- In GS, projectiles caught in the field generate ammunition for the active weapon, but no ballistic data

**Tek**
- His Tek **Burst** is fully deprecated, instead realized as the Relic Defensive.

**Weave Charge**
- **Interceptor Flechette** can only be performed in MS.

### New
**Relic Martial Arm**
- The Sojourner's Tale gains a Relic **Defensive**
	- **Sidewinder's Fire Veil** creates a passive shield around the user that intercepts oncoming fire using weave. This can be cast on others as well.
	- This can only be used under **MS**. Transiting Stance d

**Stance Transition**
Manipulating the ritualism in the Sojourner's Tale allows for transiting active forms on the handcannon. 

- **Marksman Stance** uses Ventura's **Tek** as an Axle, and attacks made while MS is active generates **Ballistics Data**, that is usable in other parts of Ventura's loadout.
- **Gambler Stance** invokes a **Skydancer Pact** with Skydancer Leilani, The Reveler. The tenets of this pact is that Ventura may not use his Tek to enhance the accuracy of his shots, and in return, his shots gain a considerable boost to damage.

**Weave Charge**
- Ventura gains a new Weave Charge, **Fan the Hammer**
	- This technique weaves a phantom striking hammer on whatever firearm is in Ventura's hands, and allows for fanning this hammer to fire considerably faster on weapons with slow fire-rates.
	- This can only be performed in GS.

**Flash Protocol**
- Ventura gains his third Flash Protocol, **Recoil Rider**
	- This technique hinges on the Relic Firearm
	- This technique allows for for ludicrous target acquisition and firing.
	- Expand on this later.

*"The beasts of Isalveh dictated the rules of battle. And so I learned."*
	Ellaine can perform a charge, leaping at its apex to spin and gore a target with their crystalline horns, doing heavy piercing damage and breaching armor. On strike, they are afflicted with Ellaine's **witchfire**, which burns away at their computational strait and inhibits their ability to strategize, perform advanced techniques of either white or black, and exercise various mental faculties.
