# Arsenal Card: Riftlock Blakk
Depthstrider Blakk, Rogue Riftlock and former Master of Artifice for a Veiled Daughter enters the battlefield. Her attunement with the Depths and frequent supplication to the Amaranth Sultan through feats of innovation and engineering has granted her a vast, blessed toolbelt of unrivalled versatility. Specializing in command of various **technological relics**, there is no situation she cannot meet head-on. And when the opportunity arises, she can deploy their foul **black ice**, and shatter heretical foes with crushing force.

## T1 - Void-Enhanced Armament
### Given Armament
**Rift Vibrokhopesh** - Curved Sword
*"All who say I betrayed the Daughter I served are liars. I was loyal, decorated, and left as such. Here is the proof."*
	A curved length of hardened pale amara mocks an axeblade as it takes the form of a sword. Along its length are carved scripture from the Depthstone Codices, and its handle, fine leather wrapped around the full-tang crystal. In the hands of a Depthstrider, it strafes this realm and the other.

- Offensive
**Blakkstrikes** - Brch, Cado, Siph, Unrav
Axle: Formshift | Re-Innovate
*"The Daughter gave me a charge; 'go, show them the depths of the Void; the all-encompassing wrath therein'."*
	This attack synergizes with Blakk's **Formshift**, and does additional damage based on the number of **innovation charges** that Blakk has accumulated through formshifts, **capped at twenty charges** expended. This strike bypasses and destroys armor, cuts, siphons chalk and suppresses further chalkweaving. It is Blakk's most powerful technique.
 
- Utility
**Momentum Conduit**
*"You know its working when it starts singing."*
	 The Rift Vibrokhopesh shunts constantly between the Dancirah and the Challenger Dark, its blade thus being a densely-contained piece of crystal with immensely high momentum but little apparent displacement. With a touch, it can impart this momentum on structures sensitive to it.

### Taken Armament
**Crash Spanner** - Quarterstaff
*"Percussive maintenance is the term you're looking for; I am not just 'smashing things'.*"
	A rough, dark metal spanner roughly the height of it's wielder, carried and used as a quarterstaff. Put into spin, it is capable of delivering crushing blows to man and machine alike.
 
- Offensive
**Gravstrike** - Brch
*"Force is mass times acceleration."*
	Blakk uses their powers of curvature manipulation to rapidly accelerate the end of their weapon, allowing them to inflict brutally crushing blows.

- Defensive
**Interceptor Spin**
*"I stuck a finger in there once. Still haven't found it."*
	 Blakk throws the Crash Spanner ahead of them and uses curvature manipulation to spin it rapidly in the air, blocking oncoming projectiles. Sturdier attacks can interrupt the spin, and thus it is not effective against them.

### Forged Armament
(N/A)
*"In time."*

## T2 - Curvature Manipulation
### Point Attraction/Repulsion
**Calculated Assembly**
*"80% of the screws make it into the finished product. A passing grade by all metrics. I pride myself on doing more with less."*
	If Blakk has the component parts, and is aware of the internal workings of an object, such as through a blueprint, they can use their powers of attraction and repulsion to spontaneously assemble it. 

**Calculated Disassembly**
*"I think we should just outlaw glue actually. I think people who use glue should be forced to drown in the violet."*
	If Blakk knows the internal workings of an object, such as through a blueprint. They can use their powers of attraction and repulsion to spontaneously disassemble it.

**Rapid Disassembly**
*"The road to engineering that lasts is paved with the bodies of apprentices that didn't."*
	Blakk is able to use a rough assumption of the innerworkings of something to spontaneously disassemble it in the space of a finger snap. This can result in damage to the workings of the target, however.

### Selective Action
**Bangle Box**
*"The Daughter's courts enforced a real nuisance of a dress code. I had to wear jewelry. I've never been a fan of it; it's small, fiddly, jams up stuff, and I kept losing it. But this helped."*
	Blakk's Selective Action allows her to filter metal from non-metal, using the divine calculus of the Amaranth Sultan. Metals are attracted to her, and non-metal pushed away.

### Paired Points
## T3 - Draws From The Void
### Gifts and Possessions of the Void
**Cache of Contraptions**
*"A visiting Daughter once asked the one I served, 'What kind of people survive in the Dark?'. The question was posed to me instead. What I said then is what I'll say now; the punchers, the runners, the Void has them plenty, both on the fields and under them. But the thinkers? The thinkers last. I have chosen to be a thinker."*
	Lurking just under the local Horizon is Blakk's Cache of Contraptions, their personal toolbelt of answers to every question. By carving a rift and reaching into the depths, they can retrieve a contraption and deploy in battle as they see fit. With their Formshift, they can manipulate the nature of each contraption to ensure they are always ready for whatever the Switchboard brings.

**Contraption #1 - Strafe Boosters**
*"By eliminating the need to walk, we raised workshop efficiency by 35%. The number of workshop incidents increased as well during this period, but I am certain it is unrelated."*
	Retrofitted Fel-Arcad competitive rocketskates expand upwards to the waist with layered armored plate, spring-reliant shock absorbers, redundant gyro sensors and accelerometers, and high-throughput exhaust vents. With them, Blakk gains considerable mobility.
 - Utility
**Cruise Control**
*"nnnnnnneeeeaaaAAAARRRROOWWW"*
	Blakk gains the ability to hover above the ground as well as a considerable boost to speed, allowing them to skate rapidly across the battlefield, repositioning to dodge attacks or launch them.
 - Offensive - Skew
**Blast Hack**
*"Whiplash builds character."*
	Additional boosters are fitted to the back of the Strafe Booster assembly, and the internal enginery is replaced with a high-capacity battery. Blakk's hovering and passive mobility are disabled, in favor of bursts of high speed and maneuverability after the battery is charged. For brief moments, Blakk can move at speeds close to that of sound, but they are balanced by downtimes of needing to recharge.
 - Utility - Skew
**Featherlight Hack**
*"Its both more and less fun than you'd think."*
	Curvature-inducing retrofits are built into the booster assembly, allowing Blakk to use them to fly. While vertical movement is fairly swift, horizontal movement is mildly curtailed. 

**Contraption #2 - Repulsor Plate**
*"Its a little heavy on the upper-body, and it certainly isn't the best thing in my wardrobe, but I'd be dead and gone without it."*
	Depthstone-impregnated particle suspension chambers controlled by proximity sensor lattices, interlaced with chainmail, solid plate and featherlight padding creates a void-attuned breastplate capable of defeating all manners of threats.
- Defensive
**Gossamer Barricade**
*"I can tune it to even repel air."*
	The Repulsor Plate uses user-tunable threat detection algorithms to induce repulsive pockets of force to repel incoming threats. It boasts considerable utility against projectiles, and even attacking personnel can be kept well beyond arm's length.
- Offensive - Skew
**Slam Hack**
*"It genuinely never stops being funny."*
	The Repulsor Plate is refitted with a battery. When charged, it analyzes all targets in local space and selects according to parameters most likely to be met by a human target. It then induces a considerable repulsive force right under them, launching them into the air, followed by an even more intense attractive force that pulls them back down, slamming them into the ground. This attack has an internal cooldown dictated by the Repulsor Plate's battery.
- Utility - Skew
**Cloak Hack**
*"There are times I've used it while sitting at my desk, and watched as people stumble around my office, files in hand, wondering if they should drop them or go look for me. But I usually get caught, often from laughing too hard."*
	Local manipulation of air allows for distorting the form, interfering with observation mechanisms ranging from mundane visuals to Chalkweaver Weavesight.

**Contraption #3 - Assault Gauntlets**
*"It's very straightforward."*
	From the shoulders to the fingertips are reticulated metal plates fastened and layered, servos constraining the imperfect twitches of the arm. Force-multiplying motors grant strength to every movement, and lashed to the forearms are twin-barrel machine guns; the answer to many a stupid question.
- Offensive
**Barrage** - Cado, Siph
*"Very, very straightforward."*
	Blakk takes aim and fires a barrage of pale amara projectiles. They pierce and siphon chalk from the targets they strike, empowering Blakk as a denizen of the depths.
  - Offensive - Skew
**Napalm Hack** - Induc, Siph
*"Let 'em stew.'"*
	The twin machinegun barrels are cycled out in favor of a nozzle, and a canister is fitted to the back. Blakk can blast dense swathes of incredibly hot flames at close targets, incinerating them and inflicting heavy inductive burn, as well as siphoning their calcic reserves.
 - Offensive - Skew
**Railgun Hack** - Brch, Cado, Unrav, Prax
Axle: Formshift | Re-Innovate
*"Tuned. Over-tuned possibly. Maybe more than possibly. Almost certainly. I might have been asked to stop using it."*
	Blakk holds both arms parallel and aims at a target, while the thermal capacitors in the gauntlets begin to charge. At full capacity, they fire a depthstone projectile with ludicrous velocity, piercing and breaching armor and inflicting heavy unravelling on targets hit by it.
	Additionally, the damage done by the railgun scales with the **hack counter**; the number of active hacks on currently active contraptions. At **five stacks**, the railgun gains a praxis component to its damage, and deals additional damage against **those who hold ill sentiment towards the things of the Void**.
 - Offensive
**Hook-shot Hack** - Induc
*"If I really focus, I can pluck a hair off a beard. Usually I just break a nose."*
	The gauntlets are refitted with repulsion-capable apparatus and high-strength chain, allowing for launching the arms and retracting them. Should they strike a target, Blakk can reel them in while they are unable to resist due to a heavy inductive stun. If they fire at an object, they can reel it towards them, or reel themselves towards it.

- **Contraption #4 - Hyper Visors**
*"Helps me keep track of loose screws."*
 
 
- **Contraption #5 - Black Ice Shield**
> Can only be summoned last.
> Attacks expend innovation charges.

### Draw Strike
**Hazard Drawer** - Cado, Brch, Induc, Unrav
*"The mark of a good engineer is organization. The mark of a better engineer is not needing it."*
	When Blakk executes her **Innovation Routine** formshift, one of six phenomena occur, randomly chosen;
	- Three to five weave-seeking missiles emerge from the rift and hunt down the strongest discernable targets in the vicinity, exploding once sufficiently close-by. 
	- The vicinity is suffused with toxic gas, doing damage exclusively to those bearing the Strider Protocol.
	- A blinding flash, disorienting sonic follow-up, and a final devastating repelling wave surge from the rift, stunning all targets and flinging them back considerable
	- An explosion of lacerating depthstone shrapnel that rips through friend and foe alike, defeating defenses and armor.
	- A shower of oil that suffuses the air and slicks the ground beneath, before violently igniting.
	- A burst of immensely powerful hyperweave that crackles indiscriminately through the air, sundering chalk and weave with destabilizing ribbon.

### Formshift
**Innovation Routine**
*"I was never the best acolyte, but I did what I had to. It's paid off."*
  
Blakk's Formshift allows them to return contraptions in the Cache of the Contraptions after summoning them. When Blakk summons a contraption from their cache, they expend one 'charge' of '**Innovation**'. Blakk is able to summon the first contraption - that is, no other contraptions are active - for free. All of Blakk's contraptions are summoned as **possessions** by default. 

However, when Blakk formshifts a contraption in **possession state**, it expends an innovation charge and returns as a **gift from the void**, with a skew known as a **hack**. These hacks alter the **functionality of contraptions** in Blakk's active arsenal, and adds a charge to Blakk's **hack counter**. Additionally, triggering re-**Innovate** on a contraption - that is innovating/formshifting a contraption with an active hack/skew - **refunds two Innovation charges**, which allows Blakk to summon more contraptions.

Thus, Blakk can summon their first contraption for free, and then **innovate** upon it to gain a contraption with a hack and two charges of Innovation. With these two charges, they can summon two more contraptions, expending all Innovation charges. With three contraptions active however (and one of them with an active hack), Blakk can re-**innovate** all of them, obtaining three contraptions with hacks and two Innovation charges. These two charges allow for summon the last two contraptions, leaving Blakk with five contraptions active; three with hacks and two without them. Re-innovating the entire contraption set yields five contraptions with hacks and six innovation charges, and innovating again yields ten more charges, for a total of sixteen.

Blakk can also **expend two innovation charges** to formshift a contraption with a hack (a void gift) and return it to the Void, to then re-Take it as a contraption in base form with no hacks (a void possession). Contraptions with active hacks add to Blakk's **hack counter**.

Both the innovation charges and the hack counter are used to scale the effectiveness of Blakk's attacks. 

## T4 - The Deep Hollow
### Hollow Basilica
**Ill-Fitted Workshop** - Induc, Comp, Unrav, Prax 
*"We can all learn a thing or two from each other. Like workplace safety. But not from me."*

Blakk takes hold of local space and plunges it into the depths, expanding a consecrated space encircled by an impassable boundary of prohibitive curvature; the Deep Hollow. Performed with a spread-palmed slap on the ground, all caught in its rapidly expanding range are transported into the excavated hollow, and compelled to engage by the rules of Blakk's Basilica.

Blakk's Basilica takes the shape of a metalworking workshop, a spherical space built of dull riveted alloy and piercingly bright lights. Machines of all disciplines - lathes, mills, presses and grinders - take hallowed positions on the cramped floorspace, workbenches littered with files, calipers and blowtorches. Lined against one wall are canisters of all manners of gases, valves at their necks and pipes disappearing into corners and crevices. Cabinets line the wall filled with aged metalwork. An oil slick mocks the mop propped next to it, a shrine to the evils of procrastination. Levers sprout from a central junction box, labeled worryingly with various descriptions of grievous bodily harm. At its center, a vaulted chair, cushioned, regally placed, mechanical arms snapping from its backrest, glowing wires spiraling out from its beneath, blinking monitors bathing it in blue halogen. It watches over the entire workshop, and the steel-bronze scrap-work sculpture of a Daughter leans over it, veil drooping as a willow, watches over the mechanic at its center.

Being a Basilica, both the Forbid and the Binding are active. Blakk's Binding is fairly simple; all within the Basilica space are compelled to assemble a metal box by cutting, folding and welding sheet metal. Should the box be assembled by all parties successfully, the Hollow resolves and dissipates.

The win state for Blakk within her Hollow is for the other parties in it with her to not notice that the lever controlling the ventilation systems is flung down, thus disabling the exhaust fans and rendering her workshop unsafe to work within. Should parties in the workshop perform any welding while the ventilation system remains off, they are immediately struck by the massively toxic fumes from vaporizing flux, causing them to sustain a heavy inductive poison that tears through their lattice, as well as computational damage that inhibits their performance of chalkweaving and other abilities, heavy unravelling that further restricts any calcic casting, and finally a heavy dose of praxis sundering that weakens them, their allies, and connected parties even further. At this point, Blakk may complete her own assembly of the metal box - with a gas mask equipped - and thus fulfill the Binding of her Basilica, causing it to resolve and collapse.

The intricacies of Blakk's Basilica Binding is that a single box must be assembled before the Hollow can resolve, and thus Blakk is incentivized by the logic of her Hollow and derivative battle strategy to never weld first. If she does, and doesn't weld with either a gas mask on or after turning on the ventilation, she will be struck by her own poisonous flux vapors, and indicate to those within the Hollow that something must be done to nullify the danger posed by gas in an enclosed space.

Should the other parties discover that the workshop is poorly ventilated, resolve the problem and complete their assembly of the metal box, the Hollow resolves, leaving them unmolested and Blakk with no advantage gained, and a considerable one lost as Blakk's Hollow has little effect on those who've defeated it once before.
