# Blakk's Arsenal Card
Depthstrider Blakk, Rogue Riftlock and former Master of Artifice for a Veiled Daughter enters the battlefield. Their attunement with the Depths and frequent supplication to the Amaranth Sultan through feats of innovation and engineering has granted them a vast, blessed toolbelt of unrivalled versatility. Specializing in command of various technological relics, there is no situation they cannot meet head-on. And when the opportunity arises, they can deploy their foul black ice, and shatter heretical foes with crushing force.

## Loadout
- T1 - Void-Enhanced Armament
	- Taken Armament
		- Martial Arm
		  **Crash Spanner** - Quarterstaff
		  *"Percussive maintenance is the term you're looking for; I am not just 'smashing things'.*"
		  
		  A rough, dark metal spanner roughly the height of it's wielder, carried and used as a quarterstaff. Put into spin, it is capable of delivering crushing blows to man and machine alike.
		  
			- Offensive
			**Gravstrike** - Brch
			*"Force is mass times acceleration."*
			
			Blakk uses their powers of curvature manipulation to rapidly accelerate the end of their weapon, allowing them to inflict brutally crushing blows.
		
		- Defensive
			  **Interceptor Spin**
			  *"I stuck my finger in there once. Still haven't found it."*
			  
			 Blakk throws the Crash Spanner ahead of them and uses curvature manipulation to spin it rapidly in the air, blocking oncoming projectiles. Sturdier attacks can interrupt the spin, and thus it is not effective against them.
		
		- Gifted Arm
		  **Rift Vibrokhopesh** - Curved Sword
		  *"All who say I betrayed the Daughter I served are liars. I was loyal, decorated, and left as such. Here is the proof."*
		  
		  A curved length of hardened pale amara mocks an axeblade as it takes the form of a sword. Along its length are carved scripture from the Depthstone Codices, and its handle, fine leather wrapped around the full-tang crystal. In the hands of a Depthstrider, it strafes this realm and the other.
		  
			- Offensive
			  **Blakkstrikes** - Brch, Cado, Siph, Unrav
			  Axle: Formshift | Re-Innovate
			  *"The Daughter gave me a charge; 'go, show them the depths of the Void, the all-encompassing wrath therein'."*
			  
			  This attack synergizes with Blakk's **Formshift**, and does additional damage based on the number of **innovation charges** that Blakk has accumulated through formshifts, **capped at twenty charges** expended. This strike bypasses and destroys armor, cuts, siphons chalk and suppresses further chalkweaving. It is Blakk's most powerful technique.
			  
			- Utility
			  **Momentum Conduit**
			  *"You know its working when it starts singing."*
			  
			  The Rift Vibrokhopesh shunts constantly between the Dancirah and the Challenger Dark, its blade  thus being a densely-contained piece of crystal with immensely high momentum but little apparent displacement. With a touch, it can impart this momentum on structures sensitive to it.
	
- T2 - Curvature Manipulation
	- Curvature Manipulation
		**Calculated Assembly**
		*"80% of the screws make it into the finished product. A passing grade by all metrics. I pride myself on doing more with less."*
		  
		If Blakk has the component parts, and is aware of the internal workings of an object, such as through a blueprint, they can use their powers of attraction and repulsion to spontaneously assemble it. 
		
		**Calculated Disassembly**
		*"I think we should just outlaw glue actually. I think people who use glue should be forced to drown in the violet."*
		
		If Blakk knows the internal workings of an object, such as through a blueprint. They can use their powers of attraction and repulsion to spontaneously disassemble it.
		
		**Rapid Disassembly**
		*"The road to engineering that lasts is paved with the bodies of apprentices that didn't."*
		
		Blakk is able to use a rough assumption of the innerworkings of something to spontaneously disassemble it in the space of a finger snap. This can result in damage to the workings of the target, however.
		
	- Selective Action
		  **Bangle Box**
		  *"The Daughter's courts enforced a real nuisance of a dress code. I had to wear jewelry. I've never been a fan of it; it's small, fiddly, jams up stuff, and I kept losing it. But this helped."*
		  
		Blakk's Selective Action allows her to filter metal from non-metal, using the divine calculus of the Amaranth Sultan. Metals are attracted to her, and non-metal pushed away.
	
- T3 - Draws from the Void
	- Gifts and Possessions
		**Cache of Contraptions**
		*"A visiting Daughter once asked the one I served, 'What kind of people survive in the Dark?'. The question was posed to me instead. What I said then is what I'll say now; the punchers, the runners, the Void has them plenty, both on the fields and under them. But the thinkers? The thinkers last. I have chosen to be a thinker."*
		
		Lurking just under the local Horizon is Blakk's Cache of Contraptions, their personal toolbelt of answers to every question. By carving a rift and reaching into the depths, they can retrieve a contraption and deploy in battle as they see fit. With their Formshift, they can manipulate the nature of each contraption to ensure they are always ready for whatever the Switchboard brings.
		
		- **Contraption - Strafe Boosters**
		  *"By eliminating the need to walk, we raised workshop efficiency by 35%. The number of workshop incidents increased as well during this period, but I am certain it is unrelated."*
		  
		  Retrofitted Fel-Arcad competitive rocketskates expand upwards to the waist with layered armored plate, spring-reliant shock absorbers, redundant gyro sensors and accelerometers, and high-throughput exhaust vents. With them, Blakk gains considerable mobility.
		  
			- Utility
			  **Cruise Control**
			  *"nnnnnnneeeeaaaAAAARRRROOWWW"*
			  
			  Blakk gains the ability to hover above the ground as well as a considerable boost to speed, allowing them to skate rapidly across the battlefield, repositioning to dodge attacks or launch them.
			  
			- Offensive - Skew
			  **Blast Hack**
			  *"Whiplash builds character."*
			  
			  Additional boosters are fitted to the back of the Strafe Booster assembly, and the internal enginery is replaced with a high-capacity battery. Blakk's hovering and passive mobility are disabled, in favor of bursts of high speed and maneuverability after the battery is charged. For brief moments, Blakk can move at speeds close to that of sound, but they are balanced by downtimes of needing to recharge.
			  
			- Utility - Skew
			 **Featherlight Hack**
			 *"Its both more and less fun than you'd think."*
			 
			 Curvature-inducing retrofits are built into the booster assembly, allowing Blakk to use them to fly. While vertical movement is fairly swift, horizontal movement is mildly curtailed. 
			 
		- **Contraption - Repulsor Plate**
		  *"Its a little heavy on the upper-body, and it certainly isn't the best thing in my wardrobe, but I'd be dead and gone without it."*
		  
		  Depthstone-impregnated particle suspension chambers controlled by proximity sensor lattices, interlaced with chainmail, solid plate and featherlight padding creates a void-attuned breastplate capable of defeating all manners of threats.
		
			- Defensive
			 **Gossamer Barricade**
			 *"I can tune it to even repel air."*
			  
			The Repulsor Plate uses user-tunable threat detection algorithms to induce repulsive pockets of force to repel incoming threats. It boasts considerable utility against projectiles, and even attacking personnel can be kept well beyond arm's length.
			
			 - Offensive - Skew
			**Slam Hack**
			*"It genuinely never stops being funny."*
			   
			The Repulsor Plate is refitted with a battery. When charged, it analyzes all targets in local space and selects according to parameters most likely to be met by a human target. It then induces a considerable repulsive force right under them, launching them into the air, followed by an even more intense attractive force that pulls them back down, slamming them into the ground. This attack has an internal cooldown dictated by the Repulsor Plate's battery.
			
			- Utility - Skew
			**Cloak Hack**
			*"There are times I've used it while sitting at my desk, and watched as people stumble around my office, files in hand, wondering if they should drop them or go look for me. But I usually get caught, often from laughing too hard."*
			
			Local manipulation of air allows for distorting the form, interfering with observation mechanisms ranging from mundane visuals to Chalkweaver Weavesight.
			
		- **Contraption - Assault Gauntlets**
		  *"It's very straightforward."*
		  
		  From the shoulders to the fingertips are reticulated metal plates fastened and layered, servos constraining the imperfect twitches of the arm. Force-multiplying motors grant strength to every movement, and lashed to the forearms are twin-barrel machine guns; the answer to many a stupid question.
		
			- Offensive
			  **Barrage** - Cado, Siph
			  *"Very, very straightforward."*
			  
			  Blakk takes aim and fires a barrage of pale amara projectiles. They pierce and siphon chalk from the targets they strike, empowering Blakk as a denizen of the depths.
			  
			- Offensive - Skew
			  **Napalm Hack** - Induc, Siph
			  *"Let 'em stew.'"*
			  
			  The twin machinegun barrels are cycled out in favor of a nozzle, and a canister is fitted to the back. Blakk can blast dense swathes of incredibly hot flames at close targets, incinerating them and inflicting heavy inductive burn, as well as siphoning their calcic reserves.
			  
			- Offensive - Skew
			  **Railgun Hack** - Brch, Cado, Unrav, Prax
			  Axle: Formshift
			  *"Tuned. Over-tuned possibly. Maybe more than possibly. Almost certainly. I might have been asked to stop using it."*
			  
			  Blakk holds both arms parallel and aims at a target, while the thermal capacitors in the gauntlets begin to charge. At full capacity, they fire a depthstone projectile with ludicrous velocity, piercing and breaching armor and inflicting heavy unravelling on targets hit by it.
			  
			  Additionally, the damage done by the railgun scales with the **hack counter**; the number of active hacks on currently active contraptions. At **five stacks**, the railgun gains a praxis component to its damage, and deals additional damage against **those who hold ill sentiment towards the things of the Void**.
			  
			- Offensive
			  **Hook-shot Hack** - Induc
			  *"If I really focus, I can pluck a hair off a beard. Usually I just break a nose."*
			  
			  The gauntlets are refitted with repulsion-capable apparatus and high-strength chain, allowing for launching the arms and retracting them. Should they strike a target, Blakk can reel them in while they are unable to resist due to a heavy inductive stun. If they fire at an object, they can reel it towards them, or reel themselves towards it.
			 
		- **Contraption - Hyper Visors**
		  *"Helps me keep track of loose screws."*
		  
		  
		- **Contraption - Black Ice Shield**
	- Draw Strike
		  **Hazard Drawer**
	- Formshift
		  **Re-Innovate**
		  *"I was never the best acolyte, but I did what I had to. It's paid off."*
		  
		 Blakk's Formshift allows them to return contraptions in the Cache of the Contraptions after summoning them. When Blakk has no active summons and summons a contraption from their cache, they expend a 'charge' of '**Innovation**'. Blakk permanently has a single charge of Innovation, that is expended when one summoned contraption is active. All of Blakk's contraptions are summoned as **possessions** by default. 
		 
		 However, when Blakk formshifts a contraption in **possession state**, it returns as a **gift from the void**, with a skew known as a **hack**. These hacks alter the **functionality of contraptions** in Blakk's active arsenal, and adds a charge to Blakk's **hack counter**. Additionally, triggering **Re-Innovate** on a contraption **refunds two Innovation charges**, which allows Blakk to summon more contraptions.
		 
		 Thus, when Blakk summons a contraption and Re-Innovates it, the contraption gains a hack and Blakk gains two innovation charges. This allows them to summon two more contraptions. Re-Innovating all three grants all three new hacks and grants six innovation charges. Blakk can **clear the hack** on a contraption in **gift state** (has an active hack) by expending two innovation charges and **taking** the contraption from the Void again as a possession.
		 
		 If Blakk has all five contraptions active, they can Re-Innovate all of them and reap ten Innovation charges, while refreshing the hacks on all. This builds the **innovation counter**, and innovation charges can be expended on powerful attacks.
