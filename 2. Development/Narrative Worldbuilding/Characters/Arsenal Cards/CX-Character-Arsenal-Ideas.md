## #1: Red Weftworks
Tek-based power that allows for massive compression of the potential strait, allowing all chalk fed to the computational strait to be fed as **hyperweave**. It takes on an uncharacteristic red hue (relevant to the character) and allows for high-octane energy blast style chalkweaving.

## #2: Tats and Brands
Tek-based power revolving around hyper-compressed rituals that can be placed on calcic entities. Wielders manifest needle like extensions on their fingers that allow for deposition of colored chalk and the formation of rituals. Tats or tattoos can be placed on the caster and allies to give positive effects, while brands are forced on enemies and inflict maluses.
