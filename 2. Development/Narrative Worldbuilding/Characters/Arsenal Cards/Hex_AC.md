# Arsenal Card: Doctor Ellaine Hex
Pale Amaran, Doctor, and flux diver Ellaine Hex earned a name for themselves in the events of the KosakaWorks Catastrophe, where they emerged from the depths of the Void with the crystal-hewn mark of old devils and the eyes of an old god. Inspired by the actions of the Witch of Gates and her coven, combined with their study of the finer intricacies of all things calcic, this strider of hard lines wields both white and black, realized as their mastery over **hyperweave** and their lattice-melting **witchfire**.

## T1 - Polarized Armaments
### Woven Armaments - White
**Yama Cutter** - Longsword
*"The Stardrip Cycle is a magnificent thing; right there in the Void, pure chalk unimaginable, spilling from cracks and erupting from the Onina. I had doubted the Current theory, but not anymore."*
	Chalk folded and folded and folded in upon itself until it becomes a length of pure potential, densely packed to reach unrivalled hardness, and honed by the caustic depths to lacerating sharpness. With it, Ellaine cuts through foe and falsehood alike.

- Offensive
**Yama Cutter: Flux Strikes** - Cado, Unrav
*"At the intersection of consistency and competence does mastery lie."*
	Ellaine forms the Yama Cutter and unleashes a barrage of strikes, rapidly dissipating and reforming the blade as they go. Targets attempt to block strikes that are not coming, and fail to intercept those that are. 

- Defensive
**(N/A)**

- Utility
**Yama Cutter: Haruspex** - Prax
Axle: Tek | Lesser Eye of Shadri
*"Determining who and what were responsible for Kosaka was a simple matter."*
	Ellaine reshapes their Yama Cutter to weave into the memory and interface straits of a target. When the target speaks, and there is discrepancy between the memory and interface straits, the Yama Cutter conveys it to Ellaine.

### Stolen Armaments - Black
**Amaranthite Coronet** - Dagger - Latticegraft
*"My time in the Challenger Dark has made me wonder if the greatest science is done under the prospect of death."*
	Done in an act of haste and desperation, jagged juts of starlight and dark were rammed into the skull of the fallen flux diver. For days, they lay in the pits of Isalveh and suffered, as their lattice wrestled against the encroaching night. But in time, the plasticity of these things won, and Ellaine emerged, not as a friend of the depths or a foe, but something between. Understood now as the mark of something that scorned divinity, their violet crystalline horns jut from their temples, anointing a ring around their skull as a crown.

- Offensive
**Spiraling Charge** - Cado, Brch, Comp
*"The beasts of Isalveh dictated the rules of battle. And so I learned."*
	Ellaine can perform a charge, leaping at its apex to spin and gore a target with their crystalline horns, doing heavy piercing damage and breaching armor. On strike, they are afflicted with Ellaine's **witchfire**, which burns away at their computational strait and inhibits their ability to strategize, perform advanced techniques of either white or black, and exercise various mental faculties.

- Defensive
**(N/A)**

- Utility
**Polar Fluxshift**
*"Even as they ate away at all that I am, I recognized the metamorphosis for what it was. And when I understood it, the pain became... almost warm."*
	The amaranthite horns atop the head of the doctor allow for additional passive enhancements to their arsenal;
	- Enables dynamically switching the extent of their polar alignment towards white or black. This allows them to wield either T3 White and T2 Black, or T3 Black and T2 White abilities at will, but not simultaneously. 
	- It allows them to cast **horizon rituals** at **quiK** speed.

## T2 - Polar White
### Spectrum Strike
**Yama Cutter: Perfect Strikes** - Cado, Brch, Unrav
Axle: Tainted Tek | Lesser Eye of Shadri
*"Let me show you what I have learnt."*
	The Eye of Shadri taken from the Void has granted Ellaine enhanced Weavesight, allowing them to peer deep into the workings of all things calcic. With their Perfect Strikes, they can accumulate chalk from the Stardrip Cycle, and empower the Yama Cutter to cut through chalk phenomena, including living targets, hurled attacks, relics and rituals. The effect varies, but in some sense they are rendered inert and incapable of harm for a moment if they are able to self-correct, or entirely if not.

**Yama Cutter: Vlad Strikes** - Cado, Siph
Axle: Spectrum Charge | Witchfire Synthesis
*"Know that the path understanding is rife with blades and poisons. Many of them are wielded by you, against yourself."*
	Ellaine forms the Yama Cutter and enchants it with their witchfire setting it to violet blaze. Targets struck are afflicted with devouring witchfire, that eats away at their calcic potential and siphons it to Ellaine. 

### Spectrum Charge
**Witchfire Synthesis** - Imbue - Comp
*"What I used before being taking the Eyes of Shadri. From ashes I obtained understanding."*
	Ellaine's witchfire burns bright and violet, attacking and consuming the computational straits of all it touches, rendering them incapable of higher function. Functioning as an imbue, with either a free hand or their amaranthite horns, they are able to gradually weave chalk into witchfire, this witchfire being usable as a component in their horizon ritualism. 

### Spectrum Shift
**Witchsteps**
*"A quirk of the Void is that there are depths deeper than deep, and darkness that is darker than dark. To escape shadow, you must dive into deeper shadow."*
	At will, Ellaine can shift partially into the Void from the Dancirah, or partially into the Dancirah from the Void. Delving under the metaphorical puddle allows them to dodge or mitigate the severity of attacks, due to exposing less of their profile in the plane where the attack takes place.

## T3 - Polar White
### Tainted Tek
**Lesser Eye of Shadri**
*"The worst and best aspect of the Void was how closely it resembled my desk at home; utter chaos with flecks of meaning sprinkled between. When I found myself lost, I needed a way to discern a path. It was this way in my studies, and it was this way in the Dark as well."*

In the times of the Danseers and the battles against the Minds, the Skydancers reigned over the Starwylds, and on star-gifted wings did they traverse its span. Skydancer Shadri, Keeper of Ledgers, found themselves thirsty for discovery, and sought to learn of the entirety of the Dancirah in her lifetime. They did so by purging their eyes, in exchange for a new kind of sight; weave infused with their mandate, eyes that traversed the length of the Wylds, transmitting back all they discovered to the mistress sitting atop the high tower.

When the Refrain claimed the Danseers, the Eyes of Shadri were lost to the depths of the Dancirah, some captured in Vaults, others obliterated by the scorching law stars, more still encased in wellsprings to not be seen for thousands of processions. But some found their ways into the hands of the many denizens of the Switchboard, granting them a sight beyond mere sight.

But Ellaine's differs, in that it passed through the flux storms and the Challenger Horizon, becoming suffused with the caustic stardrip. It did not stop them from coming to wield it however, suspending the eye of the fallen Skydancer between the apex of their horns, a second mouth through which they drank of the world around them.

Allows;
- Enhanced Weavesight
- Understanding the weave mechanics of anything she sees
- Enhanced navigation
- Hyperweaving
- Stacks of inquiry, usable in ritualism

## T2 - Polar Black
### Point Collapse
**(N/A)**
*"Too indelicate a power; it is not to my liking."*

### Point Expulsion
**(N/A)**
*"Too indelicate a power; it is not to my liking."*

## T3 - Polar Black
### Plunder from the Void
Riftlock

## T4 - Conjoined Polarity
### Horizon Ritualism
Ellaine's witchworks
- Ayu's curse
- Ayu's ward
- Ayu's grace


### Aural Riposte
**Yama Cutter: Realmstrikes** - Cado, Siph, Unrav(W-B), Comp(B-W)
Axle: Spectrum Shift | Witchsteps
*"There was a moment where, at the top of the tallest Onina in Isalveh, I pierced the Horizon and felt instantly the low hum of the Astrolabe. It told me what I already knew; that great truths lay in the Void, and they had scarred me for all to see."*
	When transiting from the Dancirah to Isalveh or vice versa, Ellaine is able to make an attack upon emerging, a flurry of lacerating cuts that siphon power from their targets, unravel or sunder their computational lines based on the direction of transit, and replenish **witchfire** for them.

## T5 - Full Spectra
**HEXBLAST** - Cado, Brch, Comp, Unrav
*"It was when I stared into the eyes of the one who ran Kosaka at the time that I confronted a final truth; there are simply those incapable of computing the minds of others. It is this inability to build a model of minds different from your own, that sits at the root of the stars' many evils."*
	With complete control of white and black, and balance between the sky and the deep, Ellaine conjures a sphere of immense altitude and another of extreme depth, and superimposes them upon each other, forming the HEXBLAST. In its formation, both spheres are subject to considerable fluctuating randomness, causing the HEXBLAST to rapidly flux and destabilize with time. Anything caught in the volume of the HEXBLAST is rapidly shunted back and forth between the Dancirah and Isalveh, to varying degrees each time, resulting in all things - man, technique, geography - being shredded across planes.

On Cast;
"Spherical depth manifestation; black, spherical reverse-depth manifestation; white. Achieve superposition. Come forth! Full Spectra Hexblast!"
