# The Strider Starsailors (PHldr.)
The five most legendary Striders in modern history, distinguishing themselves through exploits throughout the Switchboard. From their ranks came the Witch of Gates, who's unmatched doctrine led to the rise of the Mystics, and the collapse of Strider society. 

## Synopsis
The Academy needed a strike team of powerful Striders to undergo dangerous sojourns across the Switchboard, these operations coordinated by **Combined Strider Operations**, the Academy's spec-ops division that serves a range of purposes, spanning research, development, paramilitary offensives, search and rescue, search and destroy, vault raiding/search and retrieve and Esoteric Ops, a broad category of high-risk operations dealing with the more unsavory ramifications of the information tangible universe. 

Not much of a selection process was in place, and it could very well be said the Academy kept throwing Striders at problems and took notes of the ones that failed and lived to come back, or succeeded. Inevitably, the survivors found themselves working together more frequently, and in that, began succeeding more frequently even on riskier missions. With success came repute, then fame, then lauding and adoration, and the inevitable elevation to mythical status as the Striders who could not be lost or fail. They displayed mastery over the Sky. They became those who could chart any path through the Stars of the Switchboard; the Starsailors.

	In the canon, before the events of the Post-Mysticism, Salyne Khateleya went insane through her delving into the Mysticism, and the rest of the Starsailors, Combined Strider Ops and many other parties had to work to stop her and her Mystics. These events are what brought about the collapse of Strider Society.  

## The Starsailors
Each earned a title for themselves through the mechanics of [[The Doctrine of Passing#On Names and Tales|yarns and titles]], reflecting the powers they obtained or forged, uniting them with their own skills, tools and experience into unique manners of engagement.

### 1. Adven Ventura, Strider Sojourner
Their leader is **Adven Ventura**, the Strider Sojourner who focused on honing the more elementary Strider powers, learning deep rituals and perfecting his abilities as an Augmenter Tek caster. By virtue of sheer discipline his Strider Protocol is the fastest, and his sense of navigation unrivalled, earning him the title and titular powers of 'Sojourner'. 

#### Powers
His relic is a modified iteration of the CARP-XXX equation woven into a handgun, optimized for accuracy, his proficiency with it further enhanced by his Tek that allows turns mundane physical abilities into miracles. As an Augmenter, he can also enhance the skills of Striders fighting alongside him, such as enhancing their ability to accumulate chalk, or the speed of their Stride.

Ventura's true power stems from his knowledge and mastery over a library of powerful rituals, that allow him to perform feats far beyond the power of his relic and Tek. Most commonly used is his '**Ritual of Negation**', that loads his handgun with lattice-destroying rounds specifically designed to defeat Striders.

His most prominent area of lack is in usage of the Flash Protocol, which he can only cast and maintain for just above a second. Working with this limitation however, he uses the Flash Protocol to overcharge his Tek and relic, allowing him to calculate and fire inconceivable shots, making extensive use of ricocheting shots off surfaces.

#### Nature
Ventura is a follower of the teachings of the Silk-strider Goldman and the Silken Writ, principles that guide his actions to be noble, brave and decently righteous, without compromising on brutality and decisiveness when necessary. He values very much the symbolisms of Stridership; respect for the King of Roads and travelling in general, idolization of the Switchboard Sky, and discontentment towards what has already been achieved or discovered, working constantly towards further achievement and further discovery.
