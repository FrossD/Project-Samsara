# Character Sheet Template
This doc will outline the actual template with which we will construct the various characters in the Samsara universe. It will function via various subheadings that deal with characteristics
of each character (appearance, allegiances, ambitions, etc.) and filling those in accordingly.

	- Height and Weight
	- Age
- Background
	- Place of Birth
	- Family (of birth)
	- Education
	- Occupation
	- Social Stature
	- History and Feats

	- Ambitions
	- Biases and Prejudices
	- Complexes(?)
	- Values
	- 'Political' and 'Religious' beliefs

	- Intelligence
	- Wisdom

**Rough Two: Switchboard Specific**

## Combat Classification
As outlined in [[On Weave and Warfare]], Striders have various means of engaging each other in combat, distinct enough to all categorization of them according to their means of doing so. 

| Vertex        | Eng. Range | Eng. Method             | Casting Disc.        | Esoteric Powers |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| Chalkstriders | CQCs       | Relic Fighter           | (Tek Cat.) Caster    | Mystic(?)       |
| Depthstriders | Duelists   | Relic Caster            | (Tek Cat.) Ritualist | Clocker         |
| Mystic        | Ranger     | Pure Caster             | Ritualist            |                 |
|               |            | Chalkweaver             |                      |                 |
|               |            | Chalkagnostic/Kinticist |                      |                 |

This table is *heavily* inconclusive. Revisit soon for further work.

# Legacy
## Character Vault
### The 'Shinies'
**Legacy Members Restructuring**
Restructuring all legacy members to reach a more coherent total of characters.
- Cryogen (Ventura) 
- Fyresworde (Pyre)
- Hexagonelle (Ellaine Hex)
- Walrus (Russel Walls) [Unrevealed]
- Grace (Lucrecia Vanitas) [Unrevealed]

### The 'Overclockers'
Doctor Hex's old crew of Overclockers. Clocking and the Clockers themselves are getting full narrative reworks. That said, these names can make it to the actual work fairly unchanged.
- Vansa Vanitas
- ~~Sabaism Iris~~ (No longer tied to this character; name has been used elsewhere)
- Bryanar Spartan

### Academy Professors
As above, can remain fairly unchanged, making their way into the work fairly unchanged.
- Randal Zenith 
- Sergei (Needs a first/last name)
- Tetravaan Kalstaff (Too baller a name to be tied to a character without even a definite purpose; change is under consideration)
