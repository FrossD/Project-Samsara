# The WN-DT: World Narrative Drafting Table
**"Onwards, sunwards!"**

The World Narrative Drafting Table; staging grounds for the work on the Switchboard's history, characters and lore. Here, drafts for new documents will be synthesized and realized into completed works.

This doc has a somewhat loose tagging system in play for the various entries, describing whether they are related to the **Pure Worldbuilding (pWB)**, **Narrative Worldbuilding (nWB)** or the **Pure Narrative (pNt)**. Additionally headings are further divided into classes Alpha and Beta, as a way of expressing their urgency.

## Work: Rapid Iteration
A small space for quickly rebuilding docs that have been changed as a result of considerable additions or modifications to other canon.
- [x] Nuthin'

## Work: Questions
A bank of questions relevant to ongoing development.
- [x] Nuthin'


## Work: Active Development
A staging ground for work currently in progress. Tasks here are often new. 

### Transcribing
Works are paper drafted in the notebook, and then transferred here so they may begin the long process of iterative hell.
- [ ] Nuthin'

- (nWB) **The Fel-Arcad**.
	- Pending.

### Ongoing Development
Entries and docs here are actively under development, and just under transcribing they are the highest priority work in Samsara. 

#### Class Alpha - High Priority
- [ ] Nuthin'

- (nWB) **The Fel-Arcad Family**
	- Get to the government system and fast.
		- Get to the court system and fast too. Research difference between civil and criminal suits and courts in general.

#### Class Beta - Reduced Priority
- [x] Nuthin'

## Work: Revisions & Restructuring
Revisions to existing canon, and the restructuring of existing documents to more useable formats. Entries under here are slightly less urgent than those in active development, but works here cannot be neglected as they often appear hear due to errors in continuity between old canon and new.

### Revisions
Revisions to existing canon, particularly with the aim of reconciling old canon with newer additions to Project Samsara.

#### Class Alpha - High Priority
- [ ] Nuthin'

- (nWB, pWB) **Slates**
	- A lookover of Slates and computers in the Switchboard.
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU_YFpfDqqA

#### Class Beta - Reduced Priority
- [x] Nuthin'

### Restructuring
Structural rebuilds of some documents, necessary when they grow particularly long, asking for a rebuild of the headings tree, or tentative consideration of whether some documents should be merged into one or existing documents be broken down into multiple smaller ones.

#### Class Alpha - High Priority
- [ ] Nuthin'

- (meta) **Amendment to Family Template**: Under [[FamTemplate]]
	- 'Individuals and Families' and 'Respect and Hierarchies' are revised subheadings. Review the questions under each to add questions relevant to Individuals for the former, and societal hierarchies for the latter.
	- Revise 'Taboos and Superstitions' to 'Quirks'. Get ChatGPT to comment on that one.
		- Update this constructor with relevant questions as well.


#### Class Beta - Reduced Priority
- [ ] Nuthin'

- (meta) **Vault-wide Rebuild of Text Formatting**
	- A vault-wide rebuild of how text is formatted in the vault, using isolated tabs before text to show **my thoughts** and greater than indents to show **additional details or footnotes**.

## Work: Backburner Development
Ongoing work, but not as urgent, often due to subject matter or dependency upon other uncompleted docs.

### Expansion Sites
Entries under here are either existing but fairly undeveloped documents, or existing, developed documents but have a bit further to go before they reach true conclusion, often because they hinge on various other works that need completion, or are simply currently in the spotlight of 'worldbuilding-creep'.

#### Class Alpha - High Priority
- [ ] Nuthin'

- (pWB) **Calcimistry**: Under [[Calcimistry]]
	- **PROPOSAL**: Macroscopic Material Properties, handled in [[Prop.CalcicChemistry]], all properties of all things in the Switchboard arise by virtue of chalk weave. This proposal will be appended to [[The Hands as Chalk]] and be linked to [[Switchboard Technology#SBTech: Mechanical, Manufacturing and Heavy Technology |SB Tech Materials Science]].  
	- Awaiting Hex's response to [[Post-Proposal Notes]].
		- Hex's response is that we need an explanation for how light works. 
	- Ask them what they meant by 'walls'.

#### Class Beta - Reduced Priority
- [ ] Nuthin'

- (pWB) **Rework Line Arms** under [[On Weave and Warfare]] when our physics system is back up and running.

- (nWB) **VoiFleur Development**: Under [[The Voice in Flowers]]
	- ~~Shove Fauna in the Switchboard under here.~~ Create Fauna in the Switchboard doc and place [[The EPIT]] under it.
	- As a note, it is strange for the Switchboard to have only flowers in the sense of something you pick from the ground. Add a modifier to the table that defines if the flower is picked from the ground or a shrub as the name implies, or grows on a tree, or from an animal in the Switchboard.
	- Expand this into the entire flora of the Switchboard
	- Might be worth ripping from Starbound again lmao.
	- Either that or use the names from all the people I'm coming up with for the canon.

- (pWB) **Further on SBTech Materials**: Under [[Switchboard Technology]]
	- Further material dev; wood, fabrics/textiles, gemstones and crystallines. Possibly ceramics, polymers, composites, nanomaterials and semiconductors. 
	- This stuff works pretty well now that we have a somewhat fully fledged [[Calcimistry|Calcic Chemistry]] system in the works. Property weave solves a bunch of our problems regarding how different tiers of materials differ from each other.

- (pWB, nWB) **Void 5.0**: Under [[The Challenger Dark]], [[The Void]], [[The Vahnkin]]
	- **The Void** serves as something close to a religion. It will have a 'holy book' (canon, codex, blah blah) and an origin story on the Vahn and the wielders of Void. The original Vahn had two wives, one with a Hungering Eye, and one with a Weeping Eye. They are the precursors of Avarice and Nugatory. Work from there.
	- Ordained Vahnkin having religious-adjacent titles.
	- Negative Information ([Write up sent by Hex](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/oppenheim/negative-information_p2.html))
	- Update [[Prop.Blackjack]] and other Void documents where necessary with the concept of **Skews**, slight 'changes' added to things Given by or Taken from the Void, decided and placed there by the working's of Brother Vahn's **Anchor Variables**.
	- Consider moving the Void related sections in [[The Skywards Pursuit]] to their own doc and link them back to SkyPur.
	- Merge [[Prop.Blackjack]] and [[The Void]] as an update to 'The Void as a Being'

### Synthesis Sites
Entries here have left the Thoughts Repository, and are confirmed to be entering the Samsara canon in some way.

#### Class Alpha - High Priority
- [ ] Nuthin'

#### Class Beta - Reduced Priority
- [ ] Nuthin'
- (pNt) **Trevelyan**: Under [[C4-Organizations]]
	- Trevelyan, the Traveling Mage and his 99 Tales. His Tek is that he cannot die from conventional means, and as such he has appeared in many places in Switchboard canon. Most noteworthy are his 99 Tales, stories compiled by him that inspire the followers of Trevelyan.
	- Also a Danseer.

- (pNt) **Kei Vollerei**: Under [[C1-A1B1-Protags]]
	- Begin work on the Evangelist Strider Supremacist.

- (nWB) **Class Weapons**: Under [[On Weave and Warfare]]
	- Pale Amarans need one as well, preferably a '**paired arm**' weapon as that occupies a space on the spectrum not taken by Glaives and Quarterstaffs.
	- Consider Kingdom of Amalur's [faeblades](https://amalur.fandom.com/wiki/Faeblades).

- (nWB) **The Academies Plural**: Under [[C4-Organizations]]
	- While Spyndl was the first Academy and thus the most prestigious, various other allied and rivalling schools exist throughout the Switchboard, with their own histories, doctrines and methodologies.
	- For now, directly rivalling Spyndl is **Sakerfel**, a Rosenthalist-run academy that has very poor relations with the Sil'khan.

- (nWB, pNt) **EPIT 'The Lustrous'**: Under [[The EPIT]]
	- Things do not truly die in the Switchboard; the Current ensures this. All there ever will be already is, and all that there is was once before. The desire to exist vastly outstrips the power to end existence.
	- 'Lustrous' is a placeholder name for a larger, far more prominent 'enemy faction' in the Switchboard.
	- Their motif from now borrows from a number of sources;
		- Destiny 2's original ''**moth people**'' concept art; [Destiny Concept Art by Daniel Chavez | Concept Art World](https://conceptartworld.com/news/destiny-concept-art-by-daniel-chavez/)
		- Starbound's **Saturnians and Thaumoths**; [The Saturnians | Chucklefish Forums (playstarbound.com)](https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/the-saturnians.4918/)
		- This random **World Anvil** link; [4.4 - Saturnian / Thaumoth Species in Astral Confined | World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/astral-confined-elcadrane/a/44----saturnian-2F-thaumoth-article)
		- They have a moth motif of sorts.
	- I had the snap idea for spider-themed people relating to the whole 'weave' motif that permeates Samsara.
		- Light and Weave are perhaps their motifs? Stars and the Current?
	- Their origin is somewhat related to the Minds.
		- Another idea is that they are the Kin 3.5; the result of an Astrolabic resolution that for reasons, flew under the radar. 

## Work: Thoughts Repository
Thoughts and new concepts to incorporate into the Samsara canon. While thoughts had are stored here, they may not necessarily make it into the Samsara canon.

**Strider 'Casualism'**
- A document on **speaking in the Switchboard**. Speech **patterns and slang** employed by those dwelling in the Switchboard.
- Scintillate; a 'neutered' form of Glass used as a drug by Striders.
- The Red Pleasures of Leilani; the doc on Switchboard vices.
- Something about Strider 'casualism', talking about some of the quirkier bits of Strider existence and the like, custom around smoking, alcohol, games shit.

**Tongues of the Switchboard**
- The Sil'khan unintentionally formed a tongue of their own, the **Starwyld Common** or **Starwyl**, that came to major use among the Switchboard's many nomads, drifters, outlaws, mercenaries, the Sil's own Sabai, malcontents and rogues. Contrasted with the NDS, it is said to be spoken sharply, crassly, and hurriedly, with many verbal timesavers and a noteworthy hand component that allows for skewing the context of a verbal statement, adding additional meaning, or weaving in a layer of subterfuge in the presence of those who aren't familiar with it.

**Sentiments**
- 1 Timothy 4:13-14
- The defining line of the book(?); tradition is not the worship of ashes, but the preservation of fire.
- "Fear the wrath of the patient man, and respect the elder in a profession where men die young."
- Dare mighty things.
- Love Elementalism: [https://www.vxtiktok.com/t/ZPR7mL1PT/](https://www.vxtiktok.com/t/ZPR7mL1PT/ "https://www.vxtiktok.com/t/ZPR7mL1PT/")

**Nomenclature**
- Names are needed for the various tech professionals in ICT.
- Consider renaming Skydancer Cicerone to Cicere.

**Tentative Narrative**
- **Ellaine Hex**; ~~non-Strider, becomes Strider somehow. Walks the hated path. Meets the King of Roads somehow.~~ Probably not lol.

- **Russel Walls** has a crew of people that support his ideals.

- **Russel Walls** plot point related to The Lattice as a Canvas; in his quest to become the Strider Exalted, he seeks to become More using the doctrine of Subjugation, which entails the replacement of lattice with 'higher' chalk, be it chrome or something above that.

- **New Valkyjria 2.0**; Draft a new model of the city centered around the bi-furcated model; the Fel-Arcad arcology in the more temperate north, and the actual city in the desert south.
	- Southern Desert Zone (SDZ) and the Northern Arcadia Zone (NAZ).
	- City One (Industrial, rural, more southern), City Two (High tech Urban, Less southern) in the SDZ
	- Fel-Arcad arcology in the NAZ

**Miscellaneous**
- A document on the various **aesthetics and design languages** in the Switchboard. Something like 'Switchboard Aesthetics'
	- Big data in the Switchboard; everything being ribbon means that data centers in the Switchboard can look like giant textile mills. Ribbon can be kept in solid state storage like giant spools of thread, unwound into computational technology
	- Very cool aesthetic of Strider technology being a mix of centralized computing reliant on botanical structure, where server rooms better resemble looms. 
	- This stuff will likely be discussed in each individual Family's Iconography sections.
	- Addresses Strider dressing perhaps? Though this will far more likely be done in the family doc for the Sil'khan.

- An addition to a hypothetical doc outlining the **equipment carried by Striders**; a sort of 'case' for carrying cloth analogue, used by Striders to carry strips of woven chalk, which they can use in various applications.

- X,Y and Z axis for something; the zen-harmonius, zen-melodic and zen-(something). Just sounds cool; literally have no idea what to turn this into. 

- Skydancer doctrines upheld by their apostolics.

- 'HALOS' or 'Handcannon Longsword', the most elementary weapon loadout used by Academy Operatives.

- Maybe relate Teks in some way to the Vermeil?

- An elementary numbers system built from the y-naming;
1. fa
2. wa
3. je
4. kan
5. rin
6. ji
7. ta
8. san
9. jo
10. run

- Develop a language or at least an alphabet system.

### The Samsara Grid-sheet
![[SamsaraExcel.xlsx]]

### 'Y-naming'
The Y-naming is a means devised to facilitate the naming of concepts, entities, phenomena and the like within the Switchboard and Samsara canon, using modifications of words translated from **English** to **Yoruba** (hence the 'Y').

The employment of Y-naming first of all allows for the creation of a linguistic 'baseplate' from which deviations can be made without them sounding overwhelmingly derived from English irrespective of how much scrambling and shuffling of letters is employed. There is simply very little that can be developed in even days of pondering that can sound or function as desirably as an actual language which was evolved over the course of multiple centuries.

The application of Y-naming is fairly simple; run a translate to fetch the 'Y-alt' of the word, and then employ a collection of developed of rules that allows it to translate and slot in to the Samsara canon. These rules are very 'not' hard and fast, with rules developed and employed on the spot and most boiling down to what rolls off the tongue the best now, and will still sound as they are needed to days, weeks, thousands and tens of thousands of words down the line. It is the very definition of winging it, but only the truly learned and eagle eyed will ever be able to suspect what is at play, much less reverse-engineer it.

The actual rules employed then, are ones of target and context; where we choose to employ Y-naming and the context of it. 

We typically apply Y-naming when what needs naming is of 'cultural' origin or significance, such as a food, position in a royal court, or a phenomena first observed by a specific people. So while Y-naming may be used to name something like a waterfall, it would be strange to use it to name a piece of software. That said, this is also not a hard and fast rule - as just off the top of my head - the Breach Protocol could be called the 'Botini'; many keys, referring to it's ability to defeat all manners of doors. There is a rule about specifically 'Botini' that will be elaborated upon later.

The second rule - that of context - is one that we'll see employed mostly in matters relating to the progenitor families, all of which possess decently hard rules about how names are structured. Y-alts of names are subjected to these rules to produce a result that sounds similar to other Y-alts of names relating to that family. Subjective similarity between names in this way produces visible identity and differentiation. 

The third rule, described partially above the section mentioning the first two semi-hard rules, can be called the 'tongue-rule'. The Y-alts of some words simply do not sit well on the tongue, or roll off it neatly as would be liked - such as 'Botini' above. The usage of random letters to add grease to some letters and grit to others is employed, and is often just a task of bouncing syllables and sounds off the walls until something sticks.

The general methodology is as such;
1. Determine if the Y-naming is to be used
2. If yes, fetch the Y-alt
3. Employ the tongue-rule as needed
4. Employ contextual rules
5. Employ the tongue rule again if needed

I could give examples, but no one is likely to see this section but me. When the Y-naming is used, it'll often be mentioned.

### The Grid
The Grid is something I employed unknowingly in [[The Voice in Flowers]]. Put most simply, it is a means of creating a large swathe of unique but related entitles by defining parameters and expanding on what forms at the intersection of these parameters.

An example;

|       | Weapons | Cooking Utensils |
| ----- | ------- | ---------------- |
| Sharp | Sword   | Knife            |
| Blunt | Club    | Meat Tenderizer  |
|       |         |                  |

The Grid thus helps in simply defining what needs to be created, by first defining the hedge within it operates. Before we can create specificity, we must first obtain broad parameters and 'cross' them, and at the cross product of the common does the unique emerge.

### Milestone V1P0
**Milestone V1P0** or **Samsara v1.0** (**V** **1** **P**oint **0**), is a major milestone in the Samsara project that describes a means of demarcating progress made in Samsara development - development that will begin to take place after the establishment of the **Core Samsara Sandbox**, which is what the final document stack will be called somewhat around the time we begin work on the pNarrat - in other words, after the completion of the pWB and NarratWB. 

Major and minor expansions upon the Core Sandbox will be indicated by the increasing version number, meant to denote this progress and development being made. As such, it becomes simpler to describe and track iterations of Samsara as it grows even after the completion of its core foundation.

This in particular helps in distribution, and the adaptation of Samsara into different forms. There is a dream of mine - a distant one yes, but such is the nature of dreams - that there is a tabletop game built upon the Samsara canon, and players issue lines such as "Oh this is built upon Samsara v1.12's mechanics." and "When will they move to SaraV2 already?"

The distribution part of it excites me the most. The ability for others to set their own tales in the Samsara universe, and have these tales have as accurate to the universe's mechanics due to having those mechanics on hand is thrilling, and will foster perhaps the first of the Samsara fan works to exist.

Soon.

Of course, it's still quite far away. And yet it is strangely nearer than we think. All it takes is more work, harder work, better work.
