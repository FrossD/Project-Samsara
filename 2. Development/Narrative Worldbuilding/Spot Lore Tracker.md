# Spot Lore Tracker
In developing many other docs, workable lore that can even make it to final iterations are created on the spot. This is a doc for tracking them, based on the document of their origin, and their final destinations.

[[Martial Disciplines of the Switchboard]]
- **Rosenthalist faction known as the Roslettes**
	- Practice the Roslette Style
	- Very much implied to be your usual mob/crime family
	- Have the idea they've infiltrated much of Fel-Arcad society
- **Fel-Arcad ceremonies make use of the felkr weapons**
	- Worth mentioning in the Rituals and Periodicals section of the Fel-Arcad document
- **Cyrculian Bluescor**; the first named bit of named alcohol in the Switchboard
	- Demands a little story behind it
	- Cyrcul is an astrolabic region
	- Lancaster Innovations, but their fine goods department
- The first bit of **Trevelyan Lore** here
	- Very essential to refer back here in the building of [[Prop.SpyndlNoon]]
	- There's a disconnect between the portrayal of Trevelyan here and the story of Trevelyan in Spyndl Noon; to rectify that I had the idea of the 99 Tales being completed and the 100th Tale being Trevelyan's mind finally coming undone due to the damage of the Refrain, and him needing to be put down for it
	- Trevelyan's Trevelers do it. It's a sad tale.

[[On Weave and Warfare]]
- Some lore on the **Antamaran versus the Vahnkin** under the Pale Amaran felkrivft weapons 
	- Part of a much larger series of Sky versus Deep conflicts.
	- Expand upon.

[[Communications and Compute]]
- The **Vitric Boundary** is the Shelf-Dancirah equivalent of the Challenger Horizon, except that it cannot be crossed the way the Horizon can, except through the jaws.
- Lore about the various **organizations that control the DevitNet**.
- The Vermeilion Compute Society (VCS) and the Vermeilion Interdiction Research Foundation (VIRF) formed in the days of the Praxis Conflicts, under the Spyndl Academy.
- *The Writ of the Eater* and a second book on the mechanics of Kache Krashing were authored by Skydancer Ryjik and the apostolic Eaters of Ryjik respectively.

[[Chalk Ritualism]]
- Sil'khan were taught various ritual hand seals by Skydancer Nefele.
