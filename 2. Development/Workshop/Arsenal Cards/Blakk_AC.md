# Arsenal Card: Riftlock Blakk
Depthstrider Blakk, Rogue Riftlock and former Master of Artifice for a Veiled Daughter enters the battlefield. Her attunement with the Depths and frequent supplication to the Amaranth Sultan through feats of innovation and engineering has granted her a vast, blessed toolbelt of unrivalled versatility. Specializing in command of various **technological relics**, there is no situation she cannot meet head-on. And when the opportunity arises, she can deploy their foul **black ice**, and shatter heretical foes with crushing force.

## T0 - Martial Disciplines
Service in the Void and the Daughter's courts has exposed the Riftlock Blakk to a variety of the Void's disciplinary offerings, and going rogue has made them privy to a fair bit more. Favoring the brutality that overt measures allow, Blakk has translated this to their martial doctrines. A long life spent in workshops, however, has worked against them in this respect.

### Innate
**(N/A)**

### Practiced
- The Path of Oninan Monks and Giants - **Oninan Path**
*"It translated surprisingly well to swinging oversized wrenches."*

- The Methods of Travelling Savants - **Trevelyan's Principles on Confrontation**
*"I fancy myself a Treveler of sorts, a traveling tinker, a purveyor of all things odd and mechanical."*

### Novice
- Vahnkin Infantry Weapons and Warfare Doctrine - **Vahnkin War-making**
*"I value it more so for how it has exposed me to battle in general."*

## T1 - Void-Enhanced Armament
### Given Armament
**Rift Vibrokhopesh** - Curved Sword
*"All who say I betrayed the Daughter I served are liars. I was loyal, decorated, and left as such. Here is the proof."*
	A curved length of hardened pale amara mocks an axeblade as it takes the form of a sword. Along its length are carved scripture from the Depthstone Codices, and its handle, fine leather wrapped around the full-tang crystal. In the hands of a Depthstrider, it strafes this realm and the other.

- Offensive
**Blakkstrikes** - Brch, Cado, Siph, Unrav
Axle: Formshift | Re-Innovate
*"The Daughter gave me a charge; 'go, show them the depths of the Void; the all-encompassing wrath therein'."*
	This attack synergizes with Blakk's **Formshift**, and does additional damage based on the number of **innovation charges** that Blakk has accumulated through formshifts, **capped at twenty charges** expended. This strike bypasses and destroys armor, cuts, siphons chalk and suppresses further chalkweaving. **It is Blakk's most powerful technique**.
 
- Utility
**Momentum Conduit**
*"You know it's working when it starts singing."*
	 The Rift Vibrokhopesh shunts constantly between the Dancirah and the Challenger Dark, its blade thus being a densely-contained piece of crystal with immensely high momentum but little apparent displacement. With a touch, it can impart this momentum on structures sensitive to it. The momentum with which the Rift Vibrokhopesh vibrates **scales** with the **hack counter**.

### Taken Armament
**Crash Spanner** - Quarterstaff
*"Percussive maintenance is the term you're looking for; I am not just 'smashing things'.*"
	A rough, dark metal spanner roughly the height of it's wielder, carried and used as a quarterstaff. Put into spin, it is capable of delivering crushing blows to man and machine alike.
 
- Offensive
**Gravstrikes** - Brch
*"Force is mass times acceleration."*
	Blakk uses their powers of curvature manipulation to rapidly accelerate the end of their weapon, allowing them to inflict brutally crushing blows.

- Defensive
**Interceptor Spin**
*"I stuck a finger in there once. Still haven't found it."*
	 Blakk throws the Crash Spanner ahead of them and uses curvature manipulation to spin it rapidly in the air, blocking oncoming projectiles. Sturdier attacks can interrupt the spin, and thus it is not effective against them.

### Forged Armament
**(N/A)**
*"In time."*

## T2 - Curvature Manipulation
### Point Attraction/Repulsion
**Calculated Assembly**
*"80% of the screws make it into the finished product. A passing grade by all metrics. I pride myself on doing more with less."*
	If Blakk has the component parts, and is aware of the internal workings of an object, such as through a blueprint, they can use their powers of attraction and repulsion to spontaneously assemble it. 

**Calculated Disassembly**
*"I think we should just outlaw glue actually. I think people who use glue should be forced to drown in the violet."*
	If Blakk knows the internal workings of an object, such as through a blueprint. They can use their powers of attraction and repulsion to spontaneously disassemble it.

**Rapid Disassembly**
*"The road to engineering that lasts is paved with the bodies of apprentices that didn't."*
	Blakk is able to use a rough assumption of the innerworkings of something to spontaneously disassemble it in the space of a finger snap. This can result in damage to the workings of the target, however.

### Selective Action
**Bangle Box**
*"The Daughter's courts enforced a real nuisance of a dress code. I had to wear jewelry. I've never been a fan of it; it's small, fiddly, jams up stuff, and I kept losing it. But this helped."*
	Blakk's Selective Action allows her to filter metal from non-metal, using the divine calculus of the Amaranth Sultan. Metals are attracted to her, and non-metal pushed away.

### Paired Points
**(N/A)**

## T3 - Draws From The Void
### Gifts and Possessions of the Void
**Cache of Contraptions**
*"A visiting Daughter once asked the one I served, 'What kind of people survive in the Dark?'. The question was posed to me instead. What I said then is what I'll say now; the punchers, the runners, the Void has them plenty, both on the fields and under them. But the thinkers? The thinkers last. I have chosen to be a thinker."*
	Lurking just under the local Horizon is Blakk's Cache of Contraptions, their personal toolbelt of answers to every question. By carving a rift and reaching into the depths, they can retrieve a contraption and deploy in battle as they see fit. With their Formshift, they can manipulate the nature of each contraption to ensure they are always ready for whatever the Switchboard brings.

**Contraption #1 - Strafe Boosters**
*"By eliminating the need to walk, we raised workshop efficiency by 35%. The number of workshop incidents increased as well during this period, but I am certain it is unrelated."*
	Retrofitted Fel-Arcad competitive rocketskates expand upwards to the waist with layered armored plate, spring-reliant shock absorbers, redundant gyro sensors and accelerometers, and high-throughput exhaust vents. With them, Blakk gains considerable mobility.
 - Utility
**Cruise Control**
*"nnnnnnneeeeaaaAAAARRRROOWWW"*
	Blakk gains the ability to hover above the ground as well as a considerable boost to speed, allowing them to skate rapidly across the battlefield, repositioning to dodge attacks or launch them.
 - Offensive - Skew
**Blast Hack**
*"Whiplash builds character."*
	Additional boosters are fitted to the back of the Strafe Booster assembly, and the internal enginery is replaced with a high-capacity battery. Blakk's hovering and passive mobility are disabled, in favor of bursts of high speed and maneuverability after the battery is charged. For brief moments, Blakk can move at speeds close to that of sound, but they are balanced by downtimes of needing to recharge.
 - Utility - Skew
**Featherlight Hack**
*"Its both more and less fun than you'd think."*
	Curvature-inducing retrofits are built into the booster assembly, allowing Blakk to use them to fly. While vertical movement is fairly swift, horizontal movement is mildly curtailed. 

**Contraption #2 - Repulsor Plate**
*"Its a little heavy on the upper-body, and it certainly isn't the best thing in my wardrobe, but I'd be dead and gone without it."*
	Depthstone-impregnated particle suspension chambers controlled by proximity sensor lattices, interlaced with chainmail, solid plate and featherlight padding creates a void-attuned breastplate capable of defeating all manners of threats.
- Defensive
**Gossamer Barricade**
*"I can tune it to even repel air."*
	The Repulsor Plate uses user-tunable threat detection algorithms to induce repulsive pockets of force to repel incoming threats. It boasts considerable utility against projectiles, and even attacking personnel can be kept well beyond arm's length.
- Offensive - Skew
**Slam Hack**
*"It genuinely never stops being funny."*
	The Repulsor Plate is refitted with a battery. When charged, it analyzes all targets in local space and selects according to parameters most likely to be met by a human target. It then induces a considerable repulsive force right under them, launching them into the air, followed by an even more intense attractive force that pulls them back down, slamming them into the ground. This attack has an internal cooldown dictated by the Repulsor Plate's battery.
- Utility - Skew
**Cloak Hack**
*"There are times I've used it while sitting at my desk, and watched as people stumble around my office, files in hand, wondering if they should drop them or go look for me. But I usually get caught, often from laughing too hard."*
	Local manipulation of air allows for distorting the form, interfering with observation mechanisms ranging from mundane visuals to Chalkweaver Weavesight.

**Contraption #3 - Assault Gauntlets**
*"It's very straightforward."*
	From the shoulders to the fingertips are reticulated metal plates fastened and layered, servos constraining the imperfect twitches of the arm. Force-multiplying motors grant strength to every movement, and lashed to the forearms are twin-barrel machine guns; the answer to many a stupid question.
- Offensive
**Barrage** - Cado, Siph
*"Very, very straightforward."*
	Blakk takes aim and fires a barrage of pale amara projectiles. They pierce and siphon chalk from the targets they strike, empowering Blakk as a denizen of the depths.
  - Offensive - Skew
**Napalm Hack** - Induc, Siph
*"Let 'em stew.'"*
	The twin machinegun barrels are cycled out in favor of a nozzle, and a canister is fitted to the back. Blakk can blast dense swathes of incredibly hot flames at close targets, incinerating them and inflicting heavy inductive burn, as well as siphoning their calcic reserves.
 - Offensives - Skew
**Boost Bludgeoner Hack** - Brch
*"I am under oath to not share the formula for the rocket boosters. That being said, I take my coffee with milk, two sugars, a measure of stardrip, tritanium powder, supercooled-gallium, yellow dye #5, sawdust and burnt kacherock."*
	Blakk's gauntlets are refitted with spiked alloy shielding on the fingers and various housings and nozzles on the wrist and elbow. These housings store void-renewed rocket enginery, which fire out through the nozzles and produce considerable thrust. These rockets are triggered by Blakk's movement, firing when they detect an action interpretable as a thrown punch. Each punch of Blakk's is thus accelerated by rocket propulsion, and the Boost Bludgeoners are capable of punching through solid metal.
 - Offensive - Skew
**Hook-shot Hack** - Induc
*"If I really focus, I can pluck a hair off a beard. Usually I just break a nose."*
	The gauntlets are refitted with repulsion-capable apparatus and high-strength chain, allowing for launching the arms and retracting them. Should they strike a target, Blakk can reel them in while they are unable to resist due to a heavy inductive stun. If they fire at an object, they can reel it towards them, or reel themselves towards it.
- Offensive - Skew
**Railgun Hack** - Brch, Cado, Unrav, Prax
Axle: Formshift | Re-Innovate
*"Tuned. Over-tuned possibly. Maybe more than possibly. Almost certainly. I might have been asked to stop using it."*
	Blakk holds both arms parallel and aims at a target, while the thermal capacitors in the gauntlets begin to charge. At full capacity, they fire a depthstone projectile with ludicrous velocity, piercing and breaching armor and inflicting heavy unravelling on targets hit by it.
	Additionally, the damage done by the railgun scales with the **hack counter**; the number of active hacks on currently active contraptions. At **five stacks**, the railgun gains a praxis component to its damage, and deals additional damage against **those who hold ill sentiment towards the things of the Void**.

**Contraption #4 - Breach Visors**
*"Helps me keep track of loose screws."*
	Cross-spectra sensorial apparatus mounted to the windows of the spirit grants the wearer optical prowess. The language spoken by all things, the evangelism inherent to things that exist, becomes the domain of the one gifted sight.
	- Blakk's Breach Visors cannot be given hacks. Instead, as they are innovated upon, they add to an internal, separate hack counter of how many times they have been innovated, which scales the effectiveness of the Breach Visors. It still, however, contributes **one point** to the **hack counter**.
	- Blakk's Breach Visors additionally take **two** Innovation Charges to summon.
- Utility
**Artificer Vision**
*"Follow the data. Find the answer."*
	The Breach Visors enhance other components of Blakk's loadout;
	- **Strafe Boosters: Blast Hack** can be chain-triggered into itself five times, granting Blakk the ability to perform five bursts of immense velocity that decays with time, allowing instantaneously changing direction.
	- **Assault Gauntlets: Barrage** and **Railgun Hack** have greatly increased accuracy. Additionally, the scaling damage from stacking the **hack counter** on the Railgun Hack is **uncapped.**
	- **Assault Gauntlets: Hook-shot Hack** can now send hyperweave careening down its length, dealing devastating damage to any at the end of the hook.
	- **Repulsor Plate: Slam Hack** can now discriminate between targets at Blakk's discretion.
	- Blakk's **Draw Strike: Hazard Drawer** sees additional modifications;
		- Twice as many missiles are spawned, and they home more aggressively on targets.
		- The blinding flash and stunning sonic follow-up is additionally accompanied by a wave of curvature distortion, flinging all targets backwards a considerable distance.
		- The shower of oil is mixed with additional compounds, producing a larger explosion.
	- Blakk's **Innovation Charge** gain from using her Formshift is **tripled**.
  
- **Contraption #5 - The Black Ice Shield**
*"By all metrics, my finest work."*
Otherwise dull metals are melted and fused to form pristine alloy, and the incants of the dwellers in the Dark, the riftlock arbiters of the Deep, and the daughter-born scorn-bearers of the Sky are stamped into its make. Around its edges are a lip of violet amara, rime and ash gathering on its vertices, effused from the underwhere. Gripped with the conviction implicit to its making, blackened frost springs forth, granting shape to the buckler. Its lattice quakes at the ever-present possibility of its own unmaking.
	Tooled and shaped in the deepest dark of the Void, Blakk's **Black Ice Shield** has attained void-hallowed status, becoming a weapon that evangelizes the word of the Amaranth Daughters. In its usage, it spawns Blakk's signature **black ice**, a crystalline hybrid complex of amaranthite and packed water-ice. **When struck**, it **assimilates the momentum of the strike**, and dissipates it within its crystal structure, **shattering explosively with proportional force**.
	- Rather than being Re-Innovated under Blakk's **Formshift: Innovation Routine**, the Black Ice Shield can only be summoned **after all four others of Blakk's Contraptions are active**, requires **having more than 20 innovation charges**, and is always in **hacked** state, adding one point to the hack counter. Using the powers provided by the Black Ice Shield adds **virtual charge** to the hack counter, building it beyond cap. 
	- The Black Ice Shield, however, consumes a number of **innovation charges** to perform its abilities, and is returned to the Void when the innovation charge counter is depleted to **twenty charges**.
- Offensive
**Winter's Throw** - Brch
*"Catch."*
	Blakk throws the Black Ice Shield. Targets struck with it are encased in black ice, and the shield rebounds between targets, seeking out the strongest - calcically-determined - and working down from there, rebounding between a maximum of three targets. The shield can be recalled back to Blakk at will.
	- This ability consumes **4 Innovation Charges**.
- Offensive
**Glacial Quake** - Cado, Brch
*"Watch out for falling rocks."*
	Blakk slams the edge of the shield in the ground, causing a cascading wave of jagged black ice to emanate in a cone before her, ripping through and freezing any targets caught in its effective radius.
	- This ability consumes **6 Innovation Charges**.
- Offensive
**Cold Shoulder**
*"Please remember that teeth are small objects and are expectedly a choking hazard."*
	Blakk charges and then rams a target frontally with the full brunt of the shield. Struck targets are encased in black ice, targets that are already encased in black ice are shattered, causing it to explode.
	- This ability consumes **3 Innovation Charges**.
- Defensive
**Artificer's Parry**
*"Nothing quite like seeing gears mesh so nicely together."*
	Blakk performs a swipe with the shield, with the aim of wholly nullifying an attack. Performed perfectly, the attack is nullified, the attacker or striking projectile is encased in black ice, and Blakk reaps **an amount of innovation points proportional to the severity of the attack.**
	- This ability consumes **10 Innovation Charges**.
- Utility
**Shattering Bulwark**
*"A failsafe is an essential."*
	If the Black Ice Shield is struck with an attack strong enough to utterly destroy it, or after taking enough damage it, it explodes violently into a massive glacier of black ice. 

### Draw Strike
**Hazard Drawer** - Cado, Brch, Induc, Unrav
*"The mark of a good engineer is organization. The mark of a better engineer is not needing it."*
	When Blakk executes her **Innovation Routine** formshift, one of six phenomena occur, randomly chosen;
	- Three to five weave-seeking missiles emerge from the rift and hunt down the strongest discernable targets in the vicinity, exploding once sufficiently close-by. 
	- The vicinity is suffused with glass-based gas, doing damage exclusively to those bearing the Strider Protocol.
	- A blinding flash and a disorienting sonic follow-up surge from the rift, stunning all targets.
	- An explosion of lacerating depthstone shrapnel that rips through friend and foe alike, defeating defenses and armor.
	- A shower of oil that suffuses the air and slicks the ground beneath, before violently igniting.
	- A burst of immensely powerful hyperweave that crackles indiscriminately through the air, sundering chalk and weave with destabilizing wrath.

### Formshift
**Innovation Routine**
*"I was never the best acolyte, but I did what I had to. It's paid off."*
  
Blakk's Formshift allows them to return contraptions in the Cache of the Contraptions after summoning them. When Blakk summons a contraption from their cache, they expend one 'charge' of '**Innovation**'. Blakk is able to summon the first contraption - that is, no other contraptions are active - for free. All of Blakk's contraptions are summoned as **possessions** by default. 

However, when Blakk formshifts a contraption in **possession state**, it expends an innovation charge and returns as a **gift from the void**, with a skew known as a **hack**. These hacks alter the **functionality of contraptions** in Blakk's active arsenal, and adds a charge to Blakk's **hack counter**. Additionally, triggering re-**Innovate** on a **hacked** contraption - that is innovating/formshifting a contraption **with an active hack/skew** - **refunds two Innovation charges**, which allows Blakk to summon more contraptions.

Thus, Blakk has three actions they can perform; **formshift/innovate**, **formshift/*re*-innovate**, and **summoning** - leading to the following rotation;
- Blakk begins with zero Innovation Charges (ICs), zero points on the Hack Counter (HC), zero possession/taken-state contraptions (PSCs) and zero hacked/gift-state contraptions (HSCs).
- Blakk **summons** their first PSC for free, the Strafe Boosters.
- Blakk then **innovates** the Strafe Boosters into their Blast **Hack** form, adding one point to the **hack counter** and granting one contraption in hacked state, and reducing their taken state contraption number to zero.
- Blakk then **re-innovates** the Blast Hack on the Strafe Boosters into the Featherlight Hack. This yields **two Innovation Charges**, while the HC and the HSC counts remain at one.
> This is due to the fact the Hack Counter merely counts the number of summoned contraptions that *currently have* **active hacks**, and isn't a stacking counter of *how many hacks Blakk has shifted and cycled through*.
- Blakk **summons** two more contraptions - the Assault Gauntlets and Repulsor Plate, **expending** her two ICs, gaining two PSCs and the HC and HSC counters remain at zero.
- Blakk then **innovates** all PSCs and **re-innovates** all HSCs. This yields **three** HSCs, raises the HC to **three points**, yields **two ICs** (from re-innovating the HSC) and reduces the number of PSCs to zero.
- Blakk **summons** their final contraption - the Breach Visor - depleting **two ICs**, raising the PSC count to **one**, and the HC and HSC count remain the same.
- Blakk **innovates** the one PSC and **re-innovates** all three HSCs. This reduces the number of PSCs to zero, and the number of HSCs to four. It additionally raises the HC to four. However, the Breach Visors have a unique effect when active, that **triples** all IC gain from using the Formshift. As such, **re-innovating** all three HSCs yields **six ICs** per HSC, resulting in **18 ICs** gained.
- **Re-innovating** all HSCs with the Breach Visor modifier active yields **24 ICs**, which added to the original 18 becomes **44 ICs**.

Blakk can also **expend two innovation charges** to formshift a contraption with a hack (a void gift) and return it to the Void, to then re-Take it as a contraption in base form with no hacks (a void possession). This depletes the count on the hack counter, expectedly.

>Additionally,
>- With upwards of **20 ICs** available, Blakk can summon the final contraption, the **Black Ice Shield**. This raises the HC to 5.
>- Attacks with the Black Ice Shield consume ICs but generate **virtual points** for the Hack Counter, allowing it to exceed the cap.
>- Virtual points added to the Hack Counter allows for further empowering the **Assault Gauntlets: Railgun Hack** and the **Rift Vibrokhopesh**'s **Utility: Momentum Conduit**. When expended on either attack, all virtual points are lost.
>- The Blakk Ice Shield dissipating once reaching **20 ICs** allows for Blakk to perform her de-facto finisher; the **Rift Vibrokhopesh**'s **Offensive: Blakkstrikes**. With 20 ICs remaining, Blakk's Blakkstrikes will hit at maximum power. With the virtual hack counter charge instead, Blakk can strike black ice created by the Black Ice Shield before dissipating, imparting its momentum and causing catastrophically damaging explosions.

## T4 - The Deep Hollow
### Hollow Basilica
**Ill-Fitted Workshop** - Induc, Comp, Unrav, Prax 
*"We can all learn a thing or two from each other. Like workplace safety. But not from me."*

Blakk takes hold of local space and plunges it into the depths, expanding a consecrated space encircled by an impassable boundary of prohibitive curvature; the Deep Hollow. Performed with a spread-palmed slap on the ground, all caught in its rapidly expanding range are transported into the excavated hollow, and compelled to engage by the rules of Blakk's Basilica.

Blakk's Basilica takes the shape of a metalworking workshop, a spherical space built of dull riveted alloy and piercingly bright lights. Machines of all disciplines - lathes, mills, presses and grinders - take hallowed positions on the cramped floorspace, workbenches littered with files, calipers and blowtorches. Lined against one wall are canisters of all manners of gases, valves at their necks and pipes disappearing into corners and crevices. Cabinets line the wall filled with aged metalwork. An oil slick mocks the mop propped next to it, a shrine to the evils of procrastination. Levers sprout from a central junction box, labeled worryingly with various descriptions of grievous bodily harm. At its center, a vaulted chair, cushioned, regally placed, mechanical arms snapping from its backrest, glowing wires spiraling out from its beneath, blinking monitors bathing it in blue halogen. It watches over the entire workshop, and the steel-bronze scrap-work sculpture of a Daughter leans over it, veil drooping as a willow, watches over the mechanic at its center.

Being a Basilica, both the Forbid and the Binding are active. Blakk's Binding is fairly simple; all within the Basilica space are compelled to assemble a metal box by cutting, folding and welding sheet metal. Should the box be assembled by all parties successfully, the Hollow resolves and dissipates.

The win state for Blakk within her Hollow is for the other parties in it with her to not notice that the lever controlling the ventilation systems is flung down, thus disabling the exhaust fans and rendering her workshop unsafe to work within. Should parties in the workshop perform any welding while the ventilation system remains off, they are immediately struck by the massively toxic fumes from vaporizing flux, causing them to sustain a **heavy inductive poison** that tears through their lattice, as well as **computational damage that inhibits their performance of chalkweaving and other abilities**, heavy **unravelling that further restricts any calcic casting**, and finally a heavy dose of **praxis sundering that weakens them, their allies, and connected parties** even further. At this point, Blakk may complete her own assembly of the metal box - with a gas mask equipped - and thus fulfill the Binding of her Basilica, causing it to resolve and collapse.

The intricacies of Blakk's Basilica Binding is that a single box must be assembled before the Hollow can resolve, and thus Blakk is incentivized by the logic of her Hollow and derivative battle strategy to never weld first. If she does, and doesn't weld with either a gas mask on or after turning on the ventilation, she will be struck by her own poisonous flux vapors, and indicate to those within the Hollow that something must be done to nullify the danger posed by gas in an enclosed space.

Should the other parties discover that the workshop is poorly ventilated, resolve the problem and complete their assembly of the metal box, the Hollow resolves, leaving them unmolested and Blakk with no advantage gained, and a considerable one lost as Blakk's Hollow has little effect on those who've defeated it once before.
