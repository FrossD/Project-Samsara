[Legal system - The World Factbook (cia.gov)](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/legal-system/)

**Top-Level Differentiation**
- **Civil Law** - The most widespread type of legal system in the world, applied in various forms in approximately 150 countries. Also referred to as European continental law, the civil law system is derived mainly from the Roman _Corpus Juris Civilus_, (Body of Civil Law), a collection of laws and legal interpretations compiled under the East Roman (Byzantine) Emperor Justinian I between A.D. 528 and 565. The major feature of civil law systems is that the laws are organized into systematic written codes. In civil law the sources recognized as authoritative are principally legislation - especially codifications in constitutions or statutes enacted by governments - and secondarily, custom. The civil law systems in some countries are based on more than one code.
- **Common Law** - A type of legal system, often synonymous with "English common law," which is the system of England and Wales in the UK, and is also in force in approximately 80 countries formerly part of or influenced by the former British Empire. English common law reflects Biblical influences as well as remnants of law systems imposed by early conquerors including the Romans, Anglo-Saxons, and Normans. Some legal scholars attribute the formation of the English common law system to King Henry II (r.1154-1189). Until the time of his reign, laws customary among England's various manorial and ecclesiastical (church) jurisdictions were administered locally. Henry II established the king's court and designated that laws were "common" to the entire English realm. The foundation of English common law is "legal precedent" - referred to as _stare decisis_, meaning "to stand by things decided." In the English common law system, court judges are bound in their decisions in large part by the rules and other doctrines developed - and supplemented over time - by the judges of earlier English courts.
- **Customary Law** - A type of legal system that serves as the basis of, or has influenced, the present-day laws in approximately 40 countries - mostly in Africa, but some in the Pacific islands, Europe, and the Near East. Customary law is also referred to as "primitive law," "unwritten law," "indigenous law," and "folk law." There is no single history of customary law such as that found in Roman civil law, English common law, Islamic law, or the Napoleonic Civil Code. The earliest systems of law in human society were customary, and usually developed in small agrarian and hunter-gatherer communities. As the term implies, customary law is based upon the customs of a community. Common attributes of customary legal systems are that they are seldom written down, they embody an organized set of rules regulating social relations, and they are agreed upon by members of the community. Although such law systems include sanctions for law infractions, resolution tends to be reconciliatory rather than punitive. A number of African states practiced customary law many centuries prior to colonial influences. Following colonization, such laws were written down and incorporated to varying extents into the legal systems imposed by their colonial powers.



**Civil Law Versus Common Law**
Civil law and common law are two different legal systems used in various countries around the world. They have distinct origins, principles, and approaches to resolving legal disputes. Here are the key differences between civil law and common law systems:

1. Historical Development:
   - Common Law: Common law systems originated in England and are characterized by a body of judicial decisions, or case law, that serves as precedent for future cases. Judges in common law systems interpret and apply existing laws, statutes, and prior court decisions to decide cases. The doctrine of stare decisis (precedent) is a fundamental principle.
   - Civil Law: Civil law systems, on the other hand, have their roots in Roman law and the Napoleonic Code. These systems rely more on written codes and statutes as the primary source of law, with less emphasis on case law or precedent. Judges in civil law systems have a more limited role in shaping the law; their primary task is to apply the law to the facts of the case.

2. Role of Precedent:
   - Common Law: Precedent is a crucial element of the common law system. Judges are bound by decisions made in higher courts and often consider prior cases when making judgments. The principle of stare decisis means that decisions made in previous cases set legal standards for similar future cases.
   - Civil Law: In civil law systems, prior court decisions are not binding on judges in the same way as in common law systems. While they may be considered for guidance, they do not carry the same weight as precedents in common law.

3. Legal Codes:
   - Common Law: Common law systems typically have comprehensive legal codes that codify various areas of law, such as criminal law, contract law, and property law. These codes are supplemented by case law.
   - Civil Law: Civil law systems rely heavily on comprehensive legal codes that encompass various aspects of law. These codes are the primary source of law, and judges interpret and apply them to resolve cases.

4. Inquisitorial vs. Adversarial System:
   - Common Law: Common law systems follow an adversarial approach, where opposing parties in a case present their arguments, and judges serve as impartial referees who weigh the evidence and arguments to reach a decision.
   - Civil Law: Civil law systems often use an inquisitorial approach, where judges play a more active role in investigating cases, gathering evidence, and questioning witnesses. The emphasis is on the judge's active pursuit of the truth.

5. Legal Education:
   - Common Law: Legal education in common law countries typically focuses on case analysis, legal reasoning, and the study of precedent. Law students often participate in moot court exercises and analyze case law extensively.
   - Civil Law: Legal education in civil law countries places greater emphasis on the study of legal codes and statutes. Students may have less exposure to case law analysis.

It's important to note that many legal systems around the world are not purely civil law or common law but may incorporate elements of both. Additionally, legal systems can evolve and adapt over time, leading to variations within each system.

**Origin of the Jury System**
The jury system has ancient origins and has evolved over time. Its development can be traced back to various historical civilizations and legal traditions. Here are some key points about the origin of the jury system:

1. Ancient Greece: The concept of a jury system can be traced back to ancient Greece, particularly in Athens, around the 5th century BCE. In Athens, a system of citizen juries was used to decide various legal and political matters, including criminal trials. These juries were composed of a randomly selected group of citizens who would hear evidence and arguments and then render a verdict.

2. Ancient Rome: The Roman Republic also had a form of jury system, known as the "judex" system. In this system, a panel of citizens would be selected to serve as judges in civil and criminal cases. Roman law and legal procedures had a significant influence on the development of legal systems in Europe, including the jury system.

3. Medieval England: The modern jury system, as it is known today, has strong roots in medieval England. In the 12th century, under the reign of King Henry II, the jury system began to take shape. The "jury of presentment" was introduced, where local residents would make accusations against individuals they believed had committed crimes. This evolved into the trial jury, where a group of citizens would hear evidence and render a verdict in criminal cases.

4. Magna Carta: The Magna Carta, signed in 1215, played a significant role in establishing the jury system as a fundamental right. It included provisions that ensured that freemen would not be deprived of life, liberty, or property except through the law of the land and by the judgment of their peers.

5. Evolution and Spread: The jury system continued to evolve in England and was gradually exported to other parts of the world through colonialism and the British Empire. Different jurisdictions adapted the system to their own legal traditions and needs, leading to variations in how juries are used and selected.

6. Influence on Modern Legal Systems: Today, the jury system is a fundamental element of many legal systems, particularly in common law countries like the United States and the United Kingdom. It is used in both civil and criminal trials to ensure that a panel of ordinary citizens plays a role in determining guilt or innocence and in civil cases, assessing damages.

While the jury system has ancient origins, its principles and practices have evolved significantly over time. Modern jury systems aim to provide a fair and impartial process for resolving legal disputes and determining the guilt or innocence of individuals accused of crimes.

**Alternatives to Juries**
Nations and legal systems that do not use the jury system typically rely on different methods for adjudicating legal disputes and determining the guilt or innocence of individuals accused of crimes. The specific procedures and mechanisms can vary widely from one country or legal tradition to another. Here are some alternatives to the jury system:

1. **Judge-Only Trials:** In some legal systems, particularly civil law systems, judges play a more prominent role in determining the outcome of trials. Judges alone hear evidence, assess the law, and render verdicts. This approach is known as an inquisitorial system, where judges are responsible for both investigating the case and deciding the verdict.

2. **Mixed Tribunals:** Some countries and legal systems use a combination of judges and lay assessors or experts to decide cases. While judges provide legal expertise and guidance, lay assessors or experts may offer input on technical or specialized matters. This approach is common in some European countries.

3. **Magistrates or Justices of the Peace:** In certain legal systems, especially for minor offenses, magistrates or justices of the peace may preside over cases without juries. They have the authority to make decisions on guilt or innocence and may impose sentences within certain limits.

4. **Administrative Tribunals:** For certain types of cases, such as immigration, social security, or employment disputes, administrative tribunals or boards may be used instead of traditional courts. These bodies typically consist of experts in the relevant field who make determinations based on specific regulations and laws.

5. **Professional Judges:** Some countries, particularly in civil law systems, rely on professional judges who have specialized training and expertise in the law. These judges may sit alone or in panels to decide cases.

6. **Arbitration and Mediation:** Alternative dispute resolution methods, such as arbitration and mediation, are used in many legal systems to resolve civil disputes without going to court. In these processes, neutral third parties help parties reach a mutually agreeable resolution.

7. **Panel of Judges:** In some countries, especially in appellate courts, cases are heard by a panel of judges rather than a single judge. These panels collectively decide the outcome of cases.

8. **Trial by Ordeal or Oath:** Historically, some societies used trial by ordeal or trial by oath as methods of determining guilt or innocence. These methods involved superstitious or religious rituals and were not based on rational legal principles. They are no longer in use in modern legal systems.

> Trial by oath is a nifty idea for the Sil'khan and maybe Vahnkin.

It's important to note that the legal procedures and systems can vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another, and many legal systems incorporate elements of both adversarial and inquisitorial approaches. The choice of which system to use depends on legal traditions, cultural factors, and the specific needs and priorities of each country's legal system.

**When are Juries used?**
Juries are typically used in judicial proceedings, particularly in common law systems, to determine the facts of a case and render a verdict. Here are some common situations in which juries are used:

1. **Criminal Trials:** Juries are often used in criminal trials to determine whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of the charges brought against them. The prosecution presents evidence and witnesses to prove the defendant's guilt, while the defense presents its case. The jury listens to the evidence, deliberates, and then renders a verdict. If the defendant is found guilty, the jury may also be involved in sentencing in some jurisdictions.

2. **Civil Trials:** In civil trials, where one party is suing another for damages, compensation, or other remedies, juries may be used to determine liability and assess damages. The jury listens to the evidence and arguments presented by both sides and makes a determination based on the preponderance of evidence.

3. **Grand Juries:** Grand juries are used in some jurisdictions to decide whether there is enough evidence to bring formal charges in a criminal case. Unlike trial juries, grand juries do not determine guilt or innocence. Instead, they determine whether there is probable cause to proceed with a trial.

4. **Tribunals and Inquests:** Juries can also be used in special tribunals or inquests to investigate specific incidents or issues. For example, coroner's inquests in some countries may involve juries to determine the cause and circumstances of a person's death.

5. **Bench Trials:** In some cases, parties to a legal dispute may opt for a bench trial, where a judge alone decides the case without a jury. This is often done when both parties agree to waive their right to a jury trial or when the case involves complex legal issues.

6. **Advisory Juries:** In certain situations, judges may use advisory juries to obtain input from a jury on specific legal or factual issues. The judge is not bound by the advisory jury's recommendations but may consider them when making a final decision.

7. **Specialized Juries:** In some jurisdictions, specialized juries, such as a medical malpractice panel or a patent jury, may be used for cases that require specific expertise.

It's important to note that the use of juries can vary from one jurisdiction to another and may depend on the type of case, the legal traditions of the country, and the preferences of the parties involved. Some countries and legal systems rely less on juries and more on professional judges or other methods of dispute resolution.

Creating a fictional judicial and legal system for a story or world-building exercise can be a fascinating and creative endeavor. To build a compelling and internally consistent legal system, here are some key considerations:

1. **System Type:** Decide on the type of legal system your fictional world will have. Will it be based on common law, civil law, or something entirely unique? Consider the historical, cultural, and societal factors that might influence the system.

2. **Legal Structure:** Determine the structure of your legal system. Will it have different levels of courts, such as trial courts, appellate courts, and a supreme court? How are judges or magistrates appointed or elected?

3. **Role of Judges:** Define the role and powers of judges or magistrates. Are they responsible for interpreting and applying the law, or do they also investigate cases like an inquisitorial system? Are they elected, appointed, or chosen through a different process?

4. **Role of Juries:** Decide whether your legal system will use juries and in what types of cases. Consider how jurors are selected, their qualifications, and their responsibilities. Determine whether verdicts must be unanimous or majority-based.

5. **Legal Codes and Statutes:** Create a legal code or set of statutes that form the basis of your legal system. Outline the laws and regulations governing various aspects of society, including criminal, civil, and administrative matters.

6. **Legal Education:** Establish a system for legal education and training. Define how lawyers and judges receive their legal education, including the duration and curriculum of law schools or training programs.

7. **Legal Profession:** Determine the role of legal professionals in your world. This includes lawyers, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and legal scholars. Consider whether there are specialized legal roles or guilds.

8. **Legal Procedures:** Develop courtroom procedures, rules of evidence, and trial processes. Specify how cases are initiated, how evidence is presented, and how trials are conducted. Consider whether there are alternative dispute resolution methods in your world.

9. **Rights and Liberties:** Define the legal rights and liberties enjoyed by individuals in your society. Include concepts such as due process, the right to a fair trial, and protections against self-incrimination.

10. **Punishment and Sentencing:** Determine the types of punishments and sentencing guidelines in your legal system. This may include imprisonment, fines, rehabilitation, or alternative sentencing options.

11. **Legal Institutions:** Create institutions that support the legal system, such as law enforcement agencies, correctional facilities, and legal aid organizations.

12. **Appeals and Review:** Establish mechanisms for appealing decisions and reviewing cases. Decide whether there are specialized appellate courts and under what circumstances cases can be reviewed.

13. **Legal Philosophy:** Consider the underlying legal philosophy or ideologies that influence your legal system. Is it based on principles of justice, order, tradition, or something else?

14. **Cultural and Societal Influences:** Think about how the legal system reflects the culture and values of your fictional society. How does it address issues related to diversity, religion, and social norms?

15. **Conflict and Drama:** Keep in mind that a fictional legal system can be a rich source of conflict and drama in your story. Consider how legal cases and courtroom proceedings can drive the narrative.

16. **Consistency:** Ensure that your legal system is internally consistent and adheres to its established rules and principles throughout your story.

By carefully considering these elements and how they interact within your fictional world, you can create a legal system that adds depth and authenticity to your storytelling or world-building project.


### 18. Politics and Economy
#### Research On Democratic Republics and Social Democracies
**Democratic Republic**
The democratic republic system of government is a form of government that combines elements of democracy and republicanism. In this system, the ultimate authority rests with the people, who exercise their power through elected representatives. It is characterized by the following key features:

1. Representative Democracy: The democratic republic system involves the election of representatives by the citizens to make decisions on their behalf. These representatives serve as a link between the government and the people, representing their interests and concerns.

2. Separation of Powers: The system typically incorporates a separation of powers among different branches of government, such as the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. This division helps to prevent the concentration of power in one entity and promotes a system of checks and balances.

3. Constitutional Framework: Democratic republics often have a written constitution that outlines the fundamental principles, rights, and responsibilities of the government and its citizens. The constitution serves as a legal framework that governs the functioning of the government and protects individual rights.

4. Rule of Law: The rule of law is a fundamental aspect of democratic republics. It implies that all individuals, including government officials, are subject to and must abide by the law. It ensures that decisions and actions are based on legal principles rather than arbitrary power.

5. Protection of Individual Rights: Democratic republics typically emphasize the protection of individual rights and freedoms. These rights may include freedom of speech, assembly, religion, press, and the right to a fair trial. The government's role is to safeguard these rights and provide equal opportunities for all citizens.

6. Free and Fair Elections: Regular elections are a vital component of democratic republics. They allow citizens to choose their representatives and provide a mechanism for peaceful transfer of power. Free and fair elections are crucial to ensuring the legitimacy of the government and promoting political participation.

7. Civic Participation: Democratic republics encourage active civic participation and engagement. Citizens have the right to express their opinions, form political parties or interest groups, and engage in peaceful protests or demonstrations. Public participation is seen as essential for the democratic process.

Examples of democratic republics include the United States, France, Germany, India, and Brazil. However, it is important to note that each country may have variations in their specific governmental structures and processes while adhering to the principles of democratic republicanism.

**Social Democracy**
Social democracy is a political and economic ideology that combines elements of socialism and democracy. It seeks to achieve social and economic justice through a mixed economy that combines market-based capitalism with government intervention and social welfare programs. Here are some key characteristics of social democracy:

1. Welfare State: Social democracies prioritize the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state. This involves providing social safety nets, such as universal healthcare, education, unemployment benefits, and pensions, to ensure a basic standard of living for all citizens.

2. Economic Regulation: Social democrats believe in regulating the economy to mitigate the negative effects of unregulated capitalism. They advocate for measures such as progressive taxation, minimum wage laws, workers' rights protections, and regulations on businesses to promote fair distribution of wealth and reduce inequality.

3. Equality and Social Justice: Social democracy places a strong emphasis on equality and social justice. It seeks to reduce socioeconomic disparities and create a more equitable society by addressing systemic inequalities, promoting social mobility, and combating discrimination based on factors like gender, race, and ethnicity.

4. Mixed Economy: Social democracies typically operate under a mixed economy, combining elements of both private enterprise and government intervention. While private businesses and markets are allowed to operate, the government plays a role in regulating the economy, providing public goods and services, and ensuring fair competition.

5. Democratic Governance: Social democracies uphold democratic principles, including free and fair elections, respect for human rights, and the protection of civil liberties. They aim to combine economic democracy with political democracy, providing citizens with opportunities for political participation and decision-making.

6. Balancing Individual Freedom and Collective Responsibility: Social democrats strive to strike a balance between individual freedom and collective responsibility. While respecting individual rights and freedoms, they recognize the importance of collective action and shared responsibility in addressing social challenges and ensuring the well-being of all citizens.

7. Evolutionary Reform: Social democracy often advocates for gradual, reformist change rather than revolutionary transformation. It seeks to achieve its goals through democratic means, working within existing political systems to introduce progressive policies and reforms.

Notable examples of countries that have embraced social democracy to varying degrees include the Nordic countries (such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland), Germany, and the Netherlands. It is important to note that the specific implementation and policies of social democracy can vary across countries and over time, reflecting different cultural, historical, and political contexts.


### 19. Social Problems
#### Classification of Social Problems
> Provided by ChatGPT

Social problems in a society can be classified in various ways, depending on the specific perspective or framework being used. Here are some common ways to classify social problems:

1. **Structural/Institutional Problems (Struc.)**
	These are social problems rooted in the structure and functioning of societal institutions. Examples include economic inequality, systemic racism, gender discrimination, and unequal access to education, healthcare, or justice.

2. **Economic Problems (Econs.)**
	These problems pertain to issues related to the economy, such as poverty, unemployment, income inequality, inadequate social welfare programs, or economic instability.

3. **Environmental Problems (Envir.)**
	These problems are related to the degradation of the environment and the consequences it has on society. Examples include climate change, pollution, deforestation, depletion of natural resources, and loss of biodiversity.

4. **Health and Well-being Problems (Healt.)**
	These problems focus on issues that affect the physical and mental well-being of individuals and communities. They may include inadequate healthcare, mental health stigma, substance abuse, infectious diseases, or access to clean water and sanitation.

5. **Cultural/Social Norms Problems (Cultr.)**
	These problems arise from harmful or discriminatory cultural or social norms prevalent in a society. Examples include gender-based violence, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or religion, homophobia, transphobia, ageism, or ableism.

6. **Political Problems (Polit.)**
	These problems are related to issues within the political system, including corruption, lack of transparency, abuse of power, voter suppression, human rights violations, lack of democratic processes, or political polarization.

7. **Technological Problems (Techn.)**
	These problems arise due to the impact of technology on society, such as privacy concerns, digital divide, cyberbullying, fake news, misinformation, or ethical dilemmas surrounding artificial intelligence and automation.

8. **Demographic Problems (Demog.)**
	These problems focus on issues associated with population characteristics, such as aging population, youth unemployment, migration, urbanization, or disparities based on ethnicity, religion, or immigration status.

It's important to note that these classifications are not mutually exclusive, and many social problems intersect with each other. Moreover, the perception and categorization of social problems may vary depending on cultural, regional, and historical contexts.
