## On Birthing and Being
Twin sections that talk on two major topics related to the Passing; one on being born in the Switchboard, and the other being a bit of - primarily Fel-Arcad but not exclusively so - philosophy regarding the nature of lattices, particularly bodies.

## On Descendance
> Section.

### The Ritual of Conjugation
Chalk has had a tangible effect on the means of descendance in the Switchboard, particularly as regarding methods. Two methods exist for Striders to produce descendants; the regular method of intercourse and chalk-derivative method known as the '**Ritual of Conjugation**'.

The regular method works as one would expect, obeying the mechanics we've come to know surrounding conception, gestation and eventual birth. These mechanics are somewhat altered however, as they operate now under the calcic universe and thus the principles of **information tangibility**. This is elaborated upon later.

The **Ritual of Conjugation** - perhaps the crux of this document - is a little different. It functions by a subject winding a bit of chalk from all of their Five Straits, containing a fairly random measure of the entirety of their lattice's information, having another subject do similar, and both using these 'cuttings' of chalk weave from each other as components in the eponymous ritual of conjugation. The resultant of this ritual is a **conjugate**, an intermediary between chalk and a fully formed person that rapidly grows through feeding on and accumulation of chalk. 

It is a decidedly more clinical method of doing things, but not without its 'benefits' as it might be put. Chief amongst them is how the calcic allows for the bypass of conventional biology. Predominantly, these are the requirements of two opposing sexes, and the constraint of only two contributing parties. With the ritual of conjugation, theoretically any permutation of sexes as well as number of parties may contribute to the formation of a conjugate and eventual descendant, with the intricacies of calcic mechanics and plain mathematical randomness handling the decisions that would result in the final nature of the progeny that emerges.

The chalk conjugate formed requires no conscious sustenance other than a sufficient supply of chalk in the vicinity. As it grows, its appetite for chalk will do similar, and latent chalk may not be enough, and supplementary chalk may need to be provided. Just as chalk is needed to form the actual straits and lattice of the progeny, it is also employed in shaping their nature.

### Calcic Mechanics
Both progeny undergoing familiar gestation and progeny forming via conjugate are subject to information tangibility and its ramifications. One such ramification is in the shaping of the nature of the conjugate.

Under conventional genetics, the physical and mental qualities and quirks of a descendant are solely dependent - primarily and ideally - on their ancestors. The same holds true in the Switchboard under the ritual of conjugation; the contributed weave from each ancestor is placed in a pool of sorts, and pure randomness - in ideal cases - sees qualities selected from any one parent or mixes or averages of them. The physical qualities obtained from the parents this way form a baseline physical appearance for their progeny. It can be subject to further skews however.

The building of the progeny's Five Straits is a bit more consistent and straightforward. Not much fundamental difference exists between the Straits of denizens in the Switchboard, with the the major exceptions being the **potential**, **memory** and **computational** straits. The potential strait is what allows for the storage of chalk within the lattice, and parents with 'deeper' potential straits will expectedly have descendants similarly blessed. The memory strait stores patterned chalk, and while a fresh memory strait is woven for a descendant during the process of their gestation, it isn't unheard of or even uncommon for some things known only to the parents to be passed on to their progeny. Often these are small things like the names of the parents or other oft repeated terms, but in some cases they may inherit more than just memories. A chalkweaver's powers, after all, are stored in the memory line.

Where the effects of information tangibility truly show forth is in the fact the growing conjugate draws on the latent chalk of the environment to grow. In addition to this however, it can take in **pattern** as it would take in pure chalk, and this pattern can integrate itself into the resultant lattice of the progeny.

The hungry chalk-devouring pull of the developing conjugate can pull so strongly on its environs that it can unravel the lattices of objects and likewise around them into pattern, imbibing it within itself and thus taking on their **aspects**. The environment within which a conjugate grows is imprinted upon the resultant progeny, and thus they may be born with affinities or aversions to certain things, physical changes to their appearances, mental changes to their Straits, even graduation to being bestowed with calcic powers.

In some cases, imbibing the latent chalk of an environment imprints a sense of 'home' on the resulting descendant's lattice. Many descendants similarly born in this environment may come to call each other a form of brethren, creating a familial identity between, and thus come to be united in that sense. This sense of home serves practical purposes too, giving its bearer a vague navigational sense of direction towards where their home is - like a compass - even when away from it, useful for orienting oneself during travel.

And all offspring conjugate are subject to the final random servings of the Current. Conjugates forming within the Switchboard will almost certainly be bestowed some *thing* from the Current and from all who came before them, furthering the forward progression of the Switchboard. These gifts or even burdens from the Current are the final wildcards bestowed by the Current upon those born in the Switchboard, the ramifications of them being left to be seen.

### Hereditary Protocols
The Strider and Weave Protocols are genetic - or better put - modifications to the Five Straits intrinsic to 'living' beings within the Switchboard. The Strider Protocol being a 'transcendent' of sorts equation baked into the computational strait, and the Weave Protocol being a modification to the computational strait entirely, such that it is considerably different to a computational strait without it, allows for both of these things to be passed down to descendants.

The successful descendance of these protocols in particular is subject to an element of modifiable randomness. The propensity for a descendant to have either protocol is primarily a derivative of whether their parents possess them; ancestors with a protocol tend to produce descendants with them as well. As a secondary factor, the history of protocol possession up the family tree can affect whether a hypothetical descendant has them as well. Just as parents play a part, grandparents do, and a second generation of protocol-lacking parents born to a first generation of protocol-*having* *grand*parents may result in the third generation progeny having a protocol. 

This rule applies both to traditional methods and the ritual of conjugation, though the ritual of conjugation does slightly slant the results towards progeny having one or both protocols. 

> As a note, the Strider Protocol requires having the Weave Protocol, as striding is an ability that operates via folding chalk.

The descendance of the Strider Protocol in particular can be viewed not in terms of dominant or recessive genes, but rather in a sort of 'meter' that must be filled. When the meter is above a certain threshold, the descendant in question will be able to use the Strider Protocol. If this this threshold isn't reached however, the meter may still be filled enough such that the average of a non-Strider and a Strider's meter may produce a Strider. This mechanic is also responsible for the individual differences in stride velocities.

The Weave Protocol works somewhat differently, with the proficiency of a hypothetical progeny at weaving chalk being dependent on the weave-protocol-enabled computational line, and this in turn being a product of the bayesianity of the doctrine held by the contributing ancestors, as upon this is proficiency at wielding chalk partially reliant. In a sense, strength begets strength in the Switchboard. While parents with solid doctrine gives a valuable baseline to build off of, this foundation is decayed or built upon based by the progeny's own formed personal doctrine. 

### Bequeathed Boons
Descendants stand to inherit a fair bit from their ancestors due to the calcic mechanics attached to descendance, particularly progeny born from the ritual of conjugation. One such example of this is observed in some parents passing on powers and skills of theirs - particularly noteworthy; Teks - to their descendants, and in other cases newly-born in the Switchboard serve as an 'outlet' from the Current for pattern that has dwelt within it for a long time.

A good example of the former is in the case of ancestors in the Switchboard who lived lives that required them to cultivate a diverse array of powers and skills, a good example of such persons being star-faring Striders and Operators. It is fairly common for the descendants of active figures in the Switchboard to produce progeny that inherit some of their signature powers and skills, varying from components in their calcic arsenal to even mundane skills like sword fighting or starship piloting. Where this becomes particularly interesting is in the case of Teks.

Teks for whatever reason have a noteworthy propensity to pass from generation to generation, growing slightly different from the parent Tek, but notably stronger as well. As they pass from hand to hand, they seemingly grow and evolve into new forms, bestowing greater power to new wielders and tying family trees together with binds beyond mere descendance. These **ancestral Teks** as they've come to be called, are Teks that were chiseled long ago from the early Switchboard, and allowed to grow and mature, like obsidian blades that only grow sharper the more they are used. They've spread to various hands with time, branching and taking on new forms as Teks are 'mixed' with other Teks and wielded in new ways. The results are Teks associated with certain factions in the Switchboard, and this ancestral power has given them sway, by right of chalk.

As beings are conceived in the Switchboard, their calcic conjugate pulls from the Current, the collective of patterned chalk that has been formed during the lifespans of beings past, now returned to the Switchboard to be distributed to new hands across the stars. What they pull from the Current can be virtually anything, in a result that seems reminiscent of some form of fate, newborn descendants may emerge with ritual schema or Teks or maps to *somethings* implanted in their minds. Information formerly thought lost has been returned this way, and thus it is always a major affair when progeny arises in the Switchboard.
