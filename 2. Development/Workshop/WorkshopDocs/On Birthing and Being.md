# On Birthing and Being
Twin sections that talk on two major topics related to the Passing; one on being born in the Switchboard, and the other being a bit of - primarily Fel-Arcad but not exclusively so - philosophy regarding the nature of lattices, particularly bodies.

## On Descendance
This section discusses the mechanics behind the emergence of living beings in the Switchboard, narrowed down specifically to the Third Kin, or 'humans'.

### The Ritual of Conjugation
Chalk has had a tangible effect on the means of descendance in the Switchboard, particularly as regarding methods. Two methods exist for Striders to produce descendants; the regular method of intercourse and chalk-derivative method known as the '**Ritual of Conjugation**'.

The regular method works as one would expect, obeying the mechanics we've come to know surrounding conception, gestation and eventual birth. These mechanics are somewhat altered however, as they operate now under the calcic universe and thus the principles of **information tangibility**. This is elaborated upon later.

The **Ritual of Conjugation** - perhaps the crux of this document - is a little different. It functions by a subject winding a bit of chalk from all of their Five Straits, containing a fairly random measure of the entirety of their lattice's information, having another subject do similar, and both using these 'cuttings' of chalk weave from each other as components in the eponymous ritual of conjugation. The resultant of this ritual is a **conjugate**, an intermediary between chalk and a fully formed person that rapidly grows through feeding on and accumulation of chalk. 

It is a decidedly more clinical method of doing things, but not without its 'benefits' as it might be put. Chief amongst them is how the calcic allows for the bypass of conventional biology. Predominantly, these are the requirements of two opposing sexes, and the constraint of only two contributing parties. With the ritual of conjugation, theoretically any permutation of sexes as well as number of parties may contribute to the formation of a conjugate and eventual descendant, with the intricacies of calcic mechanics and plain mathematical randomness handling the decisions that would result in the final nature of the progeny that emerges.

The chalk conjugate formed requires no conscious sustenance other than a sufficient supply of chalk in the vicinity. As it grows, its appetite for chalk will do similar, and latent chalk may not be enough, and supplementary chalk may need to be provided. Just as chalk is needed to form the actual straits and lattice of the progeny, it is also employed in shaping their nature.

### Calcic Mechanics
Both progeny undergoing familiar gestation and progeny forming via conjugate are subject to information tangibility and its ramifications. One such ramification is in the shaping of the nature of the conjugate.

Under conventional genetics, the physical and mental qualities and quirks of a descendant are solely dependent - primarily and ideally - on their ancestors. The same holds true in the Switchboard under the ritual of conjugation; the contributed weave from each ancestor is placed in a pool of sorts, and pure randomness - in ideal cases - sees qualities selected from any one parent or mixes or averages of them. The physical qualities obtained from the parents this way form a baseline physical appearance for their progeny. It can be subject to further skews however.

The building of the progeny's Five Straits is a bit more consistent and straightforward. Not much fundamental difference exists between the Straits of denizens in the Switchboard, with the the major exceptions being the **potential**, **memory** and **computational** straits. The potential strait is what allows for the storage of chalk within the lattice, and parents with 'deeper' potential straits will expectedly have descendants similarly blessed. The memory strait stores patterned chalk, and while a fresh memory strait is woven for a descendant during the process of their gestation, it isn't unheard of or even uncommon for some things known only to the parents to be passed on to their progeny. Often these are small things like the names of the parents or other oft repeated terms, but in some cases they may inherit more than just memories. A chalkweaver's powers, after all, are stored in the memory line.

Where the effects of information tangibility truly show forth is in the fact the growing conjugate draws on the latent chalk of the environment to grow. In addition to this however, it can take in **pattern** as it would take in pure chalk, and this pattern can integrate itself into the resultant lattice of the progeny.

The hungry chalk-devouring pull of the developing conjugate can pull so strongly on its environs that it can unravel the lattices of objects and likewise around them into pattern, imbibing it within itself and thus taking on their **aspects**. The environment within which a conjugate grows is imprinted upon the resultant progeny, and thus they may be born with affinities or aversions to certain things, physical changes to their appearances, mental changes to their Straits, even graduation to being bestowed with calcic powers.

In some cases, imbibing the latent chalk of an environment imprints a sense of 'home' on the resulting descendant's lattice. Many descendants similarly born in this environment may come to call each other a form of brethren, creating a familial identity between, and thus come to be united in that sense. This sense of home serves practical purposes too, giving its bearer a vague navigational sense of direction towards where their home is - like a compass - even when away from it, useful for orienting oneself during travel.

And all offspring conjugate are subject to the final random servings of the Current. Conjugates forming within the Switchboard will almost certainly be bestowed some *thing* from the Current and from all who came before them, furthering the forward progression of the Switchboard. These gifts or even burdens from the Current are the final wildcards bestowed by the Current upon those born in the Switchboard, the ramifications of them being left to be seen.

### Hereditary Protocols
The Strider and Weave Protocols are genetic - or better put - modifications to the Five Straits intrinsic to 'living' beings within the Switchboard. The Strider Protocol being a 'transcendent' of sorts equation baked into the computational strait, and the Weave Protocol being a modification to the computational strait entirely, such that it is considerably different to a computational strait without it, allows for both of these things to be passed down to descendants.

The successful descendance of these protocols in particular is subject to an element of modifiable randomness. The propensity for a descendant to have either protocol is primarily a derivative of whether their parents possess them; ancestors with a protocol tend to produce descendants with them as well. As a secondary factor, the history of protocol possession up the family tree can affect whether a hypothetical descendant has them as well. Just as parents play a part, grandparents do, and a second generation of protocol-lacking parents born to a first generation of protocol-*having* *grand*parents may result in the third generation progeny having a protocol. 

This rule applies both to traditional methods and the ritual of conjugation, though the ritual of conjugation does slightly slant the results towards progeny having one or both protocols. 

> As a note, the Strider Protocol requires having the Weave Protocol, as striding is an ability that operates via folding chalk.

The descendance of the Strider Protocol in particular can be viewed not in terms of dominant or recessive genes, but rather in a sort of 'meter' that must be filled. When the meter is above a certain threshold, the descendant in question will be able to use the Strider Protocol. If this this threshold isn't reached however, the meter may still be filled enough such that the average of a non-Strider and a Strider's meter may produce a Strider. This mechanic is also responsible for the individual differences in stride velocities.

The Weave Protocol works somewhat differently, with the proficiency of a hypothetical progeny at weaving chalk being dependent on the weave-protocol-enabled computational line, and this in turn being a product of the bayesianity of the doctrine held by the contributing ancestors, as upon this is proficiency at wielding chalk partially reliant. In a sense, strength begets strength in the Switchboard. While parents with solid doctrine gives a valuable baseline to build off of, this foundation is decayed or built upon based by the progeny's own formed personal doctrine. 

### Bequeathed Boons
Descendants stand to inherit a fair bit from their ancestors due to the calcic mechanics attached to descendance, particularly progeny born from the ritual of conjugation. One such example of this is observed in some parents passing on powers and skills of theirs - particularly noteworthy; Teks - to their descendants, and in other cases newly-born in the Switchboard serve as an 'outlet' from the Current for pattern that has dwelt within it for a long time.

A good example of the former is in the case of ancestors in the Switchboard who lived lives that required them to cultivate a diverse array of powers and skills, a good example of such persons being star-faring Striders and Operators. It is fairly common for the descendants of active figures in the Switchboard to produce progeny that inherit some of their signature powers and skills, varying from components in their calcic arsenal to even mundane skills like sword fighting or starship piloting. Where this becomes particularly interesting is in the case of Teks.

Teks for whatever reason have a noteworthy propensity to pass from generation to generation, growing slightly different from the parent Tek, but notably stronger as well. As they pass from hand to hand, they seemingly grow and evolve into new forms, bestowing greater power to new wielders and tying family trees together with binds beyond mere descendance. These **ancestral Teks** as they've come to be called, are Teks that were chiseled long ago from the early Switchboard, and allowed to grow and mature, like obsidian blades that only grow sharper the more they are used. They've spread to various hands with time, branching and taking on new forms as Teks are 'mixed' with other Teks and wielded in new ways. The results are Teks associated with certain factions in the Switchboard, and this ancestral power has given them sway, by right of chalk.

As beings are conceived in the Switchboard, their calcic conjugate pulls from the Current, the collective of patterned chalk that has been formed during the lifespans of beings past, now returned to the Switchboard to be distributed to new hands across the stars. What they pull from the Current can be virtually anything, in a result that seems reminiscent of some form of fate, newborn descendants may emerge with ritual schema or Teks or maps to *somethings* implanted in their minds. Information formerly thought lost has been returned this way, and thus it is always a major affair when progeny arises in the Switchboard.

### The Black Hands
> Controlled External Influence section.

One of the unintentional results of the ritual of conjugation being a process subject to calcic mechanics is that there is a level of external control that can be exerted by parties on the growing chalk conjugate, to skew he results or induce certain changes that they desire. The reasons why one might do this vary.

A Strider obsessed with legacy may skew the conjugate such that their descendants almost certainly inherit one or many of their powers and the like. They may work to ensure their descendants inherit protocols they might bear, skills they posses, their Teks, in an effort to ensure that their progeny start their life in the Switchboard on a strong foot, predisposed almost to going far and becoming mighty.

Some are more superficial however, with some seeking to perfectly craft and shape the appearance of their descendants, going to extreme lengths to curb the randomness of the selection of traits from the donor ribbons, aiming to obtain full control of the process. Particularly, some families in the Switchboard may be obsessed with the cultivation of certain physical, though mainly aesthetic, traits that serve as identifiers for that family, and unifiers between members of it. It is often the case that ancestors in the Switchboard may seek to create progeny in their own image, or some other idealized image.

And as a final, unsavory note, there are more than a few that may work to curb the descent of certain characteristics deemed 'unfavorable', in a practice that is nigh indistinguishable from eugenics. It goes without saying that this has been used to tailor lineages based on prejudices.

It calls into question the narrative quirks of this. One is feasibility, the other is consequences.

The question that needs asking is a narrative one; should denizens of the Switchboard even be capable of interfering on a whim with the conjugation process? My answer is yes, as it gives me more tools as the creator of the narrative. That said - as with anything - I can implement rules that alter the perception of such actions and the contexts they take place in.

For one, the sheer amount and complexity of the woven chalk contained within the Five Straits and subsequently the donor conjugal ribbon means that finding and extracting a desirable trait is a strenuous exercise in fishing through very many haystacks in search of needles. The sheer tediousness of the task at the very onset, as well as the calcic difficulty of this task requiring immensely fine control and general proficiency with chalk and weaving, is mostly enough to dissuade casual contemplators of taking their hands to the conjugate. 

The narrative consequence of this is two fold; one, it explains and thus dismisses the idea that nearly everyone in the Switchboard would be working to shape the conjugate of their progeny when presented with the benefits of doing so, as doing so *properly* is immensely difficult. Two, it thus illustrates the sheer perverse dedication of those who go through with it anyway.

Perhaps the second barrier of difficulty is that of modifying the conjugate itself. The conjugate and the entire ritual of conjugation can already be viewed as bottled chaos, yet bearing the ability to realize order. A tornado passes through a junkyard and leaves behind a fully-assembled, completely functional starship; that is the ritual of conjugation. To then attempt to throw a pane of glass into it and hope it winds up as a west-facing window is the height of wishful thinking.

Notwithstanding, and as with everything, there are those driven to work around these constraints, aiming to bring elements of achievability within otherwise crushingly unfavorable odds. Modified schema for the ritual of conjugation, specialized incubators and devices, certain Teks and rare relics, all of these things have been concocted as means to wrench control from random mathematics and place it in the hands of the Machiavellian. Failure is reduced; successful modified conjugates are indeed produced, but success is not certain, and the price of failure isn't negligible.

Conjugates that have been tampered with beyond what their inherent self-correction mechanisms are able to fix often just collapse. The chalk becomes unstable, the ritual fails to sustain itself, and it explodes rather unceremoniously into dust chalk and discordant weave. This is, in fact, the best case scenario, as occasionally a conjugate can be tampered with in manners that damage it and continue to grow all the same. It can even fully form into progeny. But the wounds from tampering are still present. Some don't live very long, their lattices failing and the descendant buckling under the collapse of their calcic substructure. Some don't suffer such a fate so early, but the damage follows them well into their lives, emerging in various ways with considerable consequences.

And some conjugates are tampered with, damaged, but proceed with growing nonetheless. But when the time to produce progeny arises, something else is formed. Something warped and perverted, shaped by the desires of those who sought to exert control on things beyond their total understanding. And they may be compelled to pay for such hubris, chalk given for chalk.

**Post-Hex Discussion**
- Not personally morally responsible for what characters due with the Ritual of Conjoining, but rather only responsible if I do not condemns this somewhat, to an extent.
- Biology is complicated enough that narratively, there's plenty of room for the shadowy-cloud of 'It just works like that!'.
- A prong of eugenics is classification of traits into positive and negative. Some are easily determined to be negative (like sickle cell), while some are *considered* to be negative (such as being queer) due to...
- The social rules that exist. The point of 'securing a most viable future for a descendant by giving them the Strider Protocol' stems entirely from the societal deification of Striders. 
- Narratively, the argument made against eugenics and genetic modification (for maybe superficial reasons) has to be the insistence on life being completely livable - or even better lived - without the Strider Protocol. This links well into developing a 'Philosophy of the Grounded'; what is it like for non-Striders in the Switchboard?

## On Shape
This section discusses a 'new doctrine of shape', a manner of looking at the self as malleable in a manner not previously considered; the body being a canvas for expression of the self.

### The Lattice as a Canvas
Chalk and its nature of ribbons and weaving have allowed for an expansion of what it means to 'be' in a physical sense. Chalk allows for the realization of a more desirable, more ideal, physical form - made possible by the malleability of the chalk lattice; its ability to be reshaped by the whims of a Strider. This is the Lattice as a Canvas; the self as both the loom that spins the cloth, and the outfit it will wear.
