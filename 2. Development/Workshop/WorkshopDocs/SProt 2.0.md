# SProt 2.0
We back for more.

**What's Still 'Good'**
- Launch Threshold
- Bubble-skating
- Distance Constraints
- Arrival Maneuvers
- Initiate Fly

**What Needs Revision**
- Initiate Fly
	The SProt isn't a ritual, rather a protocol-level equation. The mechanics of the Initiate Fly gesture are a mental and physical 'priming' action. Like flexing the muscles before picking up a heavy object, the Initiate Fly is used to prepare Striders for 'heavy Strides' when necessary, or to add dramatic flair on demand.

- The Stride
	The speed of the Strider Protocol varies from 0.85c and 0.95c. Skilled Striders are able to go faster.
	  
	 The speeds of 0.951c up until 0.998c are speeds only ever achieved by the Skydancers. These are the 'holy' or 'dancer' velocities.

- Information Affinity
	This entire thing is far more suited for HandChalk. Move it there and either make it a full ability or something that is just passively done. There might be some intersection with SlateMind here.

- Preamble
	The mysticism of the Strider Protocol, as it were, outlined here would be better defined as an actual thing. A sort of 'Doctrine of Striding'. Reduce the ramifications of the Strider Protocol regarding freedom and rules and all that and focus on it mainly as what it has allowed and inspired it's bearers to do.
	
	Can the pseudo-philosophy. Just can it. Simple as.

## SProt 1.0 Old Philosophy
The Strider Protocol is the crystallization of the human desire to be free.

Put more properly, the Strider Protocol outlines the steps that make a Strider. It is a set of rules, doctrine, criteria, methodology, that governs a state of being. Most simply, the Strider Protocol has only one singular precept; a mind may escape it's bounds and gain the capacity to understand the true nature of information. All other things follow suit.

The 'Strider Protocol' as an act is the highest form of freedom. Portrayed most elementarily, it is Near-Light-Speed travel. A Strider without need for anything other than the understanding of the true nature of information, is able to manipulate their information so as to cross vast distances functionally instantaneously. The ability to do so simultaneously conquered all current frontiers, awakening new ones to pursue.

The freedom granted by the Strider Protocol and the power granted by understanding the true nature of information awoke Striders to the secrets that had always been out of reach. Powers in mundane things, the esoteric secrets that had always been out of reach, the magnificent things that could be experienced lay too far away, the Strider Protocol granted access to this and more.

It is captured in [[The Skywards Pursuit]]; the charge given to man had always been to explore, to launch out into an unknown, expansive deep, to seek knowledge and understanding for the sake of a tangible good. The Strider Protocol is that charge. It is that noble ambition transformed from mere word and feeling to tangible power.

There was an inevitable deification of the Striders and the Strider Protocol. The mere act of knowing made one more than others, and knowing more made a Strider even *more* than they initially were. Striders grasped quickly their potential to become like deities, the path for doing so being obvious; discovery of greater and greater hidden things. This relentless pursuit characterizes Striders; newborn gods leaving their weaning of milk, leaving in search of meat, by means of their holy velocities.

The Strider Protocol, by means of providing a path to power, guarantees the freedom of those who wield it, as well as it being a manifestation of the desire to be free as well. The path to power is through learning, and learning is done through exploration, further deepening its ties with human nature. To Stride is to imbibe values of humanity in their most distilled state. 

	But what *IS* the Strider Protocol? Currently, the SProt is an immensely complex equation baked into the lattiece of Striders, that facilitates Striding as one of the many powers it grants, and as an extension of its actual function - granting the power to interact with chalk at the ribbon level in the form of the WeaveProt, Teks and Rituals.


## Deprecated Flash Protocol Canon
**Legacy**
While this is true, Striders with immensely fine control over Chalk can accumulate and flare amounts of it that produce incredibly high velocity for short bursts, as well as accumulating and flaring Chalk simultaneously, drastically increasing the Strider's proficiency with Teks, Relics and other information weapons and abilities. This is the **Flash Protocol**.

The Flash Protocol's main use is immensely enhanced mobility and reactions, allowing Striders to engage at speeds several times faster than regular humans. Taken further however, Striders can accumulate and discharge an immense amount of Chalk in an indescribably short amount of time to gain fractions of a second of enhanced ability. Rapidly discharging the Chalk into equations that harness it prevent it from lingering around long enough to overwrite a Strider's information lattice.

Particularly proficient Striders can maintain the '**Flash State**' for extended periods of time, cycling Chalk in and out of themselves, enhancing all their abilities drastically. Often the deciding factor in Strider engagements before battles even start is a side's ability to invoke the Flash Protocol.
