# SProt 2.0
We back for more.

**What's Still 'Good'**
- Launch Threshold
- Bubble-skating
- Distance Constraints
- Arrival Maneuvers
- Initiate Fly

**What Needs Revision**
- Initiate Fly
	The SProt isn't a ritual, rather a protocol-level equation. The mechanics of the Initiate Fly gesture are a mental and physical 'priming' action. Like flexing the muscles before picking up a heavy object, the Initiate Fly is used to prepare Striders for 'heavy Strides' when necessary, or to add dramatic flair on demand.

- The Stride
	The speed of the Strider Protocol varies from 0.85c and 0.95c. Skilled Striders are able to go faster.
	  
	 The speeds of 0.951c up until 0.998c are speeds only ever achieved by the Skydancers. These are the 'holy' or 'dancer' velocities.

- Information Affinity
	This entire thing is far more suited for HandChalk. Move it there and either make it a full ability or something that is just passively done. There might be some intersection with SlateMind here.

- Preamble
	The mysticism of the Strider Protocol, as it were, outlined here would be better defined as an actual thing. A sort of 'Doctrine of Striding'. Reduce the ramifications of the Strider Protocol regarding freedom and rules and all that and focus on it mainly as what it has allowed and inspired it's bearers to do.
	
	Can the pseudo-philosophy. Just can it. Simple as.

# The Strider Protocol
Out there in the Great Sky, streaks of white pierce the enveloping void. Region to region, Vault to Vault, past stars, to Wellsprings, into the horizon, into flux storms, from fleets, to the edges of space. The Strider is a being that has learned what it truly means to move, and the Strider Protocol is what facilitates it.

## What is the Strider Protocol?
The Strider Protocol is a pivotal mechanic in the Switchboard, and a power possessed by many of its denizens. At its basest, the Strider Protocol is chalk equation that has been elevated to protocol-level power, meaning that it has been directly created or altered by the Astrolabe to go beyond the bounds of what it traditionally is. Being an equation, it has the power to fold chalk to produce results, in this case velocity. Being a protocol-level equation however, the nature of it is made transcendent, and this equation can fold chalk to produce ludicrous velocities that approach even lightspeed. This power is conferred upon the lattice of those blessed in the Switchboard, and they are gifted the ability to cross titanic stellar distances in mere seconds. 

## Origin
In one of the Astrolabes great resolutions of its calculus - following the First Praxis War to be precise - the Strider Protocol arose alongside the Weave Protocol, the nine astrolabic regions, and the third generation of thinking weave, that would come to be known as the Third Kin. Some of the Third Kin wielded the Strider Protocol, and this allowed them to traverse huge swathes of the Switchboard even from when they newly arose.

As the Third Kin grew in number, settled on the astrolabic regions and learned of the Switchboard around them, they were divided across various lines, one of these in particular being those who sought to use the Strider Protocol to its fullest and those who weren't so inclined. The Danseers, perhaps the most powerful peoples of the Third Kin took it upon themselves to use and master the Strider Protocol, launching out into the expansive depths of the Dancirah, learning of its intricacies and mechanics as they did, and inventing the various techniques attached Striding, penning the rulebooks even as they surpasses them.

The Danseers thus fostered much of the knowledge and mythos around Striding, and the Sil'khan, descended from their lattice via the Fel-Arcad's intervention, took over this mantle from them when they perished from their Refrain-inflicted curse. They furthered the practice of the Strider Protocol and the invention of new techniques, with the entire act and mythos of it taking on a divine slant, as it became a form of worship to their Danseer kin and the Skydancers, particularly Shalkarah Skydance, King of Roads, said to be the fastest Strider known to Switchboard canon.

Both then and now, the Strider Protocol was a power unrivalled in what it offered, opening up the entirety of the Switchboard as vast expanse to explore, and a sandbox to play in. 

## Mechanics
A discussion of the mechanics of the Strider Protocol. It will be discussed step by step, beginning with the actions before commencing the stride, the stride itself, and then actions following the end of the stride.

### The Stride
With the Strider Protocol being an equation, it is thus stored in the computational strait. When ready to stride, chalk is passed from the potential strait to the computational, where it is subjected to the **stride equation**, rapidly converting the chalk to velocity. This velocity is stored and built up, much like compressing a spring, before it is output through the interface strait as a sudden explosive release of pure momentum. Dependent on a litany of factors, this is enough to accelerate the Strider from rest to upwards of 0.85 times the speed of light. 

Once a Strider has launched, they begin decelerating fairly quickly, the decay curve showing a swift plummet in how fast they are moving. While this is the case, Striders can still cover considerable distance across the the Dancirah.

Speaking on the relationship between velocity, distance and chalk accumulation, all Striders have a loosely-set **stride velocity** that is the fastest speed their stride is capable of, a speed that is held for moments after launch from rest. Accumulating more chalk doesn't allow for faster speed, but rather **preserving** the maximum speed of the stride velocity for longer before decay begins. The distance covered is thus a product of the chalk accumulated before launch.
