# SProt 2.0
We back for more.

**What's Still 'Good'**
- Launch Threshold
- Bubble-skating
- Distance Constraints
- Arrival Maneuvers
- Initiate Fly

**What Needs Revision**
- Initiate Fly
	The SProt isn't a ritual, rather a protocol-level equation. The mechanics of the Initiate Fly gesture are a mental and physical 'priming' action. Like flexing the muscles before picking up a heavy object, the Initiate Fly is used to prepare Striders for 'heavy Strides' when necessary, or to add dramatic flair on demand.

- The Stride
	The speed of the Strider Protocol varies from 0.85c and 0.95c. Skilled Striders are able to go faster.
	  
	 The speeds of 0.951c up until 0.998c are speeds only ever achieved by the Skydancers. These are the 'holy' or 'dancer' velocities.

- Information Affinity
	This entire thing is far more suited for HandChalk. Move it there and either make it a full ability or something that is just passively done. There might be some intersection with SlateMind here.

- Preamble
	The mysticism of the Strider Protocol, as it were, outlined here would be better defined as an actual thing. A sort of 'Doctrine of Striding'. Reduce the ramifications of the Strider Protocol regarding freedom and rules and all that and focus on it mainly as what it has allowed and inspired it's bearers to do.
	
	Can the pseudo-philosophy. Just can it. Simple as.
