### Legal Systems
- **Civil Law** - The most widespread type of legal system in the world, applied in various forms in approximately 150 countries. Also referred to as European continental law, the civil law system is derived mainly from the Roman _Corpus Juris Civilus_, (Body of Civil Law), a collection of laws and legal interpretations compiled under the East Roman (Byzantine) Emperor Justinian I between A.D. 528 and 565. The major feature of civil law systems is that the laws are organized into systematic written codes. In civil law the sources recognized as authoritative are principally legislation - especially codifications in constitutions or statutes enacted by governments - and secondarily, custom. The civil law systems in some countries are based on more than one code.
- **Common Law** - A type of legal system, often synonymous with "English common law," which is the system of England and Wales in the UK, and is also in force in approximately 80 countries formerly part of or influenced by the former British Empire. English common law reflects Biblical influences as well as remnants of law systems imposed by early conquerors including the Romans, Anglo-Saxons, and Normans. Some legal scholars attribute the formation of the English common law system to King Henry II (r.1154-1189). Until the time of his reign, laws customary among England's various manorial and ecclesiastical (church) jurisdictions were administered locally. Henry II established the king's court and designated that laws were "common" to the entire English realm. The foundation of English common law is "legal precedent" - referred to as _stare decisis_, meaning "to stand by things decided." In the English common law system, court judges are bound in their decisions in large part by the rules and other doctrines developed - and supplemented over time - by the judges of earlier English courts.
- **Customary Law** - A type of legal system that serves as the basis of, or has influenced, the present-day laws in approximately 40 countries - mostly in Africa, but some in the Pacific islands, Europe, and the Near East. Customary law is also referred to as "primitive law," "unwritten law," "indigenous law," and "folk law." There is no single history of customary law such as that found in Roman civil law, English common law, Islamic law, or the Napoleonic Civil Code. The earliest systems of law in human society were customary, and usually developed in small agrarian and hunter-gatherer communities. As the term implies, customary law is based upon the customs of a community. Common attributes of customary legal systems are that they are seldom written down, they embody an organized set of rules regulating social relations, and they are agreed upon by members of the community. Although such law systems include sanctions for law infractions, resolution tends to be reconciliatory rather than punitive. A number of African states practiced customary law many centuries prior to colonial influences. Following colonization, such laws were written down and incorporated to varying extents into the legal systems imposed by their colonial powers.

#### Legacy Law
##### Fel-Arcad Law
Each arcology has their individual laws, built off of the baseline law established in the Fey Curlicue. This baseline law is compiled from the **Farsee**, the **Annals of the Eight**, and **Mouths**, that outline respectively how arcologies should operate, how individual and groups of Fel-Arcad should behave and relate, and the relationship they should have towards violence. Upon this foundation, appendum and amendments are added by individual arcologies as is needed. These combine to form the **Arcal**, the collation of all an arcology's law.

##### Crime & Punishment
> Build the Fel-Arcad government and court/legal system.

Criminal law among the Fel-Arcad is handled by their (legisjudiciary PHldr.) that is responsible for both proposing, drafting, deliberation upon, enacting and interpretation of arcology law as well as enforcement of it. These laws are written into an arcology's Arcal, the binding document of rules that all within the arcology are beheld to.

Necessary investigations and eventual punishment are handled by the Sekators, the only Fel-Arcad empowered to use violence by virtue of being specifically trained in its just application. Actual judicial proceedings are handled by the LJ.

> Following sections are somewhat tentative.

Fel-Arcad courts are somewhat familiar affairs with judges, defendants, prosecutors and a jury. Though as a point of difference, juries in one arcology are drawn from other arcologies, and it is common practice for one arcology to request for jurors from another. 

> This has been changed, and is part of a much larger redesign of how Fel-Arcad courts work. They feature triple juries, one consisting of Fel-Arcad drawn from the arcology where the incident in question took place, one consisting of Fel-Arcad drawn from other arcologies (often just one or two) and one consisting of non Fel-Arcad, meant to provide a non-Fel, outside perspective on the matter. 

Most punishments given down by Fel-Arcad courts are tempered by the fact the Fel are a philosophically-mandated pacifistic people, and thus many would consider their punishments 'soft'. Financial penalties such as fines or reductions in monetary allotments, uncompensated work, restriction of freedoms within the arcology such as access to various facilities, temporary exile - or in the worst cases - permanent exile, encompasses the majority of punishment methods afforded to the Fel-Arcad. Many families and groups within and outside of the Fel-Arcad have criticized the Fel-Arcad as 'too lenient', met with counterarguments in the form of mentioning how most 'harsher' methods are incompatible with their doctrine.

This has led to many instances of slighted Fel-Arcad who felt the punishment dealt to their offenders didn't nearly match the gravity of the offence committed, and they may be driven to seek recourse on their own terms, enacting a personal brand of justice. Exiles from an arcology may find themselves being pursued, either by their former victims who choose self-imposed exile or sneaking out of the arcology to hunt them down, or hired hands to keep their own hands clean. Feljourn in particular are invaluable for this task, their shifted, hardened perspectives shaped by living in the star-wilds makes them intrinsically understanding of seeking justice one's own way.

There are of course arcologies that embrace harsher methods of punishment, including imprisonment and occasionally even the death penalty, obtaining a mixed - but mostly disapproving - reception, by the wider Fel-Arcad community. Studies naturally exist for either side of this divide, arguing for one method over the other. Rosenthalists in particular favor harsher approaches.

##### Jurisdiction Within the Dancirah
The jurisdiction of an arcology is often a point of contention. Generally, it is accepted that the jurisdiction of an arcology ends at the physical end of the arcadia it is situated within, a boundary between legally-bound space and the unclaimed waters that remains fairly static as arcadias are often programmed to stop growing once a desired size is reached.

Fel-Arcad generally make it a point not to punish offenders for crimes against them if those offenders are not subject to arcology jurisdiction. A crime committed by a non-Fel against a Fel-Arcad within the bounds of arcology space is handled by that arcology, and punishment is meted out to the offender by the arcology's administration due to the fact visiting an arcology is done with the awareness and thus acceptance of being bound by arcology law. 

Offences committed outside an arcology's jurisdiction against a member of that arcology are handled somewhat differently. Investigations are carried out to find the nature of the offence and the perpetrators, and then this information is passed over the arcology's External Affairs. EA contacts relevant parties that the perpetrator is subject too - such as another arcology in the case of a Fel-Arcad offender - and issues their demands regarding a desire for punishment and the degree of severity in its dispensation. Noncompliance is met with sanctions from the Fel-Arcad, often in the form of trade refusal by the relevant arcology and other arcologies that feel so inclined. The economic value of the Fel-Arcad sees that their demands are often answered sooner rather than later.
