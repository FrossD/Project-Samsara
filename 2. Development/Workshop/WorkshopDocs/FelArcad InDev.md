### Legal Systems
- **Civil Law** - The most widespread type of legal system in the world, applied in various forms in approximately 150 countries. Also referred to as European continental law, the civil law system is derived mainly from the Roman _Corpus Juris Civilus_, (Body of Civil Law), a collection of laws and legal interpretations compiled under the East Roman (Byzantine) Emperor Justinian I between A.D. 528 and 565. The major feature of civil law systems is that the laws are organized into systematic written codes. In civil law the sources recognized as authoritative are principally legislation - especially codifications in constitutions or statutes enacted by governments - and secondarily, custom. The civil law systems in some countries are based on more than one code.
- **Common Law** - A type of legal system, often synonymous with "English common law," which is the system of England and Wales in the UK, and is also in force in approximately 80 countries formerly part of or influenced by the former British Empire. English common law reflects Biblical influences as well as remnants of law systems imposed by early conquerors including the Romans, Anglo-Saxons, and Normans. Some legal scholars attribute the formation of the English common law system to King Henry II (r.1154-1189). Until the time of his reign, laws customary among England's various manorial and ecclesiastical (church) jurisdictions were administered locally. Henry II established the king's court and designated that laws were "common" to the entire English realm. The foundation of English common law is "legal precedent" - referred to as _stare decisis_, meaning "to stand by things decided." In the English common law system, court judges are bound in their decisions in large part by the rules and other doctrines developed - and supplemented over time - by the judges of earlier English courts.
- **Customary Law** - A type of legal system that serves as the basis of, or has influenced, the present-day laws in approximately 40 countries - mostly in Africa, but some in the Pacific islands, Europe, and the Near East. Customary law is also referred to as "primitive law," "unwritten law," "indigenous law," and "folk law." There is no single history of customary law such as that found in Roman civil law, English common law, Islamic law, or the Napoleonic Civil Code. The earliest systems of law in human society were customary, and usually developed in small agrarian and hunter-gatherer communities. As the term implies, customary law is based upon the customs of a community. Common attributes of customary legal systems are that they are seldom written down, they embody an organized set of rules regulating social relations, and they are agreed upon by members of the community. Although such law systems include sanctions for law infractions, resolution tends to be reconciliatory rather than punitive. A number of African states practiced customary law many centuries prior to colonial influences. Following colonization, such laws were written down and incorporated to varying extents into the legal systems imposed by their colonial powers.

**The Shape of Fel-Arcad Law**

Built off of the English common law.

2. **Legal Structure**
The Fel-Arcad possess a legal architecture featuring tiered courts. Each court grows in prominence and the kinds of legal matters it can handle, presiding over larger numbers of Fel-Arcad, and greater levels of legal dispute.

Regarding the tiers of courts, there are four;

- **District Benches**, which serve the individual districts of an arcology. In an arcology's topology, a **district** is a collection of **blocs**, with blocs being the smallest unit of measurement for arcology living. District Benches serve the district, and districts are made up of a number of blocs. These benches work often as mediators on the smallest issues spanning upwards, such as contract disputes, personal injury cases, family law and the like, moving upwards to smaller scale criminal cases.

- **Wing Courts**, which serve an arcology's wings. Wings are collections of districts, and thus Wing Courts oversee a larger share of an arcology's population. Affairs that begin in the District Benches can be escalated to the Wing Courts if deemed necessary, as Wing Courts deal primarily in manners of legal review. That being said, Wing Courts do conduct trials of their own, in cases where it is agreed more legal muscle is required. Wing Courts handle large-scale criminal and civil cases as is necessary.

- **Nadiran High Courts**, which are the highest legal institution within an arcology, serving to represent all the peoples of that arcology and the arcology itself. Matters that reach insufficient resolution in the Wing Courts are resolved here, and the Nadiran Court largely does legal review of the decisions made by lower courts rather than conduct much legal theater of its own. That being said, in affairs that involve non-arcology denizens, such as a civil or criminal suit involving non-Fel, they are handled exclusively at the Nadiran High Courts. For this reason, they work closely with External Affairs.

- **The Rosenthal Court of the Fallen**, the final tier of court, and the highest legal authority recognized by the Fel-Arcad. Sequestered at the Second Arcology at Sanscrii, the Fallen Justices are elected by all Fel-Arcad the Switchboard over, and serve the Fel-Arcad as the final arbiters of justice. All decisions made by them are law. On the administrative front, they are the authority that presides over the contents of the **Arcal**, revising and making amendments to it as necessary. For these many reasons, much of the Fel-Arcad's power is spent in protecting these figures from external powers that seek to interfere with the proceedings of the court.

3. **Role of Judges**
Fel-Arcad courts are presided over by multiple judges at the bench, all who serve various functions in the entirety of the process.

- **Legal Proceedings**; They work as impartial arbiters over the entire affair, give rulings on issues that arise in proceedings using their wealth of expertise, manage witnesses and evidence, and settle matters both before and after the trial concludes, such as motions to dismiss. Thy additionally pass judgement at the end of the affair if necessary.
- **Jury Handling**; Judges are involved with the jury, both in the selection process and in educating them in their duties once selected.
- **Trial Proceedings**; Judges work to maintain order from the bench, especially in the case of particularly impassioned cases. They generally work to provide oversight of the entire affair, to ensure that the legal theater is played as by the book is possible.

As one ascends the ladder of Fel-Arcad courts, the number of judges at the bench increases. District Benches have **four judges**, and in decisions that require judges to vote, a three vote majority is needed for a decision to be made. Wing Courts seat **six judges** and need a **four-two majority**. Nadiran High Courts seat **eight** and need a **five-three** majority to reach a decision.

The Rosenthal Court of the Fallen seats **nine** supreme justices, and an **seven-two** majority is needed to pass a decision. Due to the weightiness of the matters decided by the Fallen Court, it is paramount that as many on the bench agree with a decision made as possible.

4. **Role of Juries**
In an overwhelming majority of Fel-Arcad legal proceedings, a jury is called for and assembled. 

Jury selection is the first task, and begins with determining eligibility. The pool for determining eligibility is by default, the entire population of the arcology or arcologies most relevant to the case. The first stage of selection is twofold; an opportunity to opt in to the service, and a written exam that must be taken by all who are eligible. This exam is a general knowledge test meant to asses a level of intelligence, a civics test to determine how learned one is about legal proceedings, and a no-wrong-answers test about morality. 

Selection is undertaken in a familiar manner; that of '**voire dire**', a selection process used to determine the biases within individual potential jurors. This is done via questioning the jurors, and working to determine if their background, experiences, beliefs and/or connections with the case or the parties involved might present a conflict of interest, rendering them incapable of being fair to the parties involved. Should the acting legal counsel present a tangible case why a juror should be dismissed, it is left to the panel of sitting judges to deliberate and approve or deny the decision.

A core difference is that under the Fel-Arcad, they are not given **preemptory challenges**, as their usage is rife with concealed, plausibly deniable biases.

Fel-Arcad legal scholars have always shaped the legal system such that the jury takes a slightly different approach. Fel-Arcad juries consist of **twelve members selected from the arcology or arcologies most relevant to the case**, as well as **six additional jurors** who have **lived minimally in arcologies** in their lifetime. The reason for this is that it is widely postulated arcologies breed a form of 'moral uniformity' among the Fel-Arcad that is good for running society, but may be suboptimal for judging those who flout it. Those who haven't dwelt in arcologies are thus brought on to give an otherwise unobtainable perspective. 

For the Fel-Arcad pool, they have four alternates, and two for the non-arcology pool, resulting in **twenty four jurors** in all. In cases involving multiple arcologies, the Fel-Arcad pool is divided into a larger and smaller pool, with the larger pool being drawn from the arcology the defendant is most tied to, this often being a 60% split in their favor. If three arcologies are involved, it can be split 50-25-25 in the defendant's favor. This in pursuit of the philosophy of 'jury of their peers', with peers being very much a product of the arcology one has dwelt in.

The task of the jury after their selection is, summarized, to reach a verdict. This they will do through being the audience of what could be a very long bout of legal theater. In this time, the courts and auxiliary legal institutions will work towards preserving their safety and compensating them for the time spent. In the court room they will be presented the evidence, question witnesses, discuss facts, and ultimately deliberate upon the matter. If a verdict is not reached, they will be given time to deliberate again, and again, again, until a decision is reached. In all this they are to remain fair and impartial, and work towards the delivery of justice - in whatever form that may be.

5. **Legal Codes and Statutes**
The legal codes and statutes adhered to by the Fel-Arcad are encoded in the **Arcal**, which is an expanded compendium of documents featuring material taken from the **Annals of the Eight**, **Mouths that Spit and Sing**, and **The Farseer's Lament**.

The Arcal is divided into various super-sections, sections and subsections, dealing with a litany of subject matters, civil and criminal, from the conduct of individuals to that of all Fel-Arcad. It outlines the structure of government and the extent of each branch's powers, and contains a supremacy clause that declares it the supreme doctrine the Fel-Arcad must adhere to. It contains information on how to amend the Arcal, adding additional clauses and the like where necessary; as the people who are subject to it grow and evolve, so too does the document they are subject to.

Revisions and amendments to the Arcal are made by the Fallen Justices that sit in the Rosenthal Court of the Fallen at Sanscrii. As with other decisions, a seven-two majority of the justices is needed to reach a decision on what changes should be made to the Arcal.

10. Punishment and Sentencing
Criminal law among the Fel-Arcad is handled by their (legisjudiciary PHldr.) that is responsible for both proposing, drafting, deliberation upon, enacting and interpretation of arcology law as well as enforcement of it. These laws are written into an arcology's Arcal, the binding document of rules that all within the arcology are beheld to.

Necessary investigations and eventual punishment are handled by the Sekators, the only Fel-Arcad empowered to use violence by virtue of being specifically trained in its just application. 

When a jury reaches a verdict in a Fel-Arcad trial, they have the opportunity to either determine the severity of the punishment among themselves, or waive that right and leave sentencing to the judges overseeing the case.

Most punishments given down by Fel-Arcad courts are tempered by the fact the Fel are a philosophically-mandated pacifistic people, and thus many would consider their punishments 'soft'. Financial penalties such as fines or reductions in monetary allotments, uncompensated work, restriction of freedoms within the arcology such as access to various facilities, temporary exile - or in the worst cases - permanent exile, encompasses the majority of punishment methods afforded to the Fel-Arcad. Many families and groups within and outside of the Fel-Arcad have criticized the Fel-Arcad as 'too lenient', met with counterarguments in the form of mentioning how most 'harsher' methods are incompatible with their doctrine.

This has led to many instances of slighted Fel-Arcad who felt the punishment dealt to their offenders didn't nearly match the gravity of the offence committed, and they may be driven to seek recourse on their own terms, enacting a personal brand of justice. Exiles from an arcology may find themselves being pursued, either by their former victims who choose self-imposed exile or sneaking out of the arcology to hunt them down, or hired hands to keep their own hands clean. Feljourn in particular are invaluable for this task, their shifted, hardened perspectives shaped by living in the star-wilds makes them intrinsically understanding of seeking justice one's own way.

There are of course arcologies that embrace harsher methods of punishment, including imprisonment and occasionally even the death penalty, obtaining a mixed - but mostly disapproving - reception, by the wider Fel-Arcad community. Studies naturally exist for either side of this divide, arguing for one method over the other. Rosenthalists in particular favor harsher approaches.

11. Legal Institutions
The auxiliary non-court legal institutions such as law enforcement agencies and correctional facilities are the domain of an arcology's **Sekators**. Being the only Fel-Arcad allowed to perform acts of violence within tightly-controlled bounds, they are thus necessary at various stages in the legal process, such as arrests, investigations, moving relevant parties from locale to locale, protection of relevant parties, case-relevant materials such as evidence, and the physical locations relevant to cases, such as crime scenes and the actual court building.

In addition, the Sekators enforce whatever sentence is levied against the convict. Exiles and imprisonments are overseen by the Sekators, and in arcologies where more severe methods are employed, the Sekators oversee these as well.

It is worth noting that the monopoly the Sekators have over violence thus makes them uniquely liable for excessive harms done in its usage, established through continuous reviews of Sekator conduct by relevant bodies.

12. Appeals and Review
It is the right of all Fel-Arcad who are dissatisfied with a ruling to escalate the matter in the form of an appeal to a higher court. This is only doable when circumstances facilitate it however, and these circumstances must be established in the form of an appeal proposal.

If it can be established, for example, that there were considerable errors made in proceedings by various parties, this is grounds for an appeal. Other grounds include errors of procedure and process, allegations of bias, excessive sentencing, conflict of law and jurisdiction, and the appearance of new evidence. When a case is sufficiently made, the next court on the ladder can take the case up for review.

The conclusive list for grounds of appeal is as follows;
1. Errors of Law
2. Misconduct or Bias
3. Procedural Errors
4. New Evidence
5. Inadequate Legal Representation
6. Excessive or Inappropriate Sentencing
7. Errors in Jury Instructions
8. Constitutional Violations
9. Jurisdictional Issues
10. Abuse of Discretion
11. Conflict of Laws
12. Errors in Findings of Fact

While measures are taken to curtail each of these, the system - even the Fel-Arcad's - is imperfect, and as such it is important that measures exist to demand lookovers of various legal decisions.

The highest court among the Fel-Arcad is the Rosenthal Court of the Fallen, and their decision is final.
