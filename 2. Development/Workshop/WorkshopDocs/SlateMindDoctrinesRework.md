# SlateMind and Doctrines Rework
In and out, 20 minutes.

**Ideas**
- Doctrines, Praxis, Praxis Powers, the Current and the Astrolabe all interact in some manner.
	- Something about calcic dividends being paid because of doctrine, through the Current.

**Outline**
What needs talking about/doing.

- The Doctrinal Core
	Deprecated in some capacity. The old doctrinal core mechanics were very Strider-centric and thus mostly incompatible with a lot of the Switchboard's denizens. This section mostly talked about what doctrines where meant to be, but it really just winds and spins until getting to the very end, at which point it does become kind of coherent, but still needs rewriting.
	  
	Easy path forward here is to deprecate the concept of doctrinal 'cores'. Doctrines don't sit at the heart of being or any such shit. 

- Doctrinal Powers
	This section means to talk about two things;
	- How doctrines affect Striders' powers.
	- How doctrines affect other doctrines.
	Some changes need to be made though. Doctrines and thus doctrinal powers are not exclusive to Striders, which needs to be explained, and doctrines interact under **praxis mechanics** which describes how doctrines are 'wielded' and thus used against each other.

- Doctrines and Bayesianity
	Bayesianity has aged poorly I feel, and hasn't really been used in any tangible way in the Samsara canon. I'll have to review things, but it's something I wish, in this moment, speaking rather impulsively, that I wish I could excise. 

And yet,

The LTK stuff actually still kind of works, I've just kind of left it in the dust. To make it more 'current' with the rest of Samsara, I'm considering integrating it into what is gradually becoming Samsara's meta-level power system.
- See about integrating the entire LTK mechanics with doctrines, and thus with Praxis systems.
- Something about the knowledge acquired by an individual Strider enhances or supplements doctrine, and this in turn can be wielded under Praxis mechanics.

How does this affect the Dilemma of 'Mass Knowing'? It can perhaps be a thing where the power provided to an individual by a piece of knowledge is reduced if more people know it, but is increased somewhat if more people who share their doctrine also know it. Something like supplying power to your allies at the cost of your own.

- Strider Evolution and The Mysticism
I might just straight up bin this shit.

**LTK Detailed**
**Knowledge**
- There is a fundamental disconnect here from the get-go, that comes from devising a system, deprecating it, designing a better system from the ashes of the old, and not fully letting go of what made the old system no longer ideal, partially from not realizing what those things were.
- This disconnect was that, formerly, power in the Switchboard came from 'Knowing'. That simply Knowing things was power, but this is disconnected from the fact that Weave and Warfare outlines power in the Switchboard in a manner that makes no use of the LTK systems.
- Thus, we can either deprecate what we have here or repurpose it. I vote to repurpose it. We move the Knowledge-Power Interplay to be handled at the doctrinal level and to be utilizable by praxis.
- What this means is that, the entire mechanisms of secrets providing power is something that is handled by doctrines; the discovery of a secret or the acquisition of some knowledge serves to fuel a **personal doctrine of the self**, which is a sort of culmination of various other doctrines acquired over the course of being. This doctrine of the self is what is levied when utilizing praxis, and this doctrine of the self is reinforced by other doctrines it draws upon.
- A result of this is that the power gleaned from knowledge is less so a passive buff, and more so employed when needed, such as in combat. Levying doctrine against doctrine has the risk of damaging one's own doctrine, as its failure reveals its fallibility. 

**Power**
- The praxis powers are a toolkit of ways the dividends of doctrine can be used.
- Their major uses are passive buffs to strength, active buffs to attacks, and the ability to sustain the self on doctrine alone.

**The Personal Doctrine of the Self // Bayesianity**
- Strangely, Bayes makes a comeback here.
- The PDotS is maximally powerful when it is maximally bayesian.
- Incredible.
- I don't believe it.
- Simple as?
- Simple as.

Doctrines and Bayesianity work like, doctrines are beliefs formed, and these beliefs formed are inspired, made to exist almost, by how the perceiver perceives the world around them. Seeing patterns. Doctrines are formed from observing patterns, but this 'forming' is only bayesian if the correlation between patterns actually exists.

Thus, if I formed a doctrine around not wearing red shirts because it rained last time I did, there is indeed a pattern, but very poor if not zero demonstrable correlation.

> Make Grand Mechanica less Strider-centric.

**Doc Rebuilding**
- Axle of Axles
	- Either I kill it or rebuild it by linking the parts of other docs to it to rebuild it, as it is mostly a summary doc anyway.
- Grand Mechanica
	- This stuff has aged fairly well, we merely need to repurpose it. 
Think that's all.

**Final Outline For SlateMind**
> Do I actually just combine SlateMind and Grand Mechanica? Real talk.

- All the Grand Mechanica shit as it is very foundational stuff that explains how chalk kinda works but not really? It's the bedrock of the meta-powersystem that all of this is building towards? I just feel it gotta come first.
- Talk about Doctrines.
	- How doctrines are formed.
	- Personal doctrines.
	- Growing the strength of a doctrine through Power obtained from Knowledge via the Bayes mechanics.
- Praxis Powers
	- What they are
	- How they work as the Switchboards meta-power
	- Why they work (this is the bit on the Astrolabe, the Current, dividends of doctrine and ledgers)

Tentative further notes;
- Doctrines usable by those without the SProt or WProt.
- The Mysticism and Strider Evolution come back.
	- I really feel like binning them.
