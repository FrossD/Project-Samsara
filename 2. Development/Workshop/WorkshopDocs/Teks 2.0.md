The Weave Protocol grants its bearers command over chalk and all things calcic. The Switchboard's Chalkweavers are able to interface directly with its underlying mechanics, interacting with phenomena 'at the ribbon level' as the lowest level at which calcic interaction happens is described. To make ribbon chalk into anything useful, **folding** and **weaving** it into patterns and weaves is necessary, performed through physical  with the hands, devices designed to work with chalk, or rituals that take in chalk and components to fold complex patterns of chalk into being.

But there are levels of weave complexity that are nigh impossible to achieve through other means. Examples are the various calcic machinations that are performed by the Astrolabe, or the workings of a region's calcic interior. While the effects of these machinations can be seen, what produces these effects rarely can - and most of, all can rarely ever be grasped. This is the domain of **equations**; chalk that has grown so proficient at folding chalk through their irreducible complexity that the results of its machinations appears to defy what is understood about chalk and the Weave Protocol. The Strider and Weave Protocols themselves are good examples of this.
