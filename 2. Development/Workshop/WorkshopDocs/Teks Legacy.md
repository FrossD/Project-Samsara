## Teks
Teks are Chalk Equations that channel Latent Chalk as well as Chalk within a Strider, according to internal parameters, to produce external changes. Dropping the pretense, Teks are functionally the same as magical abilities, though I add (defensively) considerably more thought behind them.

> Teks can be read as 'techniques'.

### The Nature of Teks
Teks being Chalk Equations makes them subject to the same rules that chalk itself is, particularly that of arising spontaneously. Though they can also be artificially created, most Teks form in the crystalline chalk deposits of the Wellsprings, dragged up by currents and beginning a slow wander across the Sky, usually to be captured and encased in crystalline chalk elsewhere.

Teks function using the Five-Straits. As having the ability to use a Tek requires Knowing, Teks are stored in the Memory Line. They draw from the potential line where a Strider either uses internal or Latent Chalk to fuel the Tek, and pass instruction to the interpreter line that interprets the equations of the Tek to the computational line, which combines data supplied from the interface line, and outputs the result of those calculations through the interface line. 

### Categories of Teks
Teks are primarily powers wielded by Striders in combat, though Teks vary widely in what they are able to do. Teks for combat are classified into four categories, with names for the Striders that use them, though it must also be mentioned Teks have use outside purely combat as well;
- **Sequencer Teks**
	- Used by **Strider Sequencers**. Sequencer Teks work by copying ('sequencing') chalk equations and replicating them for use by the Strider. Teks here are fairly elementary, resembling elemental arcane powers such as summoning fire and lightning.
- **Vector Manipulation Teks**
	- Used by **Strider Redirectors**. Grant control over all quantities with magnitude and direction. Elementary Redirectors can typically only modify direction, with more advanced Teks allowing altering magnitude as well. Can turn a light tap on the ground into a teeth-rattling shockwave.
- **Assembly and Disassembly Teks**
	- Used by **Strider Psychitects**. The power to form constructs out of pure chalk and mathematics, as well as disassemble them. More advanced Teks allows for finer control and greater intricacy of what is formed. Elementary forms allows for making barriers or dismantling obstacles, more refined, allows for creating blades or firearms.
- **Modification Teks**
	- Used by **Strider Augmenters**. Much like playing support in a game; enhancing the abilities of others as well as preexisting abilities held by the Strider themselves. Advanced eyesight. Better hearing. Boosted agility and reflexes. Faster and more parallel thinking. Accelerated regeneration.
Additionally;
- **Esoteric Teks**
	- Used by **Strider Esoterics**. These Teks exist outside conventional classification, acting more as wildcards. Some stand alone, while others modify the preexisting categories of Teks. Examples are pure teleportation and mental powers. 

### Teks and Striders
The complex nature of Teks means that though many Teks exist, Striders typically only know one or two, as this constraint is place on them by their Memory Lines. Attempting to learn more has the same effect as accumulating too much chalk when attempting to Stride; overwriting essential information with noise and randomness.

An unintentional side-effect of this is that Striders known for using certain Teks accumulate renown or notoriety, the result of which is elaborated upon with [[The Cyclicality of Names |Strider Ballads]]. Striders with particularly powerful and well-known Teks may knowingly or unknowingly cultivate groups of other Striders that follow them, and by virtue of Strider Evolution, may develop weaker versions of the Tek they posses. It leads to the formation of 'cults' of Striders, all using powers similar to that of their leader's. 

Some Striders choose to accept that Teks function indisputably similarly to fictional arcane powers, and thusly take arcane titles (such as mage, wizard, alchemist, spell-blade) for aesthetic purposes. Under the concept of[[The Cyclicality of Names | Strider Titles]] however, Striders particularly skilled at using their Teks may gain arcane titles and the titular powers associated with them.

### Obtaining Teks
Teks are intricately patterned Chalk that forms equations, which take the shape of wieldable powers used by Striders as tools or as weapons in combat. An essential part of the growth of a Strider to power and prominence is finding and mastering a Tek, which then raises the question of how Teks can be found.

Teks being Chalk equations work under the same principles as Chalk, particularly the ones outlined under '**Spontaneous Equations**' in [[The Hands as Chalk]]. Teks form from Latent Chalk that accumulates and due to a certain amount of internal self-correction, grow, change, and evolve over time into coherent, functional equations. 

> As a random thought, it would make sense logically if the evolution of latent chalk to a Tek would be truly completed through further refinement by Striders. It seems somewhat - if not fairly - absurd that the ability to, for example, form balls of fire is just a 'thing' that 'becomes' even if it takes considerable time and happens in favorable conditions. Narratively, it further works to stress Teks as not just a thing Striders 'do', but in ways, they 'are'. A Strider *is* their Tek because their Tek is most likely unique, and almost synonymous with their name, often being the means by which they are recognized.

Where are Teks formed then? Primarily, in Wellsprings. Law Stars emit pure streams of Chalk endlessly, which accumulate in regions, saturating them with the raw potential of unharnessed chalk. These regions - the Wellsprings - are where Teks form over long periods of time. 

	As an appendum, if all that is needed for Teks to form is latent chalk and time, then it is fair to say they aren't exclusive to the Wellsprings. What truly are the limits to where a Tek can generate? Can there be a regional Tek, created by the proximity of people in the region or the regional equation itself, to a crystalline deposit of chalk?
	
	It seems perfectly rational that Vaults would thave Teks within them as well, placed there by the Minds that created the Vault, slipping into them from riding on chalk currents, or evolving over time in the information-dense environments they present.

How then are Teks found? Teks typically reach near-completion in the same general area the evolution process began, meaning that a vast majority of Teks are hidden or encased in layers and layers of chalk, making them hard to detect. Teks are ordered chalk, but ordered in a manner that doesn't make it easily distinguishable from unordered, random Chalk. 

To answer a complex question simply, finding a Tek is a matter of identifying negentropy; 'negative chaos'. It is finding pi or Avogadro's number or the gravitational constant in a sea of random numbers. Doing so without any aid is nigh impossible, and so tools, tricks and just plain experience create the divide between Striders who can find Teks as though they called out their names, and Striders who never see one in their lifetime. 

To answer a complex question with the equivalent complexity it deserves, imagine travelling across a frozen tundra, sheets of ice as far as the eyes can see. Blizzards strike - seemingly - whenever they choose. Altitude varies, with valleys featuring colder temperatures leading into mountains promising deadly exposure. And then, without explanation, you find a patch of verdant, green grass. Next to it, a larger patch. Next to *that*, an even larger patch, this one with flowers blooming pleasantly within it. You follow these patches until they merge and grow, becoming a large field - and at the center of it - a pool of clear, steaming hot water.

This is a more obvious Tek. It alters the environment around it indisputably, in a manner visible to all who take a casual glance. In homogeneity of the icy wastes, any deviation from the expected is most rationally explained by esoteric factors. It is similar in the Switchboard; a Tek may shape the environment around - sometimes dangerously - and Striders are tasked with locating the abstract 'center' of the deviation, and retrieve the Tek from within.

Some Teks, however, are more complex.

Returning to the frozen tundra, suppose you set up a monitoring facility and observed the tundra for three months (108 days, as a Switchboard 'month' is 36 days). You chart the resulting data and find... oddities. Blizzards hit on the sixth and eighteenth of each month. Snowdrifts grew and shrank by multiples of seventeen. Auroras hit at the start of every month. Polar animals migrated in pack sizes of ascending prime numbers, following zig-zagging paths at alternating angles. It is far too much coincidence, something greater must be at work. 

Noticing these intricacies without conscious measurement will undoubtedly take time, and noticing some (such as Auroras at the start of every month) are somewhat explainable away, prompting no further inquiry. However, a discerning mind will able to observe these occurrences and draw a more apt conclusion; a line of negentropy - 'anti-chaos' - in the cacophony.

Finding Teks is a test of a Strider's ability to find patterns, consistencies, similarities, in deluges of chalk.
