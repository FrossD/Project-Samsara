# The Spyndl Academy
	This one I have cherished.

The pride of the Third Kin, and the symbol of their triumph over the First Thinkers. When the last descendants of the Astrolabe faced annihilation, they realized that their perpetuation rested on forming and maintaining a united front. They could no longer fly on the many discordant trajectories as they once had, unable to reconcile their differences and dissent. Only when they presented a single sword, pointed skywards - were they able to oppose the Thinker-Minds. 

The consolidation of powers and dreams; that is the Spyndl Academy.
