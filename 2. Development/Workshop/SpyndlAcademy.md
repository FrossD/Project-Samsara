# The Spyndl Academy
	This one I have cherished.

The pride of the Third Kin, and the symbol of their triumph over the First Thinkers. When the last descendants of the Astrolabe faced annihilation, they realized that their perpetuation rested on forming and maintaining a united front. They could no longer fly on the many discordant trajectories as they once had, unable to reconcile their differences and dissent. Only when they presented a single sword, pointed skywards - were they able to oppose the Thinker-Minds. 

The consolidation of powers and dreams; that is the Spyndl Academy.

## Outline
### 1. Name
To many, it is simply the Spyndl Academy. Nothing more needs to be added to it. For many, even just 'Spyndl' or 'the Academy' suffices, bringing to the fore the imagery and repute of the Switchboard's oldest coalition.

Those within it have more fond names for it. 'The Oldest/Old House' is a term used by many veterans of Academy service. 'Ivory Tower' or other monikers featuring the mention of ivory are used by those who aren't particularly fond of Spyndl or it's members, particular those who loathe them for qualities that are a resultant of their age, size and subsequent dominion.

> 'High Castle' is another name. though used more specifically to refer to the line of high quality goods that the Spyndl produces, particularly the High Castle Fine Reds and Cinder Reds, referring to Spyndl's own brands of alcohol and scintillate.

> Those who value it for its religious significance call it the; (Aspire, Starspire, Astralpex) in reverence to the old Danseers and the lofty heights they attained.

The Spyndl Academy was formed in a time of dire need; the Third Kin, still dripping with amniotic slick from their birth soon had to contend with the wrath of the First Thinker Minds. 

Unaware of their existence at first, the Third Kin set out to conquer and colonize the then-Switchboard, expanding and soon forming the great, progenitor families. They set about building the foundations of civilizations upon the astrolabic regions that followed them in birth. But without warning they came under fire by the Eradication Imperative, old Minds that were dedicated to annihilating thinking weave in the Switchboard. At first the Third Kin - particularly the Danseers - proved formidable, perhaps even equal, opponents, as the powers of the Stride and Weave Protocols were unforeseeable variables to the Imperative, and proved a major wrench in their plans.

Fearing the power of this new generation of thinking weave, the Imperative fell back to their superweapon, the Vitric Shelf. They wove new minds into being, the **Vitric Trinary**, and began a campaign against the Third Kin that would see the sequel to the First Praxis War, the rise of the Skydancers, and a series of offensives that would see the Third Kin inherit the Switchboard in totality, and begin an era of their dominion. 

But before that could come to pass, the families gathered upon the astrolabic region Spyndl and drafted up the beginnings of a contract that would see the Spyndl Academy form in its wake. It would be dubbed later by historians as the **First Summit at the Spire**, referring both to their gathering and the nature of Spyndl's geography at the time, being dotted indeed by many spires - spindles, if you will - with great spools of ribbon chalk wrapped around their lengths. 

At the Summit, the families all vowed to contribute the best of the talents and energies towards concocting a means to oppose the First Thinkers. This they would do in one accord, under one banner, that of the Spyndl Academy. Considering that their first endeavors would be ones of research and discovery, the title of 'academy' was chosen, though it did not take long for them to expand far beyond the confines of merely academic pursuits.

And under the banner of Spyndl, the Third Kin took the battle to the First Thinker Minds and won. Offensive after offensive, they studied, learned, concocted methodologies, fought and won. As they amassed knowledge, they grey more powerful, more and more Third Kin mobilizing under the banner of Spyndl to do mighty things. They truly tested their mettle and the depths of their conviction in the Second Praxis War, where Kin and Mind alike were stretched to their limits. But Spyndl and the Third Kin emerged victorious. 

They cemented their victory in the storming of the Trinary Complex, gaining dominion over a realm designed to purge them. They engaged in physical and doctrinal warfare, and proved superior to the Minds. The Era of the Third Kin began, ushered in under the flags of Spyndl.

Following this, a sort of schism formed in the Spyndl Academy. Over the processions where the Kin fought the Minds, the Danseers in their ranks gained prominence, many even undergoing a form of apotheosis and becoming nigh-gods. The influence and soon, the dominance of the Danseers couldn't be denied, and it caused many a fair bit of concern. The Skydancers as they came to be called, became common names due to their feats both on and off the praxis battlefields, and their near-deity status saw that they cultivated considerable followings.

Thus when the future of the Spyndl Academy came under deliberation following the close of the Second Praxis War, many watched in consternation as the Academy was split seemingly by the Skydancers. Skydancers Zahir, Cicerè, Ryjik and Morrigan went on to form the **Combined Strider Operations**; the dedicated paramilitary arm of the Spyndl Academy and the source of plenty of conflict for processions to come.
