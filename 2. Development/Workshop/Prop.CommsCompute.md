### Calcodynamics and Vitreodynamics Interplay
> Required reading;
> [[The Hands as Chalk]]
> [[Glass]]

Chalk and glass interact destructively - or rather in a negentropic manner; when glass encounters chalkweave, it works towards 'regularizing' it, by destructively simplifying it and propagating more of itself in the void of entropy created. It works almost like a virus, destroying host chalk as it propagates itself, and spreading to devour more and more weave.

![[Glass#^cfe87b]]

However;

![[Glass#^ab6fc2]]

In a sense, 'glass cannot abide chalk' is better stated as '**under certain conditions, glass cannot abide chalk**' - which naturally implies that there are circumstances under which it *can*. Generally, the negentropic reaction between glass and chalk is a product of two major parameters;
- The complexity of the calcic sample.
- The purity of the glass in question.

And a number of minor ones;
- The shape of glass and chalk in question.
- Ambient calcic and vitric conditions.
- Non-natural interfering factors such as chalk ritualism.

With that established, it is possible for chalk and glass to interact in minimally destructive and even relatively *constructive* manners, based on control and modification of the relevant parameters. There are even cases and circumstances where stable **chalk-glass complexes** can be in nature, and they can be used in a litany of ways just like many of the Switchboard's other esoteric materials.

How to harness chalk-glass complexes then, is a matter of ingenuity, and one such examples of this is in the creation of **glasswire**.

### Glasswire
With a fair bit of precision, one can create a chalk-glass complex in the shape of a hollow tube, and then shove a round slug of chalk-glass complex into it, this slug having differing percentages of chalk and glass in its make-up than the surrounding chalk-glass tube. Upon the edge of the slug touching the lip of the tube, a small negentropic reaction takes place that converts a minuscule amount of chalk in the tube to glass, but in doing so reduces the amount of chalk at that section of the slug. Glass, in its **praxis-dictated** hunger for chalk, seeks to consume more chalk, and in doing so exerts an **attractive force** on quantities of it, which serves to pull the slug forward, and consume more of the chalk in its makeup. Once it reaches the end of the tube, the slug would have reduced minimally in mass and size, as the outer layer of the chalk-glass complex has been stripped off.

This peculiar behavior is observed only in chalk-glass complexes, that being that when chalk is introduced, glass seems to obtain the ability to **passively harness its praxis properties** as encoded in the Astrolabe's ontological ledgers. The result of this is samples of chalk-glass that recognize their own impurity, and thus work towards rectifying that by consuming chalk in the vicinity and converting it to glass, in doing so, raising the percentage and thus purity of glass in its make-up, allowing it to deplete the minuscule chalk present in its complex structure, to become pure glass. It is this attractive force of glass' hunger that can be harnessed to send objects down ducts of glasswire.

It was theorized then, that if a lattice of glasswire exists, it would be possible to send bits of weave down them, like messages written on paper in plastic tubes, fired down larger, pressurized air ducts. One would have to design a format of 'package' to send down these glasswires however, and this would indeed come later.

> It wouldn't be too farfetched to say that chalk-glass displays a kind of capillary action with varying purities of itself, and this model in mind aids greatly in understanding the functionality of glasswire. 

### The Braced-Weft Packet Doctrine
Referring to old notes;
![[The Hands as Chalk#Pattern and 'Ribbon' Duality]]

The section above on pattern-ribbon duality tells us about the dual nature of chalk in woven and ribbon form. An object can indeed be 'unfolded' down to calcic ribbon, and should a sufficient equation be provided, it is then possible to 'refold' that ribbon back into the original object. 

It is worth remembering that interactions in the Switchboard happen at the ribbon level. The calcic ribbon being the building block of the Switchboard necessitates many macroscopic functions have microscopic foundations. As the first experimenters began to experience with glasswire, they realized that pushing slugs of chalk down it required these slugs to be prepared, or 'packaged' in some manner, so that they could slip unimpeded down the glasswire instead of being torn to pieces by chalk. They began to call these hypothetical chalk slugs '**packets**', for simply representing packets of information.

One of the first realizations was that packets needed to be small, to fit down varying diameters of glasswire with minimal destructive interaction. There needed to be a way to pack what would normally be considerable amounts of information - and thus a large, very physical quantity of ribbon-chalk - down to as small a space as possible, without compromising on the integrity of that information, or accidentally creating hyperweave. 

The first postulated ideas were ways of partially weaving ribbon, to form more dense, but neat packages of ribbon chalk that could fit in the small diameters of the glasswire, but it then became a task of having every device that interfaced with such glasswire needing a means to weave ribbon before pushing it down the glasswire. There were also additional problems of how the dense package of information created complexity, and this would cause the walls of the glasswire to be more inclined towards destroying it.

The final solution was taken from studying, rather curiously, the backbone weaves of the Switchboard's great families. Analysts of the field realized that the backbone weaves that could be identified in individual members of each family contained information common to all of them, but also information that was incredibly simple in composition, often simply having what could be described as numerical quantities assigned to simple descriptive traits.

It was theorized that packets could be constructed similarly; an amount of chalk ribbon wound around a central backbone, and this backbone would contain immensely common, general information, while the ribbon around it would contain specificity, and components on both ends of the glasswire - sender and receiver - would sort and bisect information in this manner when sending, and stitch it back together when being received.

It came to be called the **dictionary brace** at first, due to how much it simplified and expedited the sending of textual information. Later, it was referred to more generally as the **glasswire packet weft brace**, encompassing all forms of ribbon sent down the glasswire. 

> A diagrammatical representation of this is necessary.

This, however, solved the information transfer aspect of the entire affair. The final model of a glasswire packet was series of concentric cylinders. At the core was the weft brace, which served to store the larger, more common information contained in weave. Around that central cylinder was the rest of the packet's information load, this being the stripped and simplified information ribbon, containing the bulk of the more specific information in the packet. The next cylindrical layer after this is a layer of 'dummy' chalk. This acts as fuel and shielding for the movement of the packet through the glasswire, being immensely simple to disincline the walls of the glasswire from devouring it too swiftly.

Facilitating the movement of the package is a measure of chalk-glass at the under or rear of the entire packet assembly, which prompts the destructive propulsion that moves the entire packet down the glasswire. At the top or front of the packet is a complex bit of chalk ritualism known as the **logistical ledger**. This component interfaces with a bit of infrastructure placed by the Third Kin when they came to finally harness the naturally-occurring example of glasswire permeating the Dancirah.

> A diagrammatical representation of this is necessary.

### Spool Storage and Dynamics
Information taking physical form in the Switchboard necessitated a way to store it. This information being primarily ribbon made the means of storing it fairly obvious; physical **spools** around which immense lengths of ribbon are wound. As the information needs to be read, a bit of it is fed through smaller spools that pass ribbon over reader apparatus linked to compute cores - this particular functionality being explained fairly later. 

These spools of ribbon being chalk themselves, however, makes them somewhat vulnerable to various phenomena. A chalkweaver activating their active draw in an environment full of spools can absorb their calcic matter and thus utterly destroy a large data hoard. Other chalk-consuming phenomena make little discrimination between ambient chalk and chalk in spools, and thus it is vary possible for an active ritual - for example - to unwind the contents of a spool and consume it as raw chalk.

For this reason, spools are usually physically insulated, with larger mass-storage spools being stored and their contents fed like a belt over rollers to where they are needed to be read. Spools meant for usage in devices such as slates, or spools that are generally more mobile are instead incased in glass chambers, which insulate them from the outside calcic world, maintaining the integrity of the data within. 

## The DevitNet
The resultant of many processions spent understanding the interactions between chalk and glass, and coming to harness the naturally occurring example of a perfect, stable fusion of the two. 

### The Anarhiza
Many concepts in the Samsara canon stem from a narrative design vision of the Switchboard to contain a litany of wholly natural features that are creatively used by its denizens to their own ends. Much like installing a waterwheel on a river flowing powerfully down a mountain, the Third Kin are envisioned as constantly seeking ways to use their surroundings to their advantage, which plays perfectly in the particularly-strider mantra of exploration; the necessity of finding new 'surroundings' to make use of.

A realization of this is the Anarhiza. Much like the various other horticultural components employed by Striders in their rituals and elsewhere ([[The Voice in Flowers]]), the tree that is the Anarhiza - more properly known as the **Verrphagic Anarhiza** (glass-eating upside-down root) - is unique in it's ability to exist in both the Switchboard and the Vitric Shelf. The tree seemingly originates from the Shelf, as it most peculiarly grows upside down; it's roots stretching skywards into semi-tangible shimmer where it crosses the boundary between the Shelf and the Switchboard - before phasing out of sight and reality totally - while its branches and leaves grow downwards into the Switchboard, soaking up chalk like sunlight. The roots of the anarhiza are said to occupy an intangible 'boundary plane' between the Vitric Shelf and the Dancirah, much like the Challenger Horizon that cordons off the deep from the sky.

Even more curiously, no individual Anarhiza exists, studies on it concluding that every single 'individual' Anarhiza is merely another branch of a far greater progenitor tree to which all Anarhiza are linked through their roots. That, supposedly, every new tree planted grows its roots into the Shelf and meets a collection of roots already present, which it fuses with, becoming another node on that ancient, endless network, seemingly spanning the entire Switchboard.

But the quality of the anarhiza that led to a revolution of the operation of the Switchboard was that its roots were naturally-occurring chalk-glass complexes. Even more absurdly, they were hollow, and thus the roots of the anarhiza were, in fact, natural **glasswire**. Coupled with the fact that the anarhiza was one, singular, plane-spanning organism, it was theorized and then proven that chalk in packet form could be moved from any one point in the 'root network' to any other point in it. The value of this was instantly obvious; a means for high-speed communication across the entire Dancirah.

It came to be called the Dendro-Vitric Network; the **DevitNet**.

### The Dendro-Vitric Network
The Dendro-Vitric Network, or **DevitNet**, refers to a colossal, fragmented, Dancirah-spanning megastructure built upon the ancient anarhiza's network of roots occupying the boundary between the Dancirah and the Vitric Shelf. With every point on the root network being connected to every other point by means of endlessly branching paths, it is possible to send chalk from one point to another on the DevitNet, thereby facilitating high speed communications throughout the entire Switchboard. 

For a device to be able to send and receive chalk - communicate - on the DevitNet, it needs to be fitted with a number of compatibility modifications. Primarily, this is a cutting from the anarhiza, which feed on chalk through their miniscule leaf structures to propagates their roots into the fourth spatial dimension, where the boundary between the the Dancirah and the Vitric Shelf lies. The roots of the anarhiza live within this boundary, however, not traversing it completely to emerge in the Vitric Shelf.

When a device is fitted with a cutting from the anarhiza, a packet as described above can be 'pumped' into its branch structures, where it is taken in easily due to the anarhiza's affinity for both glass and chalk. It passes through its trunk, and then reaches the beginning of the roots of the tree, where it delves into the **Vitric Boundary**. In there, the packet of chalk would normally travel down whatever route the destructive interaction of chalk and glass sees fit to propel it, but the earliest builders of the DevitNet rectified this by using **logistical ledgers**.

Before the anarhiza's roots could be used for the intensely involved infrastructure its imagined use case demanded, various modifications had to be made to the root network first. One such modification was the 'installation' of a **logistical guide lattice** within the Vitric Boundary, this being done by devising 'devices' composed almost entirely of calcic ritualism that could enter the root network, burrow *out* of the anarhiza's roots into the substrate of the Vitric Boundary, and deploy minuscule spherical structures containing a bit of calcic ritualism. When a packet with a logistical ledger built into its physical structure comes near one of these spherical **guideposts**, and the ritualism in the ledger has been appropriately engineered, the two ritual constructs in both will briefly interact, causing a minor deflective force. Placed at junctions, these boundary guideposts ensure packets go exactly where they are sent. 

It is worth discussing some of the implications of the DevitNet being built upon the natural structure of the anarhiza's roots. 

While the Anarhiza does allow communication across the Switchboard, it is more correct to say that it allows communication anywhere the roots of the tree are present. Though the tree occurs naturally - and grows too, expanding to locales where it wasn't previously present - occasionally Striders must go to far-flung areas of the Switchboard to plant new ones to link new settlements or establish relay stations, as well as maintain old trees to avoid parts of the network collapsing. 

The Switchboard's functionally internet-analogue is considerably similar to ours, but for the nontrivial difference that, for the most part, the entirety of the DevitNet is conducted on what can be described as hardline cable. This hardline cable being the anarhiza also means that the entirety of the DevitNet's digital space **is a mirror of the Dancirah's astro-geographical structure**. 

The DevitNet is thus divided along lines similar to that of the Dancirah's, with cradles existing in the DevitNet that house collections of users. One of the consequences of this is that breaks in the hardline cabling that is the glasswire can leave the corresponding astro-geographical locale isolated from the rest of the DevitNet, and thus the Switchboard, and cabling that needs to break for this to happen are usually fairly easy to locate through following the physical branch cables until they converge into large central arteries moving titanic amounts of information. 

Thus, maintenance of the DevitNet is a tireless, unending task, undertaken by coalition forces, primarily Sil'khan and Lancasters - especially when considering the sabotage of DevitNet infrastructure is a common tactic of Vault Minds and unscrupulous parties.

One this note, we can look more into the infrastructure of the DevitNet.

### Netfrastructure
The infrastructure of the DevitNet is a matter of subdivisions. Colossal things serve a number of large things, which serve a number of medium-sized things, which serve a number of small things, which *yet* serve a number of *yet smaller* things. In this manner, the DevitNet is very hierarchical, both reflected and created by its infrastructure.

Perhaps the largest single element of netfrastructure, though not in the manner one initially assumes, are the various Interdictory Vaults in the Switchboard that are the domains of the Interdiction Minds that survived the Second Praxis conflict and the Mind Hunts, so many processions ago. The Minds tapped into, and learned to harness the anarhiza network long before the Third Kin did, and in fact still use it today, though they do so primarily on isolated or 'gated' networks that are deliberately disconnected from the larger anarhiza network. While the Interdictory Vaults don't exactly let the Third Kin use their glasswire to move their own information, the fact that the Vaults and the Minds within operate on even isolated sections of the DevitNet is important for reasons stated later.

With that being said, the then largest piece of netfrastructure operated by the Third Kin are simply called **nexuses**. These nexuses contain by way of operation, considerably large anarhiza trees, and multiple of them too. The root-glasswire emanating from them is particularly large, allowing colossal information throughput. These nexuses are often as large as starships, and are marked as major points of interest in starmaps and wedge ledgers. Most are entire operating platforms built deep in the Starwylds, doubling as outposts for nomads and positions for various organizations and coalitions to establish a presence. When particularly large information transfers need to be made, it is generally encouraged to do so at nexuses, to avoid clogging up smaller glasswire with their reduced throughput. 

Following nexuses are the unceremoniously named **sub-nexuses**, and following them, **cradle nexuses**, which usually serve an individual cradle in a sector of the Sky, this being any number of regions, wellsprings, sky installments and many other less permanent installations such as passing jump and starships. **Orbital Net Relays** usually orbit a region, and feed glasswire from cradle nexuses down to the region's various settlements below. These **ground-based net relays** are an umbrella term for a vast collection of centralized netfrastructure that shrink further as they finally reach the end user and netizen in the Dancirah. Those who can afford to establish them usually have personal ground-stations for linking into the DevitNet, though these are generally to be found in region-side cities and arcologies and in use by large organizations such as the Spyndl Academy's many branches and outposts.

Connecting the various divisions of nexuses are differing classes of glasswire, varying by size and thus, information throughput. One of the major constraints of the DevitNet is that it isn't possible to 'widen' or generally replace existing anarhiza roots, due to the relative impossibility of macroscopic operations within the Vitric Boundary. Planting entirely new anarhiza is necessary to increase the **net throughput** to a locale of the Switchboard.

Some smaller sub-netfrastructure exists, this being an umbrella term for various Net-enabled components such as Net Buoys that exist. In particular, there is the **microlNet**.

### The microlNet and Isolated Networks
It is possible to set up secondary and isolated networks - **isolNets** - under the main anarhiza root network, to serve various functions. This is a particularly involved process, as a major point in the existing DevitNet's favor is exactly that - the fact it already exists. Setting up **gated networks** requires planting large amounts of anarhiza over huge swathes of inter-regional space, and can only really be achieved on small scale for private usage, on relative large scale by very coordinated, very large organizations and coalitions, or '**straitNets**' that describe gated networks that link two points, or a small number of them.

Perhaps the most successful example of the development and deployment of a secondary, isolated network is the **microlNet**, a high-speed, low throughput network that operates under immensely stiff regulation, presided over by net authorities and the Spyndl Academy. It runs alongside most of the major starship and striding routes in the Switchboard, and serves primarily the purposes of critical information relay, and being an isolated purpose-built network for handling emergencies. Downed starships, Striders who have fallen into the Void, the sudden appearance of an Interdictory Mind's swarm of chromelings, a flux storm or stellar procession beginning out of season, and a large list of many other esoteric yet plausible occurrences - the microlNet exists to ensure critical communications are never obstructed by having to take the main paths on the DevitNet. For this reason, its infrastructure is both incredibly hidden and immensely well-guarded, ensuring that none can sabotage it.

Interdictory Minds also operate their own isolNets, used primarily for issuing commands to their chromeling armies within and outside the Vaults, and communicating with other Interdictory Minds, to share information such as profiles on active Kache-Krashing teams - elaborated upon further. Breaching these nets is a common practice of Striders, in operations described further down. Emergent Vault Minds aren't particularly well-versed in the affairs of the Vaults, and as such usually lack isolated nets and chromeling defense mechanisms, usually having other quirks of their own to make up for it.

The physical substrate-space in the Vitric Boundary that separates isolNets has come to be called the **Glasswall**, and this term has been used to describe the act of isolating networks or things and concepts in general. 'Breaching the Glasswall' and uniting isolated nets with other nets and even the main DevitNet, is something explored further down. 

Many major organizations operate their own isolated nets, for internal sharing of information within the physical structure of an organization, and straitNets that link outpost to outpost. This brings us to discussing the various authoritative powers that control the DevitNet to varying extents.

## Switchboard Computation
In which we delve into understanding the various devices in the Switchboard that link up to and across the various nets, these being the Switchboard's computers. They are similar to traditional, existing computers in macroscopic function, but their microscopic fundamentals differ considerably, in that Switchboard computers harness the collective intelligence of lower beings to both compute, and perform functions that allow them to interface with local, calcic reality. 

> And a foreword; the original design of Switchboard compute suffered from being a draft and not knowing it. The macroscopic derivative mechanics were defined (Slates, the Breach Protocol) but the microscopic foundations from which they were defined were never properly built themselves. It has happened before, and stems primarily from not doing sufficient enough inquiry into fundamentals in that regard. With this proposal, it's being rectified.
> 
> In addition to that is how Switchboard compute actually works. With the elimination of such useful things as the atom and electromagnetism, it became fairly indefensible to have computation built off of these things. As such, it became necessary to devise novel foundations to build compute off of. To do this, I went one rung up the ladder from the absolute, baseline fundamental, and chose to harness existing Switchboard phenomena in creative and in-canon-acceptable ways, giving us the new grand theorem of compute, and how it functions in the Switchboard.

### Computational Core Architecture
On the hearts of all compute in the Switchboard. 
#### Origins
Critical to all computers in the Switchboard is the **calcic computational core**, colloquially known as the '**cube**' (3C). However, it is not a Third Kin invention, and was rather discovered by the Third Kin during their conflicts with the First Thinkers. Destruction of the Mind-manufactured chromelings yielded the curious technology within them, and when the Third Thinkers began plundering the vaults of their contents - this being the Vermeil civilization - the conclusion was made that this technology had existed for a while, either created by the First Thinkers, or taken and perfected by the Second. Either way, the usefulness of this technology could not be scoffed at, once the Third Kin understood what it did and how it functioned.

To pursue the ends of understanding computation and these devices, the **Vermeilion Compute Society**, was formed under the already existing Vermeilion Interdiction Research Foundation, a division of the Spyndl Academy.

> Relevant reading: [[The Dawn of the Dancirah]].

The computational cores used by the chromelings and manufactured by the First Thinkers were, in fact, powered by the First Thinkers. By encasing a lesser First Thinker in the elaborate physical control structure created by the Minds, it was possible to use their non-trivial thinking capacity as secondary to ones own, by means of subjugating the will of the Mind within the control box. The crucibles and the mechanics of spontaneous calcic evolution continually created fairly weak calcic fauna resembling the First Thinkers, and harnessing them in large quantities allowed for the creation of calcic brains that could be instructed to solve problems or act in certain manners; a rather curious form of 'living' artificial intelligence.

The Third Kin, however, didn't have the ability to simply create First Thinker Minds. While they could and did plunder the technology of the chromelings and use it to create the first generation of Kin-built computational apparatus, it suffered from various flaws, chief amongst them being their lack of understanding of it, and thus an inability to modify it, repair it or upgrade it.

That changed, however, when researchers at the time discovered the [[The EPIT#The Mindspun|mindspun]]. Believed to have emerged alongside the Third Kin at their own grand astrolabic resolution, they resembled the First Thinker Minds in form and - to a lesser extent - function, but suffered from a greatly impaired will. The mindspun simply ambled through the Dancirah, demonstrating intelligence yes, but more so exhibiting a barely contained, radiant wrath at seemingly everything. They posed something of a threat to the Third Kin due to their ability to 'take over' calcic objects, granting them elementary sentience, and their ability to emerge from seemingly nothing (as the mechanics of [[On Birthing and Being#Emergent Minds|emergent minds]] were unknown at the time).

Their final interesting quality, what differed them from the First Thinkers, what made them particularly a threat to the Third Kin, and what allowed for developing a new generation of Switchboard compute, was their ability to interact with and even emulate - to an extent - the Five Straits.

When combined with the fact the Mindspun - lacking in wills of their own - can thus have their will bent by greater calcic intelligences, it was theorized that it was possible to create a device that packed mindspun into a space, fed them with external will and instruction, and thus compelled them to act in certain manners. The creation of the first prototype for what would later become all cubes - the **compute foundation one**, brought this theory to physical fruition.

#### Mechanics 
Compute cubes consist of two primary devices; a **containment chamber** for mindspun, and a device known as the **instruction set**. The instruction set is a device created by the Vermeilion Compute Society (VCS) that contains a ledger of basic instructions understandable by mindspun, coupled with a bit of calcic ritualism that channels the praxis of the entire VCS, as an organization that subjugates the mindspun, and thus allows for bending their function to the VCS' will, and by proxy, the will of all Third Kin. This instruction set is the baseline for nearly all comoute devices in the Switchboard, and the VCS has dubbed their constantly iterated-upon bit of ware the **Subsystems Command Matrix**. The VCS-SCM - as it has come to be called - is discussed further later on.

The mindspun's desire for a vessel makes the containment chamber particularly effective for containing them, and by packing more and more of them in a space, it is possible to compel them to cooperate and thus vastly increase the computational capacity of a given cube. However, when mindspun are used in this manner, individual differences otherwise imperceptible bubble to the service, and it led to a science on the so-called '**speciation of mindspun**', creating a body of knowledge on what kind of mindspun are useful for computational ends, and the application of this in creating compute cubes for different types of device.

### Harnessing the Mindspun and APS Quotients
The usage of mindspun in compute cubes harnesses the mindspun's ability to both think and cooperate, even at an elementary level. As more and more mindspun are set towards a goal, they become exponentially more capable at working towards it. When the mindspun are used in this manner however, individual differences emerge to the fore, which have tangible effects on the usefulness of certain mindspun in collections of mindspun, and the usefulness of collections of mindspun in different kinds of compute cores and towards different ends.

This body of knowledge came to be called the **Speciation of the Mindspun**, and was among the first considerable inquiries into the nature of the mindspun, and it was no coincidence that the military atmosphere of the time drove it. The realization of the speciation of the mindspun came in the form of the work on **APS Quotients**.

#### APS Scores and Quotients
**APS** refers to a three-fold numerical measure and expression of a mindspun's individual nature, and thus how suitable it would be for usage in a compute cube, as well as how suited it would be to usage in certain ends. The **APS Score** of a mindspun is determined by a number of alpha and beta level factors that act as base values and modifiers of those base values. Through a series of tests and analyses of a mindspun's Five Straits, it is possible to obtain numerical values for the following quantities that make up the APS designation; 

- **Accuracy**: Refers to the mindspun's ability to perform complex tasks and yield accurate results.
- **Speed**: Refers to the mindspun's ability to perform long tasks and yield fast results.
- **Potency**: Refers to the mindspun's ability to perform actions in-line with the calcic, and is essential for determining which compute devices are capable of **mockweaving.**

The **APS Quotient** is a representation of how much better an individual mindspun is versus the average of all measured APS values of mindspun that have passed through the labs of the Vermeilion Compute Society. This allows for the creation of a dynamic grading system for the quality of individual mindspun, as well as allow for monitoring the quality of mindspun in the wild and produced in ideal environments, significant changes in this possibly being indicative of inquiry-worthy changes in the wider Dancirah.

Determining the A, P and S values of a mindspun is a product of their beta-level baseline values, and their alpha-level overall modifiers. The result of this is placing numerical quantifiers on mindspun's individual capabilities, and thus how well they'd fit into different applications of compute cubes.

Thus, we can look at the components of the APS Quotients, roughly divided into a number of categories. As the various qualities that modify the APS scores of a mindspun are a product of differences in a mindspun's straits, qualities are accordingly called 'sub-' followed by the strait they are reliant on.

##### Alpha-Level Sub-Strait Overall Modifiers
A number of top-level modifiers that serve as overall modifiers to the mindspun's final score.

**A - Accuracy - Score Modifiers**
- **Accuracy Sub-Compute Strait**
	A global modifier for the 'A' value, accuracy; a product of the computational strait that subjects chalk to transformative equations. It refers to **the computational strait's frequency of yielding results within acceptable margin of error**.
- **Accuracy Sub-Interpreter Strait**
	A global modifier for the 'A' value, accuracy; a product of the interpreter strait that takes in chalk and separates woven chalk from plain, fresh chalk. It refers to **the interpreter strait's ability to maximally remove woven chalk from the calcic intake, which would otherwise cause disruption and introduce external inaccuracies to the mindspun's compute**.

**P - Potency - Score Modifiers**
- **Potency Sub-Interface Strait**
	A global modifier for the 'P' value, potency; a product of the interface strait that communicates with the other straits and the local environment. It refers to **how well the mindspun can dump the results of complex calcic computation into the local environment, necessary for *mockweaving***.

**S - Speed - Score Modifiers**
- **Speed Sub-Compute Strait**
	A global modifier for the 'S' value, speed; a product of the computational strait that subjects chalk to transformative equations. It refers to **the computational strait's speed of operation and yielding results**.
- **Speed Sub-Interface Strait**
	 A global modifier for the 'S' value, speed; a product of the interface straits that communicates with the other straits and the local environment. It refers to the **overall throughput of the interface strait, how quickly it can communicate with the other straits and with other mindspun**.
- **Speed Sub-Potential Strait**
	A global modifier for the 'S' value, speed; a product of the potential strait that stores unharnessed chalk for use. It refers to **a mindspun's ability to store chalk for ready use, in a manner similar to cache in real-world computation**.
- **Speed Sub-Interpreter Strait**
	A global modifier for the 'S' value, speed; a product of the interpreter strait that takes in chalk and separates woven chalk from plain, fresh chalk. It refers to **the speed at which the interpreter strait performs this function**. 

**Wildcards - Esoteric Modifiers**
- **Coefficient of Collaboration**
	A wildcard modifier that determines the base value of a mindspun's ability to collaborate effectively with other mindspun within a compute cube. This is in reality two values, as mindspun stack their collaborative benefits both partially additively (more common) and partially multiplicatively (more rare).
- **Adversity Compute Proficiency Value**
	A separate modifier that determines how proficient a mindspun is at computing calcic equations in Teks and ritualism, especially towards combative ends. This is a very necessary value for compute cubes that will work in **mockweaving** applications.
- **Interference Resistance**
	A measure of the mindspun's ability to resist external calcic interference that bypasses shielding, and the ability to self-correct for inaccuracies, speed deficits and potency reductions introduced as a result of this interference. This value is very important for compute cores that will be operating in extreme calcic environments. 
- **Coefficient of Growth**
	A measure of the mindspun's ability to grow, which manifests as gradual inclines in its various other measures and overall APS quotient. Mindspun gradually grow as they perform computation and are subjected to various environments.

##### Beta-Level Computational Strait Baseline Values
These individual qualities listed below differ from mindspun to mindspun, but all modify the functionality and thus capabilities of the computational strait, thus determining - at an elementary level - their base viability in a compute cube. Additionally, they determine the **unmodified** APS score of a mindspun, which is further, finally modified by the alpha level modifiers.

- **Multivariate**
	**A, S**
	A measure of the mindspun's ability to compute multivariate data and perform computations using complex equations. This empowers mindspun to calculate data from contexts such as economics and marketing, healthcare, the environment and climate, social science research, and complex calcic ritualism.
- **Biscuit**
	**A, S**
	 A measure of the mindspun's ability to work with large volumes of data.
- **Crumb**
	**A, S**
	A measure of the mindspun's ability to work with small volumes of data.
- **Numeracy and Literacy**
	**A, S**
	A measure of a mindspun's grasp of numbers themselves and language. This is particularly important, as some mindspun readily grab some Danciran languages over others, while some struggle with more complex numerical forms and manipulations, such as negative numbers, imaginary numbers, decimals, computing square roots, vectors, the like. 
- **Iteration**
	**A**
	If a mindspun yields a result that it isn't within the acceptable margin of error, it can perform the computation again by iterating upon it to get closer to a more accurate answer. This determines how effective the iteration process is; how much close it gets to a more accurate answer with each cycle. The iterative process compromises speed, however.
- **Breach**
	**A, P, S**
	The proficiency of a mindspun at executing offensive calcic compute measures, such as the repertoire of tools that make up the **Breach Protocol**. This metric is essential for compute cores that will be used in devices built for Kache-Krashing operations.
- **Extrapolation**
	**S**
	When provided with, under some considerations, insufficient data for making decisions, mindspun are able to estimate and extrapolate instead of waiting for additional data to reach more solid conclusions. It is possible for mindspun to use only part of an information stream of chalk to begin computation, granting a speed boost in exchange for accuracy. 
- **Expedition**
	**S**
	Mindspun, when instructed, can drop points of accuracy in a given data value to compute faster. Dropping decimal places can allow for less accurate values, but faster compute times in moments where this is needed.
- **Pattern**
	**A, P, S**
	The measure of the mindspun's ability to compute patterns, especially the patterns that are transmitted via packets over glasswire. Minimizing losses in calcic integrity when stripping and replacing the backbone and interacting with storage spool is essential for even generalist computing.
- **Packaging**
	**A, S**
	A measure of the ability for mindspun to prepare glasswire-compatible packets by compressing weave and simplifying it in line with the dictionary brace used by packets. Mindspun need to be able to analyze data and know what to place in the dictionary brace to even make transfer along the glasswire possible, much less doing so quickly and maintaining the integrity of the data. The ability to add additional structural components such as
- **4D-Spatial**
	**A, S**
	The mindspun's ability to compute the fourth-dimensional spatial values that are typical of the Void. Computation that deals with logistics involving the Void require mindspun capable of computing the additional mathematics created by this context.  
- **Praxis**
	**A, P, S**
	Some mindspun are 'touched' - perhaps - with the ability to compute the esoteric mechanics of the Praxis Protocol and the mechanics of the Astrolabe's ledgers. Should the rare occurrence when computing the mechanics of praxis arise, mindspun specifically gifted in this regard are required, and none else.

#### Compute Cube Fabrication
A demand for compute devices translates into a demand for compute cubes, which in turn produces a demand for mindspun. While mindspun do occur in the wild, and there are even tangible advantages to using wild-formed mindspun over those produced in artificial conditions, it doesn't change the fact that much of the mindspun used in mass-produced compute cores are a result of synthesis. 

Fortunately, the mechanics and nature of the Astrolabe sees to it that things, even intelligences, are always spawning into being, even more so in crafted, ideal conditions. Being emergent minds, they tend to arise wherever minds are already present - intelligence spawns intelligence - and as such simply having Kin present in an environment is enough to begin production of mindspun.

What is far more commonly done is that First Thinker Minds are either acquired or synthesized, and then subjected to calcic tinkering that rapidly accelerates their thinking faculties, at the expense of their calcic stability and general longevity. Giving an 'overclocked' Mind a vast array of date to compute burns it out relatively quickly, but spawns and leaves behind plentiful mindspun in its wake - spun from the mind, as it were.

### Slates and Switchboard Computation
The mechanics and general canon established above allows us to delve into the actualization of theorem; the utilization of principles to realize physical form. Many different kinds of computers are built and exist in the Switchboard, differing in form, function and even in underlying mechanics, but no single computational device in all of the Switchboard's canon has earned the repute that the **Slate** has. 

Being a tool crafted by a Skydancer themselves, it began its days in the Dancirah as a tool wielded by a divine entity. From there, it descended into the hands of the Danseers and then all Third Kin, becoming the sidekick of many who stride the vast stars of the Dancirah.

#### The Slate
> This one I have cherished.

The Slate is a creation of the Third Kin, designed to find existing paths and forge new ones. With its power of grand computation and interfacing with local calcic reality, it serves as an interpreter between a wielder and the wider world. It solidified itself as a sidekick of all Kin alike, in functioning in the depths of the Switchboard. It facilitates the speaking of the calcic tongue in new ways, and serves - ultimately- to grant even greater power to the Third Kin, covering for their weaknesses and expanding upon their strengths. It is a digital multitool, engineered to be an unparalleled sidearm for living, surviving and thriving within the Switchboard.

**Scope**
- Origins and History of Slates (Dancirah's Dawn)
- Construction (Const. parts)
- Functionality
- (Allusion to) the Breach Protocol

##### Origins
![[The Dawn of the Dancirah#^96990c]]

The first Slates were created as a matter of experimentation tinged by necessity. The discovery of the anarhiza root network and the presence of the First Thinker Minds on them told the Third Kin of the time that they too needed a means to invade, fight and seize control of this utterly unknown and unprecedented frontier. The piles of research and knowledge accumulated from studying the Minds, the mindspun, the anarhiza and the network it created, the long-distance communication the Minds were capable off because of it, and the reverse-engineering of chromeling's internal workings and technology served as the foundation for all that would later become the theorems of communication and compute, all this spearheaded by the **Vermeilion Compute Society**, a subdivision of the **Vermeilion Interdiction Research Foundation**.

From these bodies of knowledge, the first Kin-built computers emerged, and when it was thought to integrate them more closely with calcic subject matter, the **Slate** emerged, realized into physicality by Skydancer Onuris, the Hammer.

Because of the context in which Slates emerged - the ongoing Praxis Conflicts with the First Thinker Minds - the Slate was primarily a weapon. With them, they could tap into the isolated networks (isolNets) that the Minds used to communicate across the vast Dancirah, gaining an edge over them in information warfare. In particular, Slates facilitated **breach operations**, which allowed the Third Kin to gain unauthorized access into the Mind's Vaults by piercing the **Glasswall**, the Mind-engineered insulating layer in the Vitric Boundary that shields the Mind's command and control networks from the larger 'proto' DevitNet that existed at the time. Breaching this wall allowed the Third Kin to disable the Vault's shields, curtail their defenses, and secure entry, in grand operations known as **Kache Krashing**. Slates further aided in contending with the Minds themselves, and the defenses of the Vaults once inside. 

These breach operations were made possible by what later came to be known as the **Breach Protocol**, though this is discussed later.

With the conclusion of the more overt of the praxis conflicts and the eventual demilitarization of the Third Kin, Slates moved from being primarily a weapon to a tool, still outfitted with a litany of capabilities that granted it offensive prowess, but also found its way into the hands of those who could generally benefit from powerful and portable computing, in applications such as navigation, industry and calcic ritualism. They gained civilian applications as well, serving as entertainment devices, or as tools in industries.

##### Construction - Physical Design
A Slate is made up of a number of constituent parts. These are necessary for a baseline Slate, with ample avenues existing for the installation of periphery, that modify its function in various ways. For the baseline, we have;

- A slab of crystalline chalk
- A VCS doctrine-assembled computational core (cube)
- A high-capacity blank ribbon spool
- A cutting from the verrphagic anarhiza

**The Baseplate**
All Slates begin first as a hewn slab of crystalline chalk. To interface with local calcic reality, this large slab of chalk acts as a singular large potential strait for the entire Slate assembly. All other components will be inset into this chalk backboard, in slots cut for them by precise machine tooling. Beyond a mere baseplate, however, the constituent chalk of the slab itself can have subtle or even overt effects on the final Slate it creates, ranging from a general boost in its computational capabilities to granting wholly new powers. 

The culture around Slates has led to many nomads of the Dancirah and denizens in general seek out and source the backplate of their Slates for themselves. The most common source of Slate baseplates are wellsprings, with Slate builders hewing and shaping crystalline chalk with simple hand tools. The general floor for Slates that will see use across the Dancirah for computational, calcic weft and combative function typically possess baseplates built from chalk hewn from deep inside a wellspring, the chalk within having been a party to more of the Switchboard's existence, and has thus matured and grown stronger with time.

Some Slates don't use chalk, however, but rather crystalline alloys of other materials. Crystal amaranthite baseplates Slates are some of the only Slates capable of maintaining optimal operating status upon crossing the Challenger Horizon, enabling functionality in the Challenger Dark. Slates built from [[Switchboard Technology#Tiered Materials Metals and Alloys|hexic kacherock]] are granted them enhanced capabilities in breach-related functions, elaborated upon later.

**The Compute Cube**
With slots cut out for the following components, we can then proceed to the brains of the entire assembly, the compute cube. Manufactured primarily by various parties using VCS-developed or based schematics, the cube houses the mindspun and the VCS's doctrinal instruction set, the Subsystems Command Matrix. Additionally, many parties choose to overlay the VCS's SCM with their own in-house bespoke instruction sets or command matrices, built to draw function - on a praxis level - from a relevant doctrine, as well as bestow additional functions written in by the party in question.

The functions of Slates also demand certain kinds of mindspun, regarding their overall APS scores as well as proficiencies in certain spheres. Slates that will be used for navigation, for example, benefit considerably from cubes with high A scores. Slates that will be used to operate **Weftloaders** and perform **breach functions** benefit from high P scores, as these functions depend particularly on raw calcic output. Slates that are integrated into the local lattice of a wielder benefit from high S - speed - scores, especially if these Slates control frequently updating mechanisms such as chromegrafts. 

Slates that will be used in the Void, in addition to almost certainly needing a crystalline amaranthite backboard, also benefit from cubes possessing mindspun with high scores in 4D-Spatial compute. Cubes used in Slates built for breach functions additionally benefit from this quality in mindspun; a predisposition to breach methodologies. High Expedition score cores are useful for controlling chromegrafts, as they have the passive benefit of built in human-like clumsiness (which is surprisingly desired by many) while also gaining buffs to computation speed of the operations for controlling those chromegrafts. 

The alpha-level modifiers - especially the wildcards - vastly shape cube functionality, with the Coefficient of Growth allowing Slates to grow better as they are used, and the Adversity Compute Proficiency measure being essential for cubes that will be used in **Weftloaders** and in calcic combat. High Interference Resistance doubles in usefulness in both combat and extreme environments, such as near law stars, in certain biomes on regions, or in the depths of the Void.

Combinations of mindspun yield cores with various proficiencies, which in turn results in Slates built for varying functions. As a note, there is a relatively large scene of individual-built compute cores, manufactured by those who need cubes shaped with laser-focused purposes in mind. Many particularly skilled nomads of the Dancirah eventually build their own compute cores for their Slates, optimized for the way they use them.

**The Ribbon Spool**
A blank spool serves as the memory strait of the Slate. Inset into the chalk baseplate and then shielded by a chamber of glass, it is shielded from external calcic interference that could compromise the integrity of the information within. Calcic storage is incredibly dense per unit of space, which encourages information hoarding, but also increases the catastrophe that is instances of information corruption. 

Information is stored in **braced-weft** form, making it readable by mindspun within the compute cube, and transferrable over glasswire. This form of storage also allows for the unfolding of larger weave - such as large objects - unfolding them into ribbon, storing them in the Slate, and refolding them elsewhere when needed, serving as a fairly effective way of moving things around the Switchboard. However, storing things in this manner occupies considerable space on the spool, and contributes to the overall **information mass** of the Slate, which is of major concern to Striders. Additionally, the equation for refolding must be known to the mindspun within the Slate or the wielder to enable refolding the ribbon of the unfolded object.

**The Anarhiza**
Integrating a cutting of the verrphagic anarhiza, an esoteric plant native to both the Dancirah and the Vitric Shelf, acts as a form of interface strait for the Slate assembly, and allows the Slate to make use of various forms of glasswire infrastructure, allowing communication over the DevitNet, microlNet, and various isolNets and straitNets as is applicable. It is also essential for staging breach operations, as breach methods are deployed over glasswire, thus mandating a Slate capable of interfacing with it.

Typically it sits in a cylindrical recess cut into the baseplate for it, and linked to the compute core by chalk straits. Information to be sent over glasswire is packaged into braced-weft packets by the compute cube and sent to the branch cutting, which sends it down its stalk that straddles the Vitric Boundary just out of sight and reach. There, it makes use of the various DevitNet apparatus to traverse the root network and reach its destination. 

There is a small quirk of communications with anarhiza cuttings in the Switchboard, however; greater information throughput is available to devices that are currently stationary. When an anarhiza cutting is moved, it is momentarily, partially severed from the rest of the network, leaving the branch cutting connected to the root by a stalk-like thread. When stationary, the anarhiza is rapidly fed chalk that grows and widens the stalk, and thus its ability to physically accommodate larger information packets. For this reason, Slates moving at high speeds - such as in the pack of a Strider - can really only interface with immensely low-throughput glasswire such as the microlNet, and to do any larger scale data transfer, movement must be slowed or paused to allow the anarhiza cutting to make a solid connection to the rest of the root network.

##### Construction - Philosophy
Slates are the perfected manifestation of the cassette-futurism design philosophy embodied by the Switchboard's technology. They are built with portability and durability in mind, taking on an industrial, almost militaristic silhouette. Ease of repair, tactility, modularity - these things are essentials of a Slate's design. As such, Slates appear somewhat dated, seemingly a generation or so behind the touchscreen, ultra-slim, voice-activated design paradigms of today. Thick glass, hard plastic, polymers and metals, big, repairable parts; Slates are designed with the knowledge that they'll take a beating and the intention that they survive it.

Beginning with it's chalk-slab backing, in size it can reach that of a decently-sized cutting board, close to an inch thick in its thinnest sections, though this is somewhat skewed by the Slate's intended usecase and the whims of the wielder, assuming they are also its builder. Much of the internal workings, due to having been inset in the chalk baseplate, are thus hidden from view. 

Much of the variation in shape and appearance of a Slate comes in the peripherals installed to complete its construction and make able to be used. Most - at minimum - are outfitted with a keyboard, display, and tracker controller such as a nib, small ball or full-sized touchpad. Ports take high priority as means to interface with other devices and chalk constructs, often done by running chalk ribbon between it and the subject. These connectivity ribbons enable communication between the compute cube within the Slate and other devices or phenomena in the Switchboard, and thus grants the Slate amount of versatility in what it can interface with. It's very common - for example - for Striders to fly their personal jumpships by hooking up their Slates to them, which serves as the ship's computer.

Additional components are varied and up to individual Striders. Many Striders outfit theirs with a full suite of navigational tools (those listed under [[The Strider Protocol#Wayfinding Across the Dancirah|wayfinding apparatus]]) and have the whole process of calculating Stride routes handled by the Slate. Chalk ritualists outfit theirs for deeper ritual analysis. Combat-oriented wielders simulate the powers of their relics and Teks and use those simulations to determine the damage done to a lattice, and how better to maximize it, often installing hard-light projectors on their Slate to project human-sized targets to practice on. The portable and modular design philosophy intrinsic to Slates facilitates all this and more, and further leans into the the Slate's intended purpose as an unrivalled multitool, sidearm, and problem-solver.

As a brief tangent regarding the portability of Slates, it's also worth noting how Slates are carried. Being portable by design, they are almost always worn on the person, facilitated by belts that allow it to be slung over the shoulder, or kept in a holster at the back or side of the body, or mounted in a quick-release system - such as held in place by a magnetic analogue. 

> Depthstriders with their power from the Void typically store their Slates in a pocket void and retrieved whenever needed. Chalkstriders are not so lucky; attempting to do similar would require unfolding a Slate down to ribbon chalk, but the sheer complexity of a Slate means that the equation for folding a Slate back together is so complex as to effectively require the computational power of another slate.

Some radically alter the design and form factor of their Slate to better suit their purposes. Many who use their Slates for combat typically split it into separate modules; relocating the display modules into somewhere more practical, such as a wrist display mounted by straps or a holster, or a HUD display mounted in eye-ware over one or both eyes. The core compute components are similarly distributed, the anarhiza meant for communications mounted into a helmet, and the baseplate kept at the back, along with the compute cube and other periphery.

And perhaps in a display of one of the many philosophies - the lattice as a canvas, in particular - of the Switchboard, some choose to have the components of the Slate mounted directly on to their local lattice, their entire calcic form becoming the Slate's chalk baseplate. Mounting the components sub-dermally and linking them directly to the wielder's straits grants - in a sense - a second set of Five Straits, that results in the wielder gaining entirely new dimensions of performance. The wielders own computational straits further aided by the compute cube grants for much faster, much more accurate thinking, and the connectivity speeds granted by nearly eliminating the physical distance between components allows for supreme conduction of the will. This level of chromegrafting yields Kin that have gone beyond traditional measure, and while the payoff is considerable, there are consequences - as with everything - in the form of new weaknesses, new complexities, and the very unexplored sphere that is having other minds that close to one's own.

#### Function
Discussing the Slate's function is best taken from the angle of its most extreme users; the Dancirah's most prolific nomads, the Strider. The Slate serves as a Strider's sidearm on their jaunts across the Switchboard. A Strider will typically carry a relic-weapon, wield a Tek, know rituals and posses some additional powers granted by knowledge or other implements on their person. The Slate seeks to complete this - rounding out the Strider's kit - by functioning as a tool with unmatched utility. 

At its most mundane, a Slate is a computer and computers solve problems. Communication, information storage, retrieval and processing, productivity tasks and even entertainment, it helps to think of the Slate as occupying the intersection of a smartphone, laptop, supercomputer and purpose-built computers (such as the guidance computer for a smart missile system). Serving an array of purposes, the Slate is designed to be a digital Swiss-army knife; a tackler of tasks of immense shape and size. 

The Slate's true power stems from the intersecting functions of the mindspun-based computational core, and the calcic baseplate. The Slate gains the power to reach out into local calcic reality with a sort of 'pseudo' Five Straits, allowing it to interface with other compute devices and wholly calcic phenomena.

At its most elementary, for example, it can analyze a set of figures given by [[The Strider Protocol#Wayfinding Across the Dancirah|wayfinding measuring equipment]] and from it, produce a viable Striding path from any two given locations in the Switchboard. Taken further, it is capable of '**deep-weave analysis**', allowing it to scan and produce information about nearly *anything* in the Switchboard - regions, relics, Teks, rituals, ongoing Structural Casts and equations, other Striders - anything. It serves as an artificial upgrade to a user's [[The Hands as Chalk#Weavesight|Weavesight]]. It can run the complex calculations a Strider may need in their chalk-weaving, and simulate fold operations to anticipate the result. It can interface with chalk rituals, serving as the interpreter for ongoing loop rituals as well as provide insight on modification and development of countermeasures, working alongside databases of information on the subject. 

The power of the Slate lies in bridging the user and the wider world. It can create certainty where it was previously thought impossible. It can wrench patterns from arcane engines and charts from amorphous clouds of principles. It pulls hard numbers and gives exact information, plumbed from the murky depths of chalk complexities. While plenty of its functions can be handled by a Strider working mentally, the Slate is capable of doing that mental heavy-lifting so a Strider is free to do other things. It reduces the 'grunt-work' of appeasing chalk's more strenuous demands for more complex use, allowing the Strider to focus on how to use the power that this appeasement grants. 

#### Tentative: FRONTIER-SCM
> Tentative, in that I could still come back to use it later, after undergoing revision to bring it in line with the newest canon.

The FRONTIER Subsystems Command Matrix is the software backbone of the Slate's computational core, designed, maintained and improved upon by the Academy. It is the spearhead of the Slate's ability to bridge Chalk and the digital. Originally, it was a software meant solely for navigation and cartography; coordinating apparatus and running calculations with variables obtained from measuring instruments - but it expanded to become a formidable software multitool capable of innumerable calcic and digital functions, particularly so when the utility of Slates in the fight against the Minds became apparent.

**The Acronym**
Taking the first letter of the various functions served by the SCM gives 'FRONTIER', as shown below;

F - Fieldwork
R - Recording
O - Observation
N - Navigation
T - Triangulation
I - Intelligence
E - Establishment
R - Referencing

	There is definitely some fluidity here on what the actual words are. Consult notebook at later date.

### Weftloaders
The gap between those who can weave chalk and those not born so blessed is a gap established at the very moment of the rise of the Third Kin from the inert, but ripe seeding grounds of the astrolabic regions. This gap has only grown with time, as the totality of the knowledge on chalk and how to weave it continues to grow. This gap is of concern to many, as it presents a tangible discrepancy in might between various actors in the Switchboard, and it is thus a common conclusion that those who cannot weave chalk have no real recourse against a chalkweaving opponent.

Further advancements in the development and use of Slates, however, led to a realization of the nature of their make up; in a sense, a Slate can be viewed as a 'false' manifestation of the Five Straits intrinsic to calcic beings, particularly the Third Kin. With components on the Slate serving functions as straits; 

- Calcic baseplate - Potential & Interpreter
- Compute Cube - Computational
- Ribbon Spool - Memory
- Periphery and Ports - Interface

the mechanics of praxis almost arise to fill in the conceptual gap between the true Five Straits and the mocking straits made by the Slate. In this manner, pioneers in this manner of thinking set about developing a form of chalkweaving they called **mockweaving**; chalkweaving that was performed with secondary apparatus, rather than the primary straits that would otherwise have been intrinsic to the wielder. In this manner, it became essential to develop both purpose-built Slates and additional hardware and Slate periphery to facilitate this. 

Many bodies set to work bringing this theory to fruition, but it was Lancaster Innovations - perhaps acting for the betterment of all Lancaster kind - that prototyped and perfected the first **Weftloaders**; a series of devices that allowed nearly any Third Kin to take control - even in limited capacity - of the weave. 

#### Mechanics
'Weftloader' refers to only one of the two essential parts of achieving the aim of replicating chalkweaving. There is the weftloader, the physical apparatus that does the physical weaving, and there is the absolutely necessary '**Weft Repli-Capable**' - or WRC - Slate that controls the weftloader.

The WRC Slate designation and weftloaders themselves were created by the purposely-established Nefelworks Corporation, or simply Nefelworks. Named after the Skydancer of Weave, the Dreamer Nefele, Nefelworks set about pursuing this technology to its utmost, developing a means for the Lancasters that primarily founded and staffed its corporate parent - Lancaster Innovations - to defend themselves, and later expand into civilian use. Many, many prototypes were built and plentiful resources were expended in reaching the state they occupy now, functional weftloaders built off of their most successful iteration of the tech, the foundation for all weave replication that would come after it; the **Needles V-1**. 

The WRC designation for a Slate is given to it when it passes the metrics necessary to become weave-replication capable. Primarily, it require the Slate to have certain scores and properties on its compute cube, as well as further thresholds met on other aspects, particularly that of pure calcic output. Generally, meeting WRC designation requires;

- For the compute cube;
	- A cube with a generally **high Potency (P) score**, this being a measure of its ability to yield raw calcic output.
	- A high **Adversity Compute Proficiency** value, as this is a direct measure of the compute cube's ability to compute Teks and calcic ritualism.
	- High scores in **pattern** handling, **extrapolation**, **biscuit** information handling and **multivariate** information handling.
- For the rest of the Slate;
	- Immensely high calcic throughput, made possible by high-throughput ribbon connections between the components of the Slate.
	- A calcic baseplate made of fairly aged, fairly complex chalkweave.

Generally, the Slate must be maximally capable of non-information-focused computation, focusing instead on the ability to create and disseminate calcic pattern to periphery.

The weftloader itself, the second piece of the puzzle, is a fairly complex piece of kit, as it aims to replicate mechanically what traditional chalkweavers do innately with their lattices. The silhouette of most forms of weftloader begins primarily as a large gauntlet, which encases the hands, but additionally continues past the writs, up the forearm and past the elbow, usually up to the shoulder, with other models featuring additional constituent parts on the chest or - more preferably - the back.

We can look at the 'parts list' almost for the most prolific weftloader in service, the Needles V-1, to get around understanding this;

- Critical to any weftloader is the **ambient/active intakes**. To weave chalk, it must first be accumulated by some means, and without the mechanics of drawing chalk to oneself to saturate the potential strait that is available to those with the Five Straits, the weftloader must accomplish this by other means. The Needles utilize a bit of pale amaranthite, contained in modified **weft compressors**, set to draw ambient chalk from the environment and compress it down to near-hyperweave state, providing incredibly dense - but worryingly volatile - chalk storage. The volatility problem is solved in part by having the compressed chalk stored in a vitric glass chamber of immense purity, such that the chalk going unstable will be instantly annihilated by the glass walls.

- Following this are **spools**, and the weftloader needs many. Without an internal memory strait like the Five Straits, the Slate and the attached weftloader must thus have various equations and ritual schema loaded onto their local storage, in the form of high-density spools. Stored weft and schema information is passed to the Slate for computation - as this information is usually stored in dedicated storage on the weftloader, as even high-end Slates rare have enough storage for even a medium-sized ledger of weft pattern - and then passed back to the weftloader as instructions on how to articulate the business end of the entire assemble.

- The weftloader's **stitchery array** is perhaps the most important part of the entire device, and it is what earned the Needles V-1 their name. The stitchery array for the Needles is a secondary, complex mechanical hand that folds over the main hand and articulates as it articulates normally. When not in use, it coils and folds away in sections around the wrist. When it needs to weave chalk however, instruction is fed to high-fidelity actuators on the spinmetal fingers' assembly, and a stream of chalk emanates from the palm. A series of tiny needles - much like knitting needles - then sprout from all over the finger assembly, particularly prominent ones emerging from the fingertips, and set about to the task of making tens of thousands of minuscule movements per second, the fingers themselves moving as well, stitching and weaving the stream of chalk provided into by the Slate into shape, done so along the instructions fed by the same Slate. Simple gestures can detach the woven pattern from the array. 

#### Further Notes
Weave replication is an immensely compute and resource-heavy task, especially when taken to the realm of Teks and the weftloader subdivision, **tekloaders**. The vast complexity of Teks requires even more exacting Slates and weftloader apparatus, in particular Teks need immensely large spools to store their equational entirety, as well as the various functions they possess when used in various manners. But the utility of tekloaders remains undeniable, placing some of the Switchboard's greatest forms of calcic power to the hands of those who cannot even wield weave.

Additionally, it is fairly commonplace for a weftloader to be integrated onto the local lattice as a **chromegraft**, taking over an arm entirely and granting additional potency and function due to higher-fidelity connections from closer integration. It makes the conduction of the will even swifter, and empowers the users of weftloaders even further. 

## Net-Compute Intersectionality
The anarhiza root network presented an all-new frontier upon which battles will be fought, not with blade and bullet, but with information, compute, and the means of conducting will and giving it form. New battles take place on the Glasswire, and new tools and tactics must be employed to fight and win. Presiding over these frontiers, the battles fought upon them and the tools used to wage them, are various bodies of Third Kin, concerned with the affairs of glasswire or computation, and often both. Each has their own contributions, just as each has their own - occasionally shadowed - ends.

### Research, Management and Other Relevant Authorities
The Third Kin have concerned themselves with the affairs of the net and compute to varying degrees and and for varying reasons, leading to the formation of a very many number of bodies that overseer and contribute to these spheres of knowledge.

### The Breach Protocol
In the time of the Praxis Conflicts, the Third Kin needed to discover the location of the Vitric Trinary Minds, Minds that were capable of weaponizing the negentropic, weave-eating glass of the Vitric Shelf against the Third Kin. To do so, they needed a means to breach the various strongholds of the First Thinker Minds at the time; the Mind Nexuses where multiple Minds could be domiciled and stage various offensive operations, and the far more prolific Vaults. These Vaults were created and presided over by the Interdictory Minds of the Interdiction Collective. These colossal megastructures served as large caches of both information and objects, particularly the ruins of the long-annihilated Vermeil civilization. They were in turn guarded by powerful praxis-reliant shields, channeling the Mind's doctrine of protection, and the Mind's partially autonomous swarm of defensive machine-spawn known as the chromelings. To enter a Vault then, was no easy feat.

But a path emerged for the Third Kin. The discovery of the anarhiza root network from reverse-engineering the Mind's chromeling swarms further revealed that the Minds operated on this network using constructs that would later come to be known as **isolNets** or isolated networks. These isolNets served as the command and control networks for a Vault's internal and external defenses, controlling their defensive swarms, weapon installations and the praxis shield. It was theorized that if the Third Kin could develop a means to 'invade' these isolNets, they could seize control and thus shut down the defenses of the Vault.

However, the Minds were crafty, and the reason why their isolated networks were called such is due to their physical insulation on the Vitric Boundary, made possible by the Mind-deployed installation of the **Glasswall**, a physical sheathing of the anarhiza roots used by the Mind's networks with the chalk-scorning glass of the Shelf above. It proved terribly effective at preventing roots of the anarhiza from growing and connecting to the isolated network, linking it to the larger anarhiza root network and allowing unauthorized access by the Third Kin, for example. Without a means to access the Mind's networks, the Third Kin were unable to tap into their information relays and contend with the Vaults.

And then the Third Kin engineered the Slates. 

Study into glass, glasswire, the anarhiza and its root networks began yielding considerable fruit, the Pan-Danciran Glasswire Research coalition and the Vermeilion Compute Society working together to devise a means to - against all known logic at the time - deploy something of a 'chalkweave pickaxe' over the root network, that would be capable of breaching the walls of the anarhiza root it travelled within, 'drilling' through the chalk-glass complex matter of the Vitric Boundary, reaching the Glasswall of an isolated network, somehow breaking through this glass, and then establishing a link between the isolNet and the wider anarhiza root network, ending its isolated status and allowing access. 

The mechanics of breaching the walls of the anarhiza root had already been mastered; even before the Third Kin began attacking the isolNets of the Minds, they began laying groundwork for small nets - particularly straitNets - of their own, linking important settlements and installations such as arcologies, Spyndl Academy outposts, and various basecamps on active battlefronts. The logistical guide lattice was indeed built by burrowing into the substrate of the Vitric Boundary and establishing guide posts of sorts with calcic ritualism, and thus it simply became a matter of extending this burrowing further; full-on drilling through the substrate of the Vitric Boundary.

The means of doing so was made possible by harnessing a modified model of the braced-weft packet typically used to transfer information down glasswire across the Dancirah. By replacing the logistical ledger that caps a packet with a ritualism-powered **breach ledger**, a packet could cut through the walls of the anarhiza root and enter the Vitric Boundary, the ritualism in the breach ledger powered by the chalk in the chalk-glass complex substrate that makes up the Vitric Boundary. As it digs, it leaves behind an almost pure glass tube that will be useful later. Upon hitting the boundary of the Glasswall, a payload of complex chalk encased in the packet is allowed to make contact with the Glasswall, triggering a negentropic interaction, but one that is intended to occur. As the glass makes contact, the complex weave in the packet's payload is spontaneously ejected into the surrounding area, and as is glass' nature by virtue of praxis, it is peeled away from the Glasswall in pursuit of the complex weave, exposing the anarhiza root underneath.

Utilizing the nearly pure glass tube left behind by the breach ledger's burrowing, the roots of the anarhiza from both the isolNet and the larger root network feed on the glass and utilize absorbed chalk to grow their roots from both ends of the cylindrical cavity, forming a connection of anarhiza root between them, and compromising the isolated status of the target network. With this glasswire established, it then becomes a battle fought with packets as both net attackers and net defenders deploy countermeasures to prevent the incursion from failing or succeeding, but establishing this physical connection over the Vitric Boundary with glasswire is essential for any and all operations.

As such, it was dubbed the **Breach Protocol**. In time, as it became far more commonplace for the Third Kin to breach networks, the Breach Protocol would take on a praxis component, and truly become an astrolabic protocol. Otherwise unreachable nets became not so, as the praxis of the Third Kin's breaching of one net was harnessed in the breaching of the next one. The praxis component of it all is elaborated upon further. 

Beyond merely physical penetration, various other means of combating the Mind's net defensives were developed. Breaching unseen, turning netfrastructure against their builders, information infiltration and exfiltration, group offensives to attack nets from multiple physical entry points, means of locking the Mind out of their own nets. Inevitably the Third Kin learned to breach and take control or plunder information from their own Kin-built nets, but it was widely accepted that this was an inevitability with all tools - the hammer problem, as it were. At the center of it all - the hammer, as it were - was the Slate, it simply being the only tool realistically capable of breaching the isolNets and conducting all manners of breach operations, further solidifying its power and purpose, and place among the Third Kin.

> But breaching isolNets and opposing Minds would come to take on an entirely new dimension when Skydancer Ryjik, the Eater, and the first of the Third Kin to truly conquer glass and the Vitric Shelf would arise, this being elaborated upon further on.

With the Slate and the Breach Protocol, the attacking of Vaults in the Switchboard became a science and perhaps even an art, in a practice that was dubbed '**Kache Krashing**'. 

### Vaults and Kache Krashing
This sections discusses the primarily means by which the Breach Protocol has been used; opposing both the Interdictory and Emergent Vaults that exist in the Dancirah.

### The Teeth of Ryjik
In the final stages before what would come to be known as the Fourth Offensive and the attack on the Trinary Complex, the Third Kin were forced to confront the reality that was their inability to traverse the Vitric Shelf, the domain of the Trinary Minds that staged the entire offensive against the Third Kin. But the Third Kin's unmatched resolve and dominion over the affairs of weft and the Astrolabe set about forging a solution; a grand Structural Cast to skew the Astrolabe's calculus, and incite into being a means to defeat glass and the Vitric Shelf.

Born with teeth of crystal and a star in his stomach, the Seventh Skydancer, Ryjik the Eater, arose. In his nature was the knowledge and ability to defeat glass, and with him in tow, Spyndl Academy and the Third Kin took the fight to the Vitric Shelf, struck against the Trinary Minds in their grand complex, and secured one of the most decisive victories for the Third Kin, and securing another - perhaps the greatest - foothold into the Era of the Third Kin. 

But Ryjik could do more than just 'defeat' glass. His ability to defeat glass came from his strange ability to consume it, irrespective of purity, and in doing so, render it inert. This inert glass manifested in the various regions of the Switchboard as a biome written into their regional equations. This inert glass - this, **scintillate** as it came to be called - became a fixture of the chromatic biomes that emerged following the rise of Skydancer Ryjik, and glass in this form came to be harnessed by the Third Kin, the mechanics of doing so taught by the Skydancer himself.

Compiled in a tome titled *The Writ of the Eater*, Skydancer Ryjik outlined the first rules and schematics of what would come to be the **glass ritualism**; chalk ritualism that used glass as a component, with scintillate acting as a buffer between the complex chalk ritual and the complexity-shredding glass it sought to utilize. He recorded the affects scintillate had on the lattice when consumed; glass would destroy the lattice of all who consumed it, but scintillate behaved differently - almost like a mind-altering 'drug' - dependent seemingly on the color of the scintillate.

But the most storied bit of knowledge acquired from the inquiry of Ryjik was in the making of weaponry. Before the attack on the Trinary Complex in the Vitric Shelf, Skydancers Onuris, The Hammer, and Ryjik, the Eater, collaborated in shaping a weapon. A weapon that harnessed chalk, glass, their stable crystalline-complex and the scintillate glass-inversion. It was called the **PRISMpick**, and it had power that spanned the glasswire and the Dancirah. With it, with a single strike, it could breach and seize control of any glasswire network, any computational device, carve a path into any Vault, sunder any weave, undo any ritualism. Within it was the power of Skydancer Ryjik; the power to eat, and render impotent. 

The PRISMpick was the first of the weapons that would come to be known as the **Teeth of Ryjik**. With their power and nature known and yet not fully explored, they became incredibly coveted. Forging them is no easy task, as glass is a material that actively opposes being worked upon. As such, so few of them exist that they have attained the status of myth, the PRISMpick itself being lost during the Refrain. This has only cultivated more interest in forging more of them, by any means possible, as those who wield them are believed to be able to defeat any obstacle to their aims, be it chalkweaver or glasswire construct. 

For now, the only ones suspected to truly have or be able to forge Teeth weaponry are Skydancer Ryjik's apostolics within the Sil'khan Sabai; nomad-zealots that worship the the Skydancer's and live to spread their words. Ryjik's faithful in particular - the Eaters of Ryjik - laud themselves as crusaders against the Vaults in the Switchboard, reenacting the purpose for which Ryjik arose to begin with.  

### The Glazwyre
> Consider this section a proposal-class document on its own, discussing a subject matter that could use a fair bit more development before it is considered fully part of the canon.

The mechanics of praxis have facilitated the existence of many things and concepts in the Switchboard, granting power and meaning to the mundane, causing them to arise, become transcendent, and achieve a physicality to their form that makes them yet another tangible oddity in the ledgers of the Dancirah. It is suspected by some that similar happened to the anarhiza root network, and the DevitNet when it later arose; that this interconnectedness across vast space seeded a praxis of connectedness itself, and thus spawned a pseudo-realm of which connection and communication were a core doctrine.

The first to notice it were the Netmasters.

The many bodies that contributed to the study, founding, development and implementation of the various spheres of communications and compute in the Dancirah would inevitably spawn odder folks in their ranks, who were cursed - perhaps - with opinionated dispositions matching only their undeniable genius. Asymmetry in philosophy caused the many earliest builders of the DevitNet and related subject matter to scorn the once hallowed offices where this building took place. They went out into the Dancirah and sought to shape the DevitNet in their own images, along their own philosophies. Become territorial warlords of astro-geographical-mirrored glasswire space, they became the Netmasters; self-appointed arbiters of information flow itself. 

The running of their glasswire empires required a relationship - a connection - with the anarhiza network that could not be achieved through the crude - comparatively - methodology of a mindspun-powered compute cube socketed into a clunky sarcophagus of ribbon cable and dull periphery. No, the conduction of the will needed to be expedited. It was not enough to simply speak, the Netmasters sought to be *felt*, to exist not merely as users *of* the DevitNet and the wider nets, but to become phenomena *within it*. Not so much gods, as they would come to be accused of, but as laws, that the will of a Netmaster would passively shape the glasswire territory under domain.

Achieving the supreme conduction of the will required a willingness to go where others had not gone, and do what others only whispered of in the hushed footnotes of ethically-burdened institutions. None remember the first Netmaster who cultivated anarhiza under his very skin, but all grew to understand that it was the bare minimum of what was necessary. None remembered who devised the means of running one's self under the simplifying knife of the vitric glass and transiting to a state capable of running down the glasswire, but all were aware of the fact a space formed to accommodate those who sought greater connection, a means to communicate - perhaps - between strait and strait. The entirety of oneself and will, speaking directly into another.

The called it the **Glazwyre**. Hallowed was its name.

To reach the Glazwyre, one must consolidate oneself down to merely their will, and delve into the glasswire, exposing themselves to the mechanics of doctrine and praxis, and being granted entry to the upper room. Within the Glazwyre, pure will is allowed and used to shape the goings-on of the nets below, perhaps made possible by speaking directly to the heart of the anarhiza itself. Within the Glazwyre, answers to its questions are scare - scarcer still outside of it, but this hallowed domain being the plane upon which the DevitNet's and Dancirah's Netmasters operate has made them its de-facto highest authorities. Their power is not limitless, but appears this is more a product of there having been no one who forged this path before, and taught those behind them how to walk it. 

The final concern, of course, is what the Netmasters truly are - perhaps what they've become - and above all, what are their ends. Many espouse a vision of a 'freeNet', one without oversight of any kind, allowed to grow and thrive, the only doctrine being endless proliferation. But skeptics remain so, believing that the Netmasters, shrouded in shadow as they are, have aims not dissimilar from many others in the Switchboard; grand chisel-blows in the slate-ledgers of the Current, actions that will ensure their names transcend death itself.
