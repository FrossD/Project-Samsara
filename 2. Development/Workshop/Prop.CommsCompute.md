### Calcodynamics and Vitreodynamics Interplay
> Required reading;
> [[The Hands as Chalk]]
> [[Glass]]

Chalk and glass interact destructively - or rather in a negentropic manner; when glass encounters chalkweave, it works towards 'regularizing' it, by destructively simplifying it and propagating more of itself in the void of entropy created. It works almost like a virus, destroying host chalk as it propagates itself, and spreading to devour more and more weave.

![[Glass#^cfe87b]]

However;

![[Glass#^ab6fc2]]

In a sense, 'glass cannot abide chalk' is better stated as '**under certain conditions, glass cannot abide chalk**' - which naturally implies that there are circumstances under which it *can*. Generally, the negentropic reaction between glass and chalk is a product of two major parameters;
- The complexity of the calcic sample.
- The purity of the glass in question.

And a number of minor ones;
- The shape of glass and chalk in question.
- Ambient calcic and vitric conditions.
- Non-natural interfering factors such as chalk ritualism.

With that established, it is possible for chalk and glass to interact in minimally destructive and even relatively *constructive* manners, based on control and modification of the relevant parameters. There are even cases and circumstances where stable **chalk-glass complexes** can be in nature, and they can be used in a litany of ways just like many of the Switchboard's other esoteric materials.

How to harness chalk-glass complexes then, is a matter of ingenuity, and one such examples of this is in the creation of **glasswire**.

### Glasswire
With a fair bit of precision, one can create a chalk-glass complex in the shape of a hollow tube, and then shove a round slug of chalk-glass complex into it, this slug having differing percentages of chalk and glass in its make-up than the surrounding chalk-glass tube. Upon the edge of the slug touching the lip of the tube, a small negentropic reaction takes place that converts a minuscule amount of chalk in the tube to glass, but in doing so reduces the amount of chalk at that section of the slug. Glass, in its **praxis-dictated** hunger for chalk, seeks to consume more chalk, and in doing so exerts an **attractive force** on quantities of it, which serves to pull the slug forward, and consume more of the chalk in its makeup. Once it reaches the end of the tube, the slug would have reduced minimally in mass and size, as the outer layer of the chalk-glass complex has been stripped off.

This peculiar behavior is observed only in chalk-glass complexes, that being that when chalk is introduced, glass seems to obtain the ability to **passively harness its praxis properties** as encoded in the Astrolabe's ontological ledgers. The result of this is samples of chalk-glass that recognize their own impurity, and thus work towards rectifying that by consuming chalk in the vicinity and converting it to glass, in doing so, raising the percentage and thus purity of glass in its make-up, allowing it to deplete the minuscule chalk present in its complex structure, to become pure glass. It is this attractive force of glass' hunger that can be harnessed to send objects down ducts of glasswire.

It was theorized then, that if a lattice of glasswire exists, it would be possible to send bits of weave down them, like messages written on paper in plastic tubes, fired down larger, pressurized air ducts. One would have to design a format of 'package' to send down these glasswires however, and this would indeed come later.

> It wouldn't be too farfetched to say that chalk-glass displays a kind of capillary action with varying purities of itself, and this model in mind aids greatly in understanding the functionality of glasswire. 

### The Braced-Weft Packet Doctrine
Referring to old notes;

![[The Hands as Chalk#Pattern and 'Ribbon' Duality]]

The section above on pattern-ribbon duality tells us about the dual nature of chalk in woven and ribbon form. An object can indeed be 'unfolded' down to calcic ribbon, and should a sufficient equation be provided, it is then possible to 'refold' that ribbon back into the original object. 

It is worth remembering that interactions in the Switchboard happen at the ribbon level. The calcic ribbon being the building block of the Switchboard necessitates many macroscopic functions have microscopic foundations. As the first experimenters began to experience with glasswire, they realized that pushing slugs of chalk down it required these slugs to be prepared, or 'packaged' in some manner, so that they could slip unimpeded down the glasswire instead of being torn to pieces by chalk. They began to call these hypothetical chalk slugs '**packets**', for simply representing packets of information.

One of the first realizations was that packets needed to be small, to fit down varying diameters of glasswire with minimal destructive interaction. There needed to be a way to pack what would normally be considerable amounts of information - and thus a large, very physical quantity of ribbon-chalk - down to as small a space as possible, without compromising on the integrity of that information, or accidentally creating hyperweave. 

The first postulated ideas were ways of partially weaving ribbon, to form more dense, but neat packages of ribbon chalk that could fit in the small diameters of the glasswire, but it then became a task of having every device that interfaced with such glasswire needing a means to weave ribbon before pushing it down the glasswire. There were also additional problems of how the dense package of information created complexity, and this would cause the walls of the glasswire to be more inclined towards destroying it.

The final solution was taken from studying, rather curiously, the backbone weaves of the Switchboard's great families. Analysts of the field realized that the backbone weaves that could be identified in individual members of each family contained information common to all of them, but also information that was incredibly simple in composition, often simply having what could be described as numerical quantities assigned to simple descriptive traits.

It was theorized that packets could be constructed similarly; an amount of chalk ribbon wound around a central backbone, and this backbone would contain immensely common, general information, while the ribbon around it would contain specificity, and components on both ends of the glasswire - sender and receiver - would sort and bisect information in this manner when sending, and stitch it back together when being received.

It came to be called the **dictionary brace** at first, due to how much it simplified and expedited the sending of textual information. Later, it was referred to more generally as the **glasswire packet weft brace**, encompassing all forms of ribbon sent down the glasswire. 

> A diagrammatical representation of this is necessary.

This, however, solved the information transfer aspect of the entire affair. The final model of a glasswire packet was series of concentric cylinders. At the core was the weft brace, which served to store the larger, more common information contained in weave. Around that central cylinder was the rest of the packet's information load, this being the stripped and simplified information ribbon, containing the bulk of the more specific information in the packet. The next cylindrical layer after this is a layer of 'dummy' chalk. This acts as fuel and shielding for the movement of the packet through the glasswire, being immensely simple to disincline the walls of the glasswire from devouring it too swiftly.

Facilitating the movement of the package is a measure of chalk-glass at the under or rear of the entire packet assembly, which prompts the destructive propulsion that moves the entire packet down the glasswire. At the top or front of the packet is a complex bit of chalk ritualism known as the **logistical ledger**. This component interfaces with a bit of infrastructure placed by the Third Kin when they came to finally harness the naturally-occurring example of glasswire permeating the Dancirah.

> A diagrammatical representation of this is necessary.

### Spool Storage and Dynamics
Information taking physical form in the Switchboard necessitated a way to store it. This information being primarily ribbon made the means of storing it fairly obvious; physical **spools** around which immense lengths of ribbon are wound. As the information needs to be read, a bit of it is fed through smaller spools that pass ribbon over reader apparatus linked to compute cores - this particular functionality being explained fairly later. 

These spools of ribbon being chalk themselves, however, makes them somewhat vulnerable to various phenomena. A chalkweaver activating their active draw in an environment full of spools can absorb their calcic matter and thus utterly destroy a large data hoard. Other chalk-consuming phenomena make little discrimination between ambient chalk and chalk in spools, and thus it is vary possible for an active ritual - for example - to unwind the contents of a spool and consume it as raw chalk.

For this reason, spools are usually physically insulated, with larger mass-storage spools being stored and their contents fed like a belt over rollers to where they are needed to be read. Spools meant for usage in devices such as slates, or spools that are generally more mobile are instead incased in glass chambers, which insulate them from the outside calcic world, maintaining the integrity of the data within. 

## The DevitNet
The resultant of many processions spent understanding the interactions between chalk and glass, and coming to harness the naturally occurring example of a perfect, stable fusion of the two. 

### The Anarhiza
Many concepts in the Samsara canon stem from a narrative design vision of the Switchboard to contain a litany of wholly natural features that are creatively used by its denizens to their own ends. Much like installing a waterwheel on a river flowing powerfully down a mountain, the Third Kin are envisioned as constantly seeking ways to use their surroundings to their advantage, which plays perfectly in the particularly-strider mantra of exploration; the necessity of finding new 'surroundings' to make use of.

A realization of this is the Anarhiza. Much like the various other horticultural components employed by Striders in their rituals and elsewhere ([[The Voice in Flowers]]), the tree that is the Anarhiza - more properly known as the **Verrphagic Anarhiza** (glass-eating upside-down root) - is unique in it's ability to exist in both the Switchboard and the Vitric Shelf. The tree seemingly originates from the Shelf, as it most peculiarly grows upside down; it's roots stretching skywards into semi-tangible shimmer where it crosses the boundary between the Shelf and the Switchboard - before phasing out of sight and reality totally - while its branches and leaves grow downwards into the Switchboard, soaking up chalk like sunlight. The roots of the anarhiza are said to occupy an intangible 'boundary plane' between the Vitric Shelf and the Dancirah, much like the Challenger Horizon that cordons off the deep from the sky.

Even more curiously, no individual Anarhiza exists, studies on it concluding that every single 'individual' Anarhiza is merely another branch of a far greater progenitor tree to which all Anarhiza are linked through their roots. That, supposedly, every new tree planted grows its roots into the Shelf and meets a collection of roots already present, which it fuses with, becoming another node on that ancient, endless network, seemingly spanning the entire Switchboard.

But the quality of the anarhiza that led to a revolution of the operation of the Switchboard was that its roots were naturally-occurring chalk-glass complexes. Even more absurdly, they were hollow, and thus the roots of the anarhiza were, in fact, natural **glasswire**. Coupled with the fact that the anarhiza was one, singular, plane-spanning organism, it was theorized and then proven that chalk in packet form could be moved from any one point in the 'root network' to any other point in it. The value of this was instantly obvious; a means for high-speed communication across the entire Dancirah.

It came to be called the Dendro-Vitric Network; the **DevitNet**.

### The Dendro-Vitric Network
The Dendro-Vitric Network, or **DevitNet**, refers to a colossal, fragmented, Dancirah-spanning megastructure built upon the ancient anarhiza's network of roots occupying the boundary between the Dancirah and the Vitric Shelf. With every point on the root network being connected to every other point by means of endlessly branching paths, it is possible to send chalk from one point to another on the DevitNet, thereby facilitating high speed communications throughout the entire Switchboard. 

For a device to be able to send and receive chalk - communicate - on the DevitNet, it needs to be fitted with a number of compatibility modifications. Primarily, this is a cutting from the anarhiza, which feed on chalk through their miniscule leaf structures to propagates their roots into the fourth spatial dimension, where the boundary between the the Dancirah and the Vitric Shelf lies. The roots of the anarhiza live within this boundary, however, not traversing it completely to emerge in the Vitric Shelf.

When a device is fitted with a cutting from the anarhiza, a packet as described above can be 'pumped' into its branch structures, where it is taken in easily due to the anarhiza's affinity for both glass and chalk. It passes through its trunk, and then reaches the beginning of the roots of the tree, where it delves into the **Vitric Boundary**. In there, the packet of chalk would normally travel down whatever route the destructive interaction of chalk and glass sees fit to propel it, but the earliest builders of the DevitNet rectified this by using **logistical ledgers**.

Before the anarhiza's roots could be used for the intensely involved infrastructure its imagined use case demanded, various modifications had to be made to the root network first. One such modification was the 'installation' of a **logistical guide lattice** within the Vitric Boundary, this being done by devising 'devices' composed almost entirely of calcic ritualism that could enter the root network, burrow *out* of the anarhiza's roots into the substrate of the Vitric Boundary, and deploy minuscule spherical structures containing a bit of calcic ritualism. When a packet with a logistical ledger built into its physical structure comes near one of these spherical **guideposts**, and the ritualism in the ledger has been appropriately engineered, the two ritual constructs in both will briefly interact, causing a minor deflective force. Placed at junctions, these boundary guideposts ensure packets go exactly where they are sent. 

It is worth discussing some of the implications of the DevitNet being built upon the natural structure of the anarhiza's roots. 

While the Anarhiza does allow communication across the Switchboard, it is more correct to say that it allows communication anywhere the tree is present. Though the tree occurs naturally, occasionally Striders must go to far-flung areas of the Switchboard to plant new ones to link new settlements or establish relay stations, as well as maintain old trees to avoid parts of the network collapsing. 

The Switchboard's functionally internet-analogue is considerably similar to ours, but for the nontrivial difference that, for the most part, the entirety of the DevitNet is conducted on what can be described as hardline cable. This hardline cable being the anarhiza also means that the entirety of the DevitNet's digital space **is a mirror of the Dancirah's cosmo-geographical structure**. 

The DevitNet is thus divided along lines similar to that of the Dancirah's, with cradles existing in the DevitNet that house collections of users. One of the consequences of this is that breaks in the hardline cabling that is the glasswire can leave the corresponding cosmo-geographical locale isolated from the rest of the DevitNet, and thus the Switchboard, and cabling that needs to break for this to happen are usually fairly easy to locate through following the physical branch cables until they converge into large central arteries moving titanic amounts of information. 

Thus, maintenance of the DevitNet is a tireless, unending task, undertaken by coalition forces, primarily Sil'khan and Lancasters - especially when considering the sabotage of DevitNet infrastructure is a common tactic of Vault Minds and unscrupulous parties.

One this note, we can look more into the infrastructure of the DevitNet.

### Netfrastructure
The infrastructure of the DevitNet is a matter of subdivisions. Colossal things serve a number of large things, which serve a number of medium-sized things, which serve a number of small things, which *yet* serve a number of *yet smaller* things. In this manner, the DevitNet is very hierarchical, both reflected and created by its infrastructure.

Perhaps the largest single element of netfrastructure, though not in the manner one initially assumes, are the various Interdictory Vaults in the Switchboard that are the domains of the Interdiction Minds that survived the Second Praxis conflict and the Mind Hunts, so many processions ago. The Minds tapped into, and learned to harness the anarhiza network long before the Third Kin did, and in fact still use it today, though they do so primarily on isolated or 'gated' networks that are deliberately disconnected from the larger anarhiza network. While the Interdictory Vaults don't exactly let the Third Kin use their glasswire to move their own information, the fact that the Vaults and the Minds within operate on even isolated sections of the DevitNet is important for reasons stated later.

With that being said, the then largest piece of netfrastructure operated by the Third Kin are simply called **nexuses**. These nexuses contain by way of operation, considerably large anarhiza trees, and multiple of them too. The root-glasswire emanating from them is particularly large, allowing colossal information throughput. These nexuses are often as large as starships, and are marked as major points of interest in starmaps and wedge ledgers. Most are entire operating platforms built deep in the Starwylds, doubling as outposts for nomads and positions for various organizations and coalitions to establish a presence. When particularly large information transfers need to be made, it is generally encouraged to do so at nexuses, to avoid clogging up smaller glasswire with their reduced throughput. 

Following nexuses are the unceremoniously named **sub-nexuses**, and following them, **cradle nexuses**, which usually serve an individual cradle in a sector of the Sky, this being any number of regions, wellsprings, sky installments and many other less permanent installations such as passing jump and starships. **Orbital Net Relays** usually orbit a region, and feed glasswire from cradle nexuses down to the region's various settlements below. These **ground-based net relays** are an umbrella term for a vast collection of centralized netfrastructure that shrink further as they finally reach the end user and netizen in the Dancirah. Those who can afford to establish them usually have personal ground-stations for linking into the DevitNet, though these are generally to be found in region-side cities and arcologies and in use by large organizations such as the Spyndl Academy's many branches and outposts.

Connecting the various divisions of nexuses are differing classes of glasswire, varying by size and thus, information throughput. One of the major constraints of the DevitNet is that it isn't possible to 'widen' or generally replace existing anarhiza roots, due to the relative impossibility of macroscopic operations within the Vitric Boundary. Planting entirely new anarhiza is necessary to increase the **net throughput** to a locale of the Switchboard.

Some smaller sub-netfrastructure exists, this being an umbrella term for various Net-enabled components such as Net Buoys that exist. In particular, there is the **microlNet**.

### The microlNet and Isolated Networks
It is possible to set up secondary and isolated networks - **isolNets** - under the main anarhiza root network, to serve various functions. This is a particularly involved process, as a major point in the existing DevitNet's favor is exactly that - the fact it already exists. Setting up **gated networks** requires planting large amounts of anarhiza over huge swathes of inter-regional space, and can only really be achieved on small scale for private usage, on relative large scale by very coordinated, very large organizations and coalitions, or '**straitNets**' that describe gated networks that link two points, or a small number of them.

Perhaps the most successful example of the development and deployment of a secondary, isolated network is the **microlNet**, a high-speed, low throughput network that operates under immensely stiff regulation, presided over by net authorities and the Spyndl Academy. It runs alongside most of the major starship and striding routes in the Switchboard, and serves primarily the purposes of critical information relay, and being an isolated purpose-built network for handling emergencies. Downed starships, Striders who have fallen into the Void, the sudden appearance of an Interdictory Mind's swarm of chromelings, a flux storm or stellar procession beginning out of season, and a large list of many other esoteric yet plausible occurrences - the microlNet exists to ensure critical communications are never obstructed by having to take the main paths on the DevitNet. For this reason, its infrastructure is both incredibly hidden and immensely well-guarded, ensuring that none can sabotage it.

Interdictory Minds also operate their own isolNets, used primarily for issuing commands to their chromeling armies within and outside the Vaults, and communicating with other Interdictory Minds, to share information such as profiles on active Kache-Krashing teams - elaborated upon further. Breaching these nets is a common practice of Striders, in operations described further down. Emergent Vault Minds aren't particularly well-versed in the affairs of the Vaults, and as such usually lack isolated nets and chromeling defense mechanisms, usually having other quirks of their own to make up for it.

The physical substrate-space in the Vitric Boundary that separates isolNets has come to be called the **Glasswall**, and this term has been used to describe the act of isolating networks or things and concepts in general. 'Breaching the Glasswall' and uniting isolated nets with other nets and even the main DevitNet, is something explored further down. 

Many major organizations operate their own isolated nets, for internal sharing of information within the physical structure of an organization, and straitNets that link outpost to outpost. This brings us to discussing the various authoritative powers that control the DevitNet to varying extents.

### Netmasters and Management Authorities
A number of individuals, small groups and large organizations concern themselves with the affairs of the DevitNet and glasswire networks in general. Their functions and interests vary, expectedly, as do the power they exert over the vastness of the net. In particular order and not in their entirety are the following;

- The Pan-Danciran Glasswire Research Coalition
- The Endel Wyrewatch
- Spyndl Academy
- The Eaters of Ryjik
- Ivory Tower Glasswire Solutions
- The freeNet Netmasters
- ArcolNet Oversight Authorities

Elaborated upon further;

- The Pan-Danciran Glasswire Research Coalition
	- Research and innovation of much of the DevitNet knowledge and gadgetry.
- The Endel Wyrewatch
	- Serves multiple functions as establishers and maintainers of netfrastructure, and a policing/defense authority to protect that netfrastructure.  
- Spyndl Academy
	- Works with many other net-related groups, serving its shadowy goals and lending Operators to help or oppose others'. Spyndl with the help of the Ivory Tower and Wyrewatch developed the microlNet, in a bid to create a safer Switchboard.
- The Eaters of Ryjik
	- A Sabai religious faction, serving the Skydancer Ryjik the Eater. The deal in all matters of Glass and the Vitric Shelf in general, and are particularly involved in opposing Interdictory and Emergent Vault Minds. 
- Ivory Tower Glasswire Solutions
	- A Lancaster Innovations owned and operated provider of Netfrastructure to choice clientele, boasting enhanced security measures against breaches and the like.
- The freeNet Netmasters
	- A social, philosophical and self-proclaimed moral movement by small groups of shadowy individuals who oppose the monitoring and oversight of the Net by various other parties. The Netmasters have rather curiously obtained praxis powers from their convictions, and this has allowed them to explore and battle on the net in the between-space known as the Glazwyre.
- ArcolNet Oversight Authorities
	- A Fel-Arcad run overseeing body that manages the various isolNets and straitNets that connect Fel-Arcad arcologies.

## Switchboard Computation
In which we delve into understanding the various devices in the Switchboard that link up to and across the various nets, these being the Switchboard's computers. They are similar to traditional, existing computers in macroscopic function, but their microscopic fundamentals differ considerably, in that Switchboard computers harness the collective intelligence of lower beings to both compute, and perform functions that allow them to interface with local, calcic reality. 

### Computational Core Architecture
Critical to all computers in the Switchboard is the **calcic computational core**, colloquially known as the '**cube**' (3C).
