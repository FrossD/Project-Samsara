# Cryogen's Proposal: Spyndl Noon
The shaping of the most powerful singular institution to exist in the Switchboard; the Spyndl Academy, achieved through accounts of the events between the Refrain and the dawning Fourth Era.

**Details of the Operation**
In a sense, this is the precursor to what will eventually be **Dancirah's Noon**; the document that follows [[The Dawn of the Dancirah|Dancirah's Dawn]] in recounting the precursor lore of the Saraverse. Saying it now, it's very likely that DNoon won't be a singular document, but rather a centralized collection of decentralized lore that's amassed primarily from each family's individual histories - such as the Fel-Arcad's *They That Fell* as well as additional lore from other sources, such as larger factions that emerge down the development cycle or emerging ideas now (re: EPIT Proposal)

As such, the task then is to highlight possible events that could have occurred in the time between the Refrain and wherever whatever narrative adventure with Samsara begins.

## Spyndl Noon Drafting Table
### Rough
1. **The Mystics, Mysticism/Khateleya Incident**
	- Danseer **Salyne Khateleya**
	- Involved trying to create a 4th Thinker Generation
	- This is the one that involved Salyne Khateleya and a structural cast.
	- Salyne a surviving Danseer? (detecting a theme here)
	- Led to the formation of the Brass Monastery
2. **Trevelyan**
	- Trevelyan, the Traveling Mage and his 99 Tales. His Tek is that he cannot die from conventional means, and as such he has appeared in many places in Switchboard canon. Most noteworthy are his 99 Tales, stories compiled by him that inspire the followers of Trevelyan.
	- Also a **Danseer.**
	- Reputed to be a true Danseer who survived the Refrain, and aimed to do *something* (take over Spyndl, I don't know)
3. **Chrome's Graveyard**
	- All decommissioned Fel-Arcad chromegrafts were repossessed by Lancaster Innovations as a (recycling measure, general contract stipulation) and then dumped on a region for processing.
	- Character: Regional Administrator **Lisian Yanagi**
	- Daughter of Fel-Arcad and Danseer who survived the Refrain.
	- The mechanics of the mindspun resulted in the region being taken over by elementary intelligences spawned from the weave present in the decommissioned chromegrafts from previous owners. 
	- The region awoke and basically began to scream.
	- Lisian saw herself as a 'mother of chrome', and sought to 'rule' over the half-necro'd screaming minds of the chromegrafts under her control.
	- A multifaceted campaign began to take over the planet.
	- It scarred most who were involved, particularly due to the fact the Sil'khan did not know how to handle this otherwise loving and nurturing figure.
	- It led Spyndl to really evaluate what was being done to its Striders, as many also lost the power to stride in this incident.
4. **The Horizon Crisis**
	- Caused by a Daughter of Vahn beginning an incursion into the Dancirah.
	- Spyndl allied with Antamara, earning the consternation and enmity of the Vahnkin, leading to a further degradation of their relationship with Spyndl and the Dancirah-dwelling kin.
5. **Cardworks**
	- Danseer **Houdi Ricoel**
	- Utterly insane
	- An event caused by a Danseer who had survived the Refrain (lending credit to the claims of Trevelyan and thus happened before Trevelyan's incident).
	- Surviving the Refrain didn't leave him unscarred however.
	- He wielded particularly powerful chalkweaving in the form of two Teks; one that allowed him to duplicate his physical form, and another than made him impervious to all damage on the praxis level, unless the damage came from something that mirrored him in some regard.
	- He thus organized his clones of himself as a modification of the Tarot deck.
	- And Spyndl was forced to crack this code and organize themselves also as a mirror deck to defeat him.
	- This particular organization methodology stuck and became Spyndl's organization structure up until today.
6. **Op. Byte Back**
	- Leftover First Thinkers working alongside rogue Third Kin set out to attack and collapse the DevitNet, and propagate throughout the Switchboard by exploiting the weave-compute of connected machines to fold themselves into being.
	- Spyndl operatives had to oppose them by doing battle on two frontiers; on the macro level in Dancirah-space, and on the micro level in the net-space known as the Glazwyre (PHldr.). 
	- The Eaters of Ryjik were the only ones capable of fighting within the Glazwyre and shutting down the attacking minds, and had to work alongside the Netmasters who were the only ones who knew how to manifest entryways into it and navigating its landscape.
	- The Third Thinker working with them was a rogue Netmaster, who had to be shut down and eliminated by the Spyndl Operatives themselves.
	- Netmaster is a Lancaster, because they gotta get in on this too.
	- As a tentative note, they were working to secure information about the Nuver (refer to [[WN-DT]]).
	- As an additional note, it is when the Academy learned to wield Glass, made possible by the rediscovery of the PRISMpick after it was lost and then repossessed by the Netmasters.
	- Grounds for Io's JABBERlance.
7. **Panopticon Breach**
	- Ye olde prison break
	- SBL1 reference (real)
8. **Formation of the HighCastle Artisanry House**
	- Furnishing fleets of Sil'khan ships.
	- Building a fleet in general.
9. **Building the Modern DevitNet**
