This is a question that directly refers to the mechanics of pattern-ribbon duality and the Weave Protocol.

Quoting my own notes; 

> Because all things in the Switchboard are made of patterned chalk, it helps to view objects (such as a piece of fruit) as an origami of chalk 'paper'. When folded, it takes the form the name compels us to reasonably expect. However, when unfolded, a formerly three-dimensional object now becomes flat - chalk ribbons. These chalk ribbons still contain the information of the former **three-dimensional object, needing only instructions on 'folding' to be supplied to restore them to their original form. This is the Pattern-Ribbon Duality.**

- From the Hands as Chalk.

Additionally;
> Firstly, equations and rituals both do the same thing - fold chalk. The differences in how they do so is where the major difference arises. Equations fold chalk at the ribbon level, and *they too* exist at the ribbon level. Switchboard equations are much like phenomena; things are subjected to them and change occurs. To use an analogy, they can be viewed as a machine that takes in flat sheets of paper and outputs paper cranes. The Switchboard runs on equations that exist somewhat amorphously throughout it, responsible for the endless computations performed to produce the nature of the Switchboard as we know it.

> Where an equation simply needs to be fed ribbon chalk and it's arcane internal engines will do the rest...

- From Chalk Ritualism.

In a very real sense, it is possibly to simply weave matter from chalk as all matter *is* chalk, and weaving is merely a matter of subjecting chalk to an equation. Equations are stored in the memory strait and employed in the computational strait, and thus if a Weaver knew the equation to say, weave chalk into a pillow, they could indeed simply weave pillows into being.

The problem lies in the fact that there is no simple way to obtain the equation by which something is woven. If you unfolded a bit of origami, you can't conclusively determine when what folds are meant to be made by simply studying the creases, just as looking at the ribbon coil of an unwound pillow will make you no more capable at weaving pillows into being. 

This is why the **Chalk Ritualism** is such a thing. Replicating the arcane enginery of the equations is nigh impossible, so Weavers must settle instead for working with chalk at a macro level, and appeal to instead a different domain of arcane enginery, the difference being that this enginery speaks a language that we understand; that being the ritual components of **flowers**, **fire**, **maps**, and **marks**. You *could* then devise a ritual to create pillows, and while this is considerably more doable - and is in fact a fact that lies at the crux of the Fel-Arcad economy - you are burdened by the fact Ritualism is not without its own hazards. 

In which we come down to the matter of convenience. It is simply easier and safer for the denizens of the Switchboard to make pillows via macroscopic industrial processes than tinker with the arcane to do the same. Even if in the economic long-term it would make sense to crack the schema for making pillows from mere chalk and as few other ingredients as possible, the sheer time and resource investment necessary, plus the attached risks has made chalk ritualism a less-viable-than-previously-imagined means of accomplishing these things.

Of course, by saying "It's hard, but doable.", I am in turn saying that all we really need is someone determined enough. To that I have no rebuttal and even agree with you that yes, the Saraverse could indeed have a Weaver out there dedicated to devising a ritual schema for a pillow that never goes cold. And I'd argue the entire verse is all the better for it. It is an - admittedly - unwritten point that the equations for some things were desperately sought, the equation to create fire from chalk, for example, being among the first. But in a sense, that it is difficult and other means exist is why complex configurations of matter aren't being replicated at will, to the detriment of economics.

If the 'narrative issue' of creating wholesale copies of characters or brains at will hasn't been addressed above, allow me to state it more clearly; the equation to create a *person* is so unfathomably complex as perceived by both us and those in the verse as to be undoable. The ritual schema to create a person only slightly less so. Given infinite time and total immunity from the consequences of inquiry into this field, it could almost certainly be done, but under this criteria an intelligent mind could accomplish nearly anything. 

There is a single caveat I can think of and that takes the form of **shaping** as described in the documents on the Void. Shaping is a means of creating things from chalk by creating a vacuum of 'anti-information' in the Dancirah and having chalk fill it. If you were able to conceive of the *absence* of the ontology of a person, you could shape them from the miry clay of the Void. This caveat, however, has a more 'meta' caveat in the form of Void 5.0 being a thing, and thus this singular bit isn't set in anything more solid than my vision for Samsara as a universe. The value of that is in your hands to decide. 

## Pass #2
>The general “feeling” of Samsara is that replicating complex objects is prohibitively difficult; the more complex an object is, the more difficult it is to replicate. But by what mechanism is this the case?

The answer to the first question is, admittedly, a poor one. Much of chalk and the foundational mechanics of Samsara is built off of a design philosophy that centers the idea of playing fast and loose with physics. In a way, it has come back to bite us. My running assertion was that things that difficult to do under conventional means would only be slightly less difficult to do via calcic mechanics, but in a manner that allowed for far more things to be doable in general. 

Can you fuse hydrogen and oxygen at the ends of your fingertips in our universe? Unfortunately no. But in Samsara you can come close to it, utilizing the calcic ritualism to create water from things that are very much not water. But because chalk is easier to work with than atoms at the microscopic level, this translates almost directly to the macroscopic as well.

So why is making complex objects in Samsara difficult? I two answers. One is that I simply imagined that it should be. It was within the scope of my vision for Samsara that you could make high-power explosives using circles and a few knickknacks lying around, but the canon additionally demanded that this wasn't a power that would be afforded to damn anyone.

The second answer I have is a bit more... useful? Replicating something in Samsara is a matter of recreating a clone or copy of its information. There is something of a 'boundary' of sorts in Samsara definition that sees entities in the Saraverse be treated as unique from one another - a definite 'line' of sorts where one box's ontological entirety ends and an adjacent box's begins. To replicate everything within this boundary necessitates accounting for the information mass of it and how the chalk is packed. Complex things are thus 'heavier' information-wise, as more chalk is needed to encapsulate their existence. Additionally, we can refer to **Property Weave** under **Calcimistry**. Something more complex has more properties, and thus more that needs to be accounted for in its replication. And there is the final point of the folding of all this in a manner that actually creates what is meant to be replicated. There is a way to lay out the parts of a car on a tarp and fold that tarp such that the wheels and windshields end up in the right places, but again, it is terribly difficult to do so, especially when the only real means of doing so is trial and error. You do have the mechanics of calcic ritualism to help you, but it is considerably more expensive even if it is far more doable.

> Is “difficulty to replicate complex objects” compatible with a universe in which heat may be freely turned into kinetic energy? i.e. does a world where you can reverse entropy necessarily mean that the “complexity” of a problem doesn’t matter?

This is a hard one. A really hard one. I remember that we had a back and forth on this particular issue, especially as regards the problem of railguns not possibly working on capacitors as we understand them as electricity as we understand *it* doesn't exist. 

In the brief stint building Calcic Chemistry and Calcic Physics (docs I consider more exhausting to realize than the entire Fel-Arcad doc despite being about twenty times shorter) we created about three documents relevant to the subject;

- Prop.CalcicChemistry
- Post-Proposal Notes
- Calcimistry

Give these a look-through in the GitHub, because I haven't in a while. 

As I understand the question, any and every calcic process in the Switchboard doesn't have any real cost if what is expended in realizing it can be recovered - in fact - from what would normally be the unusable by-products of performing the process. It is, in a sense, the ability to cheat. To this I answer that I am not sure. Entropy in the Switchboard is not well defined, despite the fact Glass is a thing that exists. This is something that needs going over. Maybe a Proposal: Entropy. I love my job.

## Pass #3
> Related - in a world where you can reverse entropy, does P=NP?
Is there any safe cryptography in a world where P=NP?
Is P=NP subject to quantum computation?

I kind of understand this, and it's a rather nifty thing to wrap the head around. I'm going to test if I really get it though.

Suppose I am tasked to replicated a box via ritualism. I do so to the best of my ability. Creating the box via ritualism - the solving - is the easy part, but checking if these two boxes are ontologically identical is the hard part? 

Or I might have gotten it backwards.

I really do not know what to make of this all. What I do suspect is that I will have to rebuild Communications and Compute most likely. We will need to discuss this as well.

## Pass #4
> Regardless of whether they physically exist, are there other “exotic” forms of computation (non-classical and non-quantum) that either a) allow encryption to be broken or b) allow for new forms of “unhackable” encryption?
Do we have any idea what physics is required for these exotic forms of computation?
Is there a sort of computational "barrier" to obtaining the exact state of entropy of the system that generates a security key?
As in: suppose it's possible physically, and doesn't even cost you anything in terms of negentropy to do it; could it nonetheless be true that (for example) it takes the lifetime of the universe to calculate the exact state of entropy that generates a security key?
Can a “computation” run in such a way that it produces zero entropy? What restricts the “power” of such a computation? Size? Runtime?
Does a universe which allows for the replication of physical objects at will rely on a currency-system that is still purely physical? 
	no, if it has any capitalistic value

I have gotten frustrated, and even if I wasn't, I am unsure the answer to most of these. As we get further into questions on what can be done with things we haven't exactly built, the more necessary it becomes that we actually build these things. The takeaway from all this - that I can deduce anyway - is an **entropy problem**. 

## Pass #5
> If there is a natural hierarchy in place between normies and Striders; if only Striders are capable of replicating objects, do Striders need an economy of objects at all?
In general, since narratively it seems that Striders and normies don’t interact on the same social playing field, wouldn’t there be two largely decoupled economies between them?
If this is the case, is there an asymmetry in the decoupling between the two economies? For example, a Strider could easily make an economic killing in the normie market, but the purchasable goods would largely be worthless to a Strider who can create what they need on the fly. There doesn’t appear to be an analogue by which a normie can obtain wealth in the Strider economy.
A darker revelation: Striders could, if they so chose, create a post-scarcity society, liberating the universe from poverty. This is ultimately not possible indefinitely in our universe, as negentropy is a resource limited by the very laws of physics. But what prevents Striders from doing this in the Switchboard? Coordination problems? Conflicting utility functions?

Ironically, this is something I *can* answer, but won't for the time being. It is built upon a large amount of canon that just isn't established yet, and while I can give a workable answer, I'd prefer that we solve the problems above first. This we can come back to in time.
