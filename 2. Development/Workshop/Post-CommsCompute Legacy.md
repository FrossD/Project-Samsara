# SBTech Legacy
## SBTech: Information & Communication Technology
Distance is frequently both a bane and a non-issue for Striders in the Switchboard. Irrespective of that, communications and computer technology remain an essential element of the Switchboard. We detail the unique way these systems function.

### The Natural Systems
Telecommunications and the internet work primarily due to the existence of electromagnetism. Electromagnetic waves allow information to be transmitted across long distances, mostly unimpeded by obstacles such as unfavorable terrain - the largest roadblock faced by most communication methods that came before it.

The Switchboard - expectedly - functions rather differently. 

Much like the Astrolabe, the means by which Striders communicate over long distances is facilitated by natural, preexisting phenomena in the Switchboard; an invisible, almost intangible 'fabric' over the Switchboard known as the **Vitric Shelf**,and a species of tree that interacts with it in a most peculiar manner, known as the **Anarhiza**. Both working in tandem form the **Dendro-Vitric Network**, or the '**DevitNET**'; a lattice of communication relay structures spanning most of the Switchboard. 

#### The Vitric Shelf
As it stands now, [[The Vitric Shelf]] is a 'realm' lying 'above' the Switchboard, much like the Challenger Dark is one lying 'below' it. It serves two narrative purposes (so far); an explanation of where Glass comes from, and the subject of this section - Switchboard telecommunications. 

#### The Anarhiza
The Vitric Shelf and now the Anarhiza stem from a narrative design vision of the Switchboard to contain a litany of wholly natural features that are creative used by Striders to their own ends. Much like installing a waterwheel on a river flowing powerfully down a mountain, I envision Striders as constantly seeking ways to use their surroundings to their advantage, which plays perfectly in the Strider mantra of exploration; the necessity of finding new 'surroundings' to make use of.

A realization of this is the Anarhiza. Much like the various other horticultural components employed by Striders in their rituals and elsewhere ([[The Voice in Flowers]]), the tree that is the Anarhiza - more properly known as the **Verrphagic Anarhiza** (glass-eating upside-down root) - is unique in it's ability to exist in both the Switchboard and the Vitric Shelf. The tree seemingly originates from the Shelf, as it most peculiarly grows upside down; it's roots stretching skywards into semi-tangible shimmer where it crosses the boundary between the Shelf and the Switchboard - before phasing out of sight and reality totally - while it's branches and leaves grow downwards into the Switchboard, soaking up chalk like sunlight. 

Even more curiously, no individual Anarhiza exists, studies on it concluding that every single 'individual' Anarhiza is merely another branch of a far greater progenitor tree to which all Anarhiza are linked through their roots. That, supposedly, every new tree planted grows its roots into the Shelf and meets a collection of roots already present, which it fuses with, becoming another node on that ancient, endless network, seemingly spanning the entire Switchboard. 

It was also discovered that the leaves of the Anarhiza soak up chalk in the Switchboard to grow. A test found that ribbon chalk fed to it not just maintained its form, but seemingly was passed to its roots, replicated, and spread across the entire root network, and that the ribbon sent through one tree could be retrieved from another. This discovery led to the creation of the **Dendro-Vitric Network**, the Switchboard analogue to our internet.

#### The Dendro-Vitric Network
The Devit, or DevitNet as it's usually contracted to, is a network of Strider-built devices and apparatus that make use of the information-relaying power of the Anarhiza and the Vitric Shelf to pass information across the Switchboard.

Central to all network infrastructure is the Anarhiza and apparatus to interface with it, typically just the interface line of a Five-Strait chalk circle. The branches of the tree are linked to computers and other devices that are desired to be hooked up to the network, ribbon is fed through those branches, going up the length of the tree, into its roots and in to the Vitric Shelf where it is sequenced, replicated and spread over the entire network.

Devices made to be DevitNet compatible require Anarhiza derivatives such as branch cuttings or root fibers to be present in their assembly. This links them to the network and allows them to communicate with other devices.

Though information is sent to the entire DevitNet, encryption systems are in place to ensure senders can control what receivers can read transmitted information. Encryption and decryption is handled by the devices hooked up tot the Anarhiza before the message is sent to the Shelf.

While the Anarhiza does allow communication across the Switchboard, it is more correct to say that it allows communication anywhere the tree is present. Though the tree occurs naturally, occasionally Striders must go to far-flung areas of the Switchboard to plant new ones to link new settlements or establish relay stations, as well as maintain old trees to avoid parts of the network collapsing. 

> The Switchboard's functionally internet-analogue is considerably similar to ours, but for the nontrivial difference that, for the most part, the entirety of the DevitNet is conducted on hardline cable. This hardline cable being the Anarhiza also means that the entirety of the DevitNet's digital space is a mirror of the Dancirah's geographical structure. 
> The DevitNet is thus divided along lines similar to that of the Dancirah's, with cradles existing in the DevitNet that house collections of users. One of the consequences of this is that breaks in the hardline cabling can leave the corresponding geographical locale isolated from the rest of the DevitNet and thus the Switchboard, and cabling that needs to break for this to happen are usually fairly easy to locate through following the physical branch cables until they converge into large central arteries moving titanic amounts of information. 
> Thus, maintenance of the DevitNet is a tireless, unending task, undertaken by coalition forces, primarily Sil'khan and Lancasters - especially when considering the sabotage of DevitNet infrastructure is a common tactic of Vault Minds and unscrupulous parties. 

	In a truly hilarious twist - a juxtaposition if you will - Strider network administrators function more like gardeners than whatever image that title would conventionally invoke in the mind. 

#### The DevitNet Netmasters
The DevitNet's netmasters are those who've assumed net-side control of a sector or more of the DevitNet's colossal intangible real estate.

One of the quirks of the DevitNet is that it is very much constrained regionally due to its reliance on the Anarhiza. To elaborate, much of the DevitNet is a mirror of the physical Dancirah, with distance and location in the Dancirah translating almost 1 to 1 to the DevitNet. Two computers place five feet from each other are five feet apart in a sense in the DevitNet. And many, many computers say, on one region, serve to represent that region's physical presence in the Dancirah, within the DevitNet. 

As such the DevitNet is very split up, as it were, with notable locations such as cities and settlements, constructs such as nexuses and vaults, the like, all represented in the DevitNet as being equidistant from each other in that space as they are top-side. Because of this, locational and regional differences tend to arise between members of one section of the DevitNet and the other. These differences can occasionally devolve into real conflict, and usually the mediators or the instigators of this conflict are the netmasters.

By all metrics, the DevitNet's netmasters are functionally self-appointed, autonomous, and in some cases even absolute, powers. Often they establish themselves through charisma, real-world significance, or by 'right of slaughter', to describe becoming a netmaster at the expense of other netizen's wellbeing. They assume control of regions of the DevitNet and assume a number of responsibilities if they feel so inclined, such as moderating spaces and monitoring what goes through the various data highways. In particular however, netmasters are able to gain control of the various information inlets and outlets for a DevitNet region.

The Anarhiza network is setup in a manner that sees colossal nexuses of gigantic trees extend and branch out in all directions, thinning as they go along. This topology sees the various regions of the DevitNet be leaves on this tree, with only one major inlet and outlet that supplies that handles all throughput. Should a netmaster feel so inclined, they can control what passes through this central inlet, or collapse entirely for various reasons. It is one of the larger flaws of the DevitNet.

Why they may be driven to take such actions is multifarious as with anything, but core among what is observed in most who become netmasters - irrespective of means - is twofold; a nigh radiant eccentricity, and being immensely opinionated on the shape the DevitNet should take. The former drives them to assume the position. The latter compels them to take actions, either as infiltrating assassins or rampaging warlords, who seek to realize their vision of the DevitNet through any means possible.

In the net-space, they come to command a fair bit of power. So much so that it has far-reaching implications well outside the DevitNet, and many of the stories the many large bodies in the Switchboard could tell have many mentions of tangos with the netmasters in their writ.

Statistically, most netmasters are Fel-Arcad. Most arcologies double as anarhiza nexuses, thus allowing large information throughput, and the Fel-Arcad as a people are terribly sheltered and isolated, studious to a fault, and in most cases, simply quite bored. The opportunity to deal with all that in a singular fell swoop appeals to them, considering most are already well attuned to the DevitNet even at very young ages. The fact arcologies and their administration are mandated to protect the Fel-Arcad within also presents a valuable shield to any netmasters who prove particularly incendiary.

#### Maintenance
With the DevitNet being the primary means of long-distance communication in the Switchboard other than a Strider with a knapsack or a jumpship, there is an unwritten imperative that it must be maintained frequently to function optimally. It doesn't help though, that much of the DevitNet's infrastructure is incredibly traceable and accessible, and thus particularly vulnerable to those will ill intent.

The task of maintaining the DevitNet is a combined effort, often between Academy Operators and other paramilitary or simply violence-capable outfits, and the actual maintenance outfit. The latter varies. Most of the DevitNet is lacking in explicit jurisdiction, and as such Lancaster Innovations is primarily responsible to giving a little loving to anarhiza trees that need it. If a nexus is under the control of a netmaster or some other group, they often make their own arrangements for the maintenance and repair of infrastructure. It's not unheard of for 'maintenance outfits' to place listening devices or net-side saboteur tech on networks.

The need for Academy Operators or similar is due to the fact that occasionally, nexuses are hijacked by Vault Mind assets. Autonomous swarms of point-defense chromelings can easily wipe out a non-combat fleet of ships, and so it helps to have assets of one's own who are capable of imparting significant counter-force.

### The Slate
	This one I have cherished. 

The Slate is a Strider creation designed to find paths and forge new ones. In its construction a slab of pure chalk and a computational core are united to produce a device capable of speaking the languages of silicon and weave and bridging the gap between both. The Slate seeks to cover for a Strider's weaknesses and enhance their strengths. It is a digital multitool engineered to be an unparalleled sidearm for a Strider traversing the Switchboard. 

#### Construction
A Slate begins with a slab of crystalline chalk hewn from whatever larger conglomerate of crystal chalk a Strider deems fit, the origin of the slab having considerable effect on the potency of the final product. Typically, the most powerful Slates are made from slabs hewn from ancient Wellsprings, deep in their cores where some of the oldest chalk can be found, chalk that has soaked up the patterns of the entire Switchboard and matured over time. It is cut and prepared for a variety of components that will be installed to it, care being taken not to crack or shatter the slab.

The second essential component of a slate is the computational core. Developed by the Academy, these cores are artificial relics engineered to tackle both digital and weave-reliant tasks, baked in with powerful software tools. The foremost of these software tools is its operating system; the **FRONTIER Subsystems Command Matrix**, or **FRONTIER-SCM**, engineered to power Slates and responsible for coordinating their various functions. The computational core is inlaid into the chalk slab, and its vast software mind is opened to the even vaster world of the Switchboard.

The third essential component is a cutting from the Anarhiza, which facilitates the Slate's ability to communicate with other Slates and devices in the Switchboard through the DevitNet. The tree cutting feeds on ambient chalk and its branches weave into the slab, allowing it to be fed ribbon and receive it, allowing transfer of information. It is set typically in a cylindrical recess for it, cut into the Slate. 

More details on the construction of the Slate are given in a later section.

#### Functionality
The Slate serves as a Strider's sidearm on their jaunts across the Switchboard. A Strider will typically carry a relic-weapon, wield a Tek, know rituals and posses some additional powers granted by knowledge or other implements on their person. The Slate seeks to complete this - rounding out the Strider's kit - by functioning as a tool with unmatched utility. 

At its most mundane, a Slate is a computer and computers solve problems. Communication, data storage, retrieval and processing, productivity tasks and even entertainment, it helps to think of the Slate as occupying the intersection of a smartphone, laptop, supercomputer and purpose-built computers (such as the guidance computer for a smart missile system). Serving an array of purposes, the Slate is designed to be a digital Swiss-army knife; a tackler of tasks of immense shape and size. 

> As a result of the Slate's three major components in its construction, it is able to interact with chalk and the local lattice through the creation of an **artificial Five Straits** within it. This enables them to almost replicate an actual Chalkweaver in the Switchboard.

The Slate's true power emerges when used to interact with Chalk and the Switchboard. At its most elementary, for example, it can analyze a set of figures given by measuring instruments and from it, produce a viable Striding path from any two given locations in the Switchboard. Taken further, it is capable of '**deep-weave analysis**', allowing it to scan and produce information about nearly *anything* in the Switchboard - regions, relics, Teks, rituals, ongoing Structural Casts and equations, other Striders - anything. It serves as an artificial upgrade to a user's [[The Hands as Chalk#Weavesight|Weavesight]]. It can run the complex calculations a Strider may need in their chalk-weaving, and simulate fold operations to anticipate the result. It can interface with chalk rituals, serving as the interpreter for ongoing loop rituals as well as provide insight on modification and development of countermeasures, working alongside databases of information on the subject. 

In it's final form, the Slate is capable of use as a weapon, which will be elaborated upon later. 

The power of the Slate lies in bridging the chalk and the digital. It can create certainty where it was previously thought impossible. It can wrench patterns from arcane engines and charts from amorphous clouds of principles. It pulls hard numbers and gives exact information, plumbed from the murky depths of chalk complexities. While plenty of its functions can be handled by a Strider working mentally, the Slate is capable of doing that mental heavy-lifting so a Strider is free to do other things. It reduces the 'grunt-work' of appeasing Chalk's demands for use, allowing the Strider to focus on how to use the power that appeasement grants. 

#### Further Notes on Construction
Slates are the perfected manifestation of the cassette-futurism design philosophy embodied by the Switchboard's technology. They are built with portability and durability in mind, taking on an industrial, almost militaristic silhouette. Ease of repair, tactility, modularity - these things are essentials of a Slate's design. As such, Slates appear somewhat dated, seemingly a generation or so behind the touchscreen, ultra-slim, voice-activated design paradigms of today. Thick glass, hard plastic, polymers and metals, big, repairable parts; Slates are designed with the knowledge that they'll take a beating and the intention that they survive it.

Beginning with it's chalk-slab back, in size it can reach that of a regularly-sized cutting board, almost an inch thick in its thinnest sections. The FRONTIER-SCM computational core is about the size of a Raspberry Pi and typically hidden from view, as it is set inside the chalk slab. The recess for the Anarhiza cutting is set typically along the shorter side, parallel to it, often close to the very edge - much like a regular radio antenna might be set.

Most of the variation in shape and appearance of a Slate comes in the peripherals installed to complete it's construction and make it available for use. Most - at minimum - are outfitted with a keyboard, display, and tracker controller such as a nib, small ball or full-sized touchpad. Ports take high priority as means to interface with other devices and chalk constructs, often done by running chalk ribbon between it and the subject. It's very common for Striders to fly their personal jumpships by hooking up their Slates to it, which serves as the ship's computer.

Additional components are varied and up to individual Striders. Many Striders outfit theirs with a full suite of navigational tools (those listed under [[The Skywards Pursuit#Wayfinding Apparatus |wayfinding apparatus]]) and have the whole process of calculating Stride routes handled by the Slate. Strider Ritualists outfit theirs for deep ritual analysis. Combat-oriented Striders simulate the powers of their relics and Teks and use those simulations to determine the damage done to a lattice, and how better to maximize it, often installing hard-light projectors on their Slate to project human-sized targets to practice on.

	It's also worth noting how Slates are carried. Slates by design are portable, and are almost always worn on the person, facilitated by belts that allow it to be slung over the shoulder, or kept in a holster at the back or side of the body, or mounted in a quick-release system - such as held in place by a magnetic analogue. 

	Depthstriders with their power from the Void typically store their Slates in a pocket void and retreived whenever needed. Chalkstriders are not so lucky; attempting to do similar would require unfolding a Slate down to ribbon chalk, but the sheer complexity of a Slate means that the equation for folding a Slate back together is so complex as to effectively require the computational power of another slate.

Some radically alter the design and form factor of their Slate to better suit their purposes. Some who use their Slates for combat typically split it into separate modules; relocating the display modules into somewhere more practical, such as a wrist display mounted by straps or a holster, or a HUD display mounted in eye-ware over one or both eyes. 
	
	Some choose to have their Slate integrated into their lattice, their components distributed subdermally and the chalk backboard becoming the Strider's entire lattice.

#### History of Slates
The first Slates were created as a matter of necessity. Engineered by Sixth Skydancer Onuris, the Hammer, they were a response to the Vault's and Nexus' security systems as created by the First Thinkers back in the dawning Third Thinkers' Era. The discovery of the Mind's network hosted in the Vitric Shelf, the Anarhiza and how it facilitated long-distance communication between Minds, and the reverse-engineering of the internals of Chromelings led Striders to develop the first computers, and Slates are the result of integrating command over the calcic with computers.

Slates primarily were weapons. With them, they could breach the local networks maintained by Minds, disabling the shields around their various constructs, their autonomous defenses, and securing entry into the construct itself. Slates facilitated the first - and every subsequent - kache krashing operation, through their ability to breach the **Glasswall**; the phenomena engineered by Minds to isolate their command and control networks away from the wider Anarhiza root network.

Though they saw primarily utility in the conflicts against the Vault Minds then, they found themselves in the hands of anyone who benefitted from powerful, portable computing as well. Striders used them in other applications relating to chalk, navigation and even combat. They gained civilian applications as well, serving as entertainment devices, or as tools in industries.

#### The Breach Protocol
As Striders wielded the Slates, they developed new techniques and methods for contending with Minds and their constructs, as well as digital entities, mechanical constructs, and local calcic reality. In particular, a repertoire of tools was gradually developed to fight the Mind Networks, particular when it came to breaching the various flavors of Glasswall that the Vault Minds deployed to shield themselves and the Vaults from raiding parties of Striders. This ever-evolving toolbelt came to be known as the **Breach Protocol**. 

These tools and methods took on power of their own by passively becoming a doctrine themselves. The most notable of the Breach Protocol repertoires was engineered by Onuris, The Hammer himself - though this was to be much later, once the Seventh Skydancer had emerged. It was dubbed the **'PRISMpick'**, a thought-impossible chalk-glass construct deployable over a network bridge to breach Glasswalls through directed effusions of weave.

#### FRONTIER-SCM
The FRONTIER Subsystems Command Matrix is the software backbone of the Slate's computational core, designed, maintained and improved upon by the Academy. It is the spearhead of the Slate's ability to bridge Chalk and the digital. Originally, it was a software meant solely for navigation and cartography; coordinating apparatus and running calculations with variables obtained from measuring instruments - but it expanded to become a formidable software multitool capable of innumerable calcic and digital functions, particularly so when the utility of Slates in the fight against the Minds became apparent.

##### The Acronym
Taking the first letter of the various functions served by the SCM gives 'FRONTIER', as shown below;

F - Fieldwork
R - Recording
O - Observation
N - Navigation
T - Triangulation
I - Intelligence
E - Establishment
R - Referencing

	There is definitely some fluidity here on what the actual words are. Consult notebook at later date.
