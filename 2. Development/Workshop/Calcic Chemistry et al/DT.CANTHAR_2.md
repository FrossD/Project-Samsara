## Reverse Negentropy: Truth from 'Nothing'
The current model of the Switchboard's canon necessitates the ability to reverse entropy, by converting heat to motion, a principle that lies at the heart of just about every *thing* that operates in a sense in the Switchboard. It is better to call these things 'appliances', as much of this line of inquiry is for the sake of solving, in a sense, how would a blender operate in a universe without electricity.

Hex discusses the problem of negentropy, however;

>In a world where you can freely reverse entropy...
where you can turn heat into thermodynamic work...
*Is it therefore possible to form accurate beliefs without actually physically interacting with the things your beliefs are about?* 
If this is true, it would completely destroy not just encryption, but... and it's hard to explain just how devastating this would be... any sort of interaction in the world whatsoever
If someone has a secret, you don't have to be clever or conniving or threaten them with violence; there's no reason to physically interact with the person at all.
You can obtain the information. From nothing.
Calculating the answer to a problem, predicting the future, all of these things become trivial.

This is, rather obviously, a problem. It breaks much of the Switchboard's operation in manners too varied to exhaustively discuss. We do, however, have a solution.

## Neg/Entropy and Glass 4.0; Hex's Revision
Hex's proposal is that **entropy is only reversible in the Switchboard through the usage of Glass**.

We set out first with;

> Suppose that it _is_ possible to reverse entropy, but that it is 
> a) very difficult, so that it doesn't often occur in nature, and 
> b) _dangerous_, so that there's some kind of risk incurred with the mechanism that reverses entropy.

Glass solves this neatly. For one, all Glass originates from the Vitric Shelf. In the rare instances when the vitric jaws open into the Dancirah (as was weaponized by the Trinary Minds in the Praxis Conflicts described in [[The Dawn of the Dancirah]]), negentropic reactions occurring 'in nature' are still somewhat constrained by the mechanics of Glass needing a sort of **entropy threshold** to be reached before it begins negentropic destruction. 

![[Glass#Negentropy]]

For the second point - it being dangerous - that is already fairly established. Glass is *incredibly* destructive to anything that crosses this negentropy threshold. A good example is the lattice of a denizen of the Switchboard, what with all their complex weave in their complex Five Straits. Glass *devours* them, reducing them to mere chalk ribbon. It is thus thoroughly inadvisable to aim to extract information from a person using Glass, as it will far more likely just destroy their lattice utterly.

## Vitric 'Momentum'
An idea postulated by Hex, and one of inarguable genius;

>Glass builds up "**momentum**".
The essential problem is that you don't care if Glass turns the heat pumped into your house into, idk, rotational energy for a blender, even if the rotational energy is totally uniform.
If it '**overshoots**' and degrades the blender a bit (regrades the blender?) that's not a huge issue. Or maybe even you let it undershoot, so that there is some waste heat, it's not a pure conversion even if a pure conversion is possible in principle.
But imagine you willingly merge your lattice with glass in an attempt to, I don't know, peer into a Vault at a distance.
Your mind - the Chalk lattice that is essentially a Strider's brain analogue - is an incredibly delicate and sensitive piece of machinery.
You can't control the Glass enough to prevent it from '**overshooting**' its negentropy.
The more complex the thing you're trying to interact with, the more momentum the Glass builds up chewing through it, and the greater the chance that it '**overshoots**'.
And '**overshooting**' in this case would quickly reduce your computational and memory straits to pure featureless chalk.

> The danger of using Glass to reverse entropy - whether that's by turning heat into motion, or correlating your beliefs with a physical system without observing it - is that Glass builds up a sort of _momentum_; **the longer it goes on eating through something, the harder it is to slow that process down**. **The more complex the thing the Glass interacts with, the more momentum it builds up**.

This idea is profound, but strange in that it seemingly conflicts with the previously-established mechanism of **Calciphagy**; Glass feeding on chalk to propagate **more** of itself. 

The shape of the conflict is as such;
- Glass can, when controlled, be used merely to wind heat into motion. This entropy-reversal is very useful in various appliances.
- When *not* controlled, it can begin voraciously devouring all around it, turning complex weave into elementary, featureless chalk.
- Yet it also 'feeds' on this chalk, and creates more Glass as it does.

Where is this Glass coming from? Glass reduces complexity, but to an extent. By our own rules, Glass - upon encountering simple dust chalk or unwoven ribbon - should do nothing at all. An Glass feeding on unharnessed chalk will break even more things, in particular everything we want to use it for, as it would mean Glass couldn't operate by a negentropy threshold if it reduced chalk even in its simplest form.

My one solution proposition is one of **praxis mechanics**; the ability for Glass to spawn from the praxis-level warfare waged against the concept and thus doctrine of **complexity itself**. In a sense, complexity exists as a metric on astrolabic ledgers, and this metric can be depleted for glass to spawn as it destroys complex weave. A cheap solution, to be sincere, but one workable in line with the mechanics of canon.

	This part will require Hex to comment.

## Vitreodynamics; Harnessing Glass' Negentropic Effects
How is Glass used in appliances in the Switchboard?

>Glass in Switchboard appliances could be like the Americium in smoke detectors in our world.
Yes, you could in principle collect enough smoke detectors to build a dirty bomb out of them.
But the amount present in a single smoke detector is so small that you'll get a knock on your door from the feds long before you rack up enough of them to do any damage.

> Large amounts of Glass that have the potential to do damage like this are _highly_ restricted; only a very small amount is required for appliances, and taking apart all the appliances in a typical home would yield a mostly harmless amount of Glass.

This has a variety of interesting consequences across an equal variety of spectra. 

- For one, it creates an interesting canon dependence by the denizens of the Switchboard upon their ontological antithesis. They simply can't just 'ignore' the Vitric Shelf; there is tangible incentive to source glass from there to power a variety of essential appliances.

- It also creates a sort of 'controlled substance economy' where Glass is unfortunately necessary for a wide array of things, but it is also acknowledged that it is terribly dangerous when harnessed for ill-intent. As such, there are bodies dedicated to the control of the amount of glass in circulation, which in turn has resulted in a vast glass smuggling enterprise. Fertile ground for narrative.
	- The Spyndl Academy is perhaps one of the best examples of a party that is interested in monitoring and controlling the amount of glass in circulation, though I also do like the idea of a 'centralized glass authority' that is responsible for all legal distribution of glass throughout the Switchboard.

- It also simply solves one of the more annoying problems in [[Switchboard Technology]], that being how the hell shit just works in general. Coupled with the fact [[The Hands as Chalk#Hyperweave|hyperweave]] is now a thing, we actually have a tangible foundation to build upon regarding power generation, distribution and utilization in the Switchboard. A categorically colossal win. 

Hex, however, ran into an issue...
> (Aside: I will have to digest this a little further in order to check for any lingering holes or gaps. For example, a thought now occurs to me that we don't yet have a mechanism that "tells" Glass when to stop, or a means of "containing" Glass. A solution could be that Glass, like Chalk, can be manipulated via equations... hmmm...)

â€¦I fortunately already had an answer prepared;
> Not equations, but I do have a rough draft for **Vitric Ritualism**.
In the same vein as Calcic and Horizon Ritualism.
Very tiny ritualism in all appliances, using a little glass and piped heat to make magic happen.
It's downright poetry.

The Ritualism continues to prove its usefulness as a means of interacting with the harder mechanics of the world.

> As a note for the self, the foundation for the Vitric Ritualism is contained in [[Communications and Compute#The Teeth of Ryjik|the Teeth of Ryjik]] under CommsCompute. It will be necessary to transfer this over to [[Chalk Ritualism]] and make comprehensive notes.
> - Additionally, it might be time to rename the doc to merely 'Switchboard Ritualism' as it has gone far beyond the scope of only chalk.
> - A subheading for 'Alternate Ritualism' would do nicely.

## Onwards and Skywards
Hex closes with;
> What effects this has on cryptography, the learning of creasing patterns to replicate objects, digital currency, and the economy at large have yet to be explored.

## Hex's Nine Points
A response by the Doctor, in the form of nine points.

> 1. Not sure that the "threshold" concept works, we may have to sit down and examine the mechanics in more detail.

Unfortunate, but duly noted.

> 2. Hesitant to have Glass that "reproduces" by consuming chalk; it poses anthropic problems, namely, why the entire universe isn't _already_ Glass

I vote to throw in the towel on this one. Calciphagy will be amended to remove glass propagation, and instead keep merely the effects that glass has on chalk, likened to how a tear - once initially made - is hard to prevent from tearing further, and thus becomes susceptible to further tearing. Something like that.

> 3. I don't really understand how Glass operating "by praxis mechanics" is fundamentally any different from "Glass eat chalk, make more glass"

Praxis Mechanics are a power that passes power, and are - in practice - indistinguishable from authorial powers. By creating something as open-ended - as it were - as it is, it allows me to bullshit things and play fast and loose in a way that I can forgive myself for and is still conversant with canon. That being said, it really does read exactly as you put it, and thus we can bin this one.

> 4. Hyperweave is, to be frank, a bit of a mess. The resultant effects are fine, but the underlying mechanics and analogies will need a fair bit of editing.

Unfortunate #2. Added to the pile.

> 5. "It was called the PRISMpick... with a single strike, it could... undo any ritualism." This sounds incredibly broken.

'Sounds' isn't apt; it really just is. I'll make necessary amendments.

> 6. "Forging The Teeth of Ryjik is no easy task, as glass is a material that actively opposes being worked upon." This needs to be clarified further.

I was referring more so to how as a Strider, touching glass is not something you can do and get away with. Imagine trying to carve a sculpture using hand tools out of immensely radioactive rock for example, and having to take multiple-day breaks for the accumulated radiation in your body to fade before you can begin another brief session of work. You could say that the material you are working with somewhat opposes being worked on.

I will concede, though, that this could be phrased differently; 'Glass is simply difficult to work with', instead.

> 7. As an aside, I propose a challenge to the author. We are tempted to use phrases such as "Glass destroys a lattice" out of the sense that "complexity" is being "destroyed". However, this is physically inaccurate, like saying "the cold spread from the ice to their fingertips". _Cold_ doesn't spread, because "cold" is not a substance. The "substance" is _heat_, which is _sapped_ from the fingertips _by_ the _absence_ of heat in the ice. Consider the difference in impact between the phrases "the cold of the winter air spread throughout her body" and "the winter air sapped the heat from her body". Though it might certainly be a matter of taste, I prefer the latter. Likewise, I challenge you, Cryo, to find creative new ways to describe what Glass does. It does not have "destructive potential". "Destruction" is entropic; Glass does not destroy. It orders, it organizes, it sifts. Glass cleans. Glass purifies. Glass sorts. Glass fixes the brokenness and disarray of the universe.

An interesting proposition. I will keep it in mind.

> 8. Glasswire needs a rewrite to be compatible with the new glass/chalk dynamics; _or_ we need to tweak Glass mechanics to accommodate how Glasswire currently works.

Unfortunate #3, but less so.

I am glad you read CommsCompute. I am interested to hear your take on its entirety. Most of all, perhaps, is that I am glad you take issue with how glasswire works, even if only because revisions elsewhere have forced our hands. 

In all sincerity, glasswire's foundational principles suffer from what I can only describe as 'gross inelegance'. It just isn't pretty, per se. It feels like the way I'd do things, and perhaps the way things would and maybe even *should* work in Samsara, but I am not pleased with it and it is difficult being displeased with it on what is arguably a motif basis because I make the argument to myself that it is primarily the macroscopic elements of CommsCompute that make it into the actual narrative canon, and thus glasswire can - and perhaps even *should* - be ugly if it means everything else is functional and neat.

We will have to revise this one too either way. I will prefer, though, that whatever comes out the other side is more to my tastes.

> 9. What turns motion into heat? Nothing. It simply _does_. I feel the desire for an answer here stems from a misconception. For example, suppose I asked you "what makes things fall down?" and you answered "gravity". What's actually happening here? You could say that the word "gravity" is merely a label for a set of phenomena, namely the things-fall-down-set; in which case, if we taboo the word "gravity" and replace it with its meaning, we get "things fall down because of the things-fall-down-phenomena". Similarly, we might notice that "gravity", as a word, is an empty model. It provides no predictions. It doesn't tell you how _fast_ things fall down, when they fall and when they don't, etc. It is not useful. The _true answer_ to "what makes things fall down" is just: they do, and we simply observe _that they do_. We can describe _how_ they fall down in more detail, specify the conditions, establish patterns of what things fall down when and how fast, but there is no "why". It simply is. Likewise, motion simply _does_ disperse over time into what we perceive physiologically as "heat". We can specify in more detail under what circumstances motion does this, at what rate the motion degrades, etc. But there is no "why".

Music to my ears. Stars bless you.

## Work
Assuming the following problems are fixed;
- ~~Where does Heat come from as regards its state as 'dispersed' motive weave?~~
	- Nothing needs to do anything for motion to disperse as heat. It just does.

- ~~Does Calciphagy or Glass Momentum or some amalgamated form of both accurately describe the negentropic reaction glass has?~~
	- Glass momentum.

Then we can revise the following docs according;
[[Switchboard Technology]]
- The section on electricity and power generation gets updated into a more generic-appearing but far more canon-compliant **Power Generation, Distribution and Utilization**.
	- Under **Generation**, we describe the various sources of chalk that exist in the Switchboard and how they are harnessed on an industrial scale.
	- Under **Distribution**, we describe how hyperweave is used to move ultra-dense chalk over long distances, and how - by some mechanism - it becomes heat at various distribution substations, that in turn move it through various solid media.
	- Under **Utilization**, we describe how appliances in the Switchboard harness the negentropic ability of glass to reverse entropy and turn heat into motion, serving as the basis for the functioning of many of the Switchboard's appliances.
		- We also discuss the narrative or in-universe consequences that arise from something as destructive as glass being essential for day-to-day operation within the Switchboard.

[[Glass]]
- **Glass 4.0**; which will primarily be a revision that discusses;
	- How glass propagates through negentropic reactions.
	- How glass reverses entropy and thus this gives it various applications.
	- The **threshold concept** that dictates how glass affects some weave and not others is in need of discussion.
		- Though I must ask Hex for clarification on where exactly lies the problem.
	- Amendment to Calciphagy to detail how glass doesn't replicate itself as it damages lattice. The docs that'll need changing on this front are;
		- [[Communications and Compute]]
		- [[The EPIT]]
	- Devise a 'language of glass' to replace and account for the nature of glass as something that *simplifies* and *perfects* rather than destroys.

[[Calcodynamics]]
- This doc will simply be complete at all, and many of its sections will be linked into other docs to explain how the foundational mechanics outlined here are used and built upon elsewhere. Examples of such are;
	- Inductive weave explaining **Inductive Damage** in  [[On Weave and Warfare]]
	- Property weaves being used in [[Chalk Ritualism]]

- Far more to come regarding harnessing the mechanics developed here to solve the larger encryption and currency problem that exists within the canon.

**Hyperweave** - under [[The Hands as Chalk]]
- Underlying mechanic need a second pass.
