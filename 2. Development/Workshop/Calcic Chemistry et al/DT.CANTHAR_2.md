## Reverse Negentropy: Truth from 'Nothing'
The current model of the Switchboard's canon necessitates the ability to reverse entropy, by converting heat to motion, a principle that lies at the heart of just about every *thing* that operates in a sense in the Switchboard. It is better to call these things 'appliances', as much of this line of inquiry is for the sake of solving, in a sense, how would a blender operate in a universe without electricity.

Hex discusses the problem of negentropy, however;

>In a world where you can freely reverse entropy...
where you can turn heat into thermodynamic work...
*Is it therefore possible to form accurate beliefs without actually physically interacting with the things your beliefs are about?* 
If this is true, it would completely destroy not just encryption, but... and it's hard to explain just how devastating this would be... any sort of interaction in the world whatsoever
If someone has a secret, you don't have to be clever or conniving or threaten them with violence; there's no reason to physically interact with the person at all.
You can obtain the information. From nothing.
Calculating the answer to a problem, predicting the future, all of these things become trivial.

This is, rather obviously, a problem. It breaks much of the Switchboard's operation in manners too varied to exhaustively discuss. We do, however, have a solution.

## Neg/Entropy and Glass 4.0; Hex's Revision
Hex's proposal is that **entropy is only reversible in the Switchboard through the usage of Glass**.

We set out first with;

> Suppose that it _is_ possible to reverse entropy, but that it is 
> a) very difficult, so that it doesn't often occur in nature, and 
> b) _dangerous_, so that there's some kind of risk incurred with the mechanism that reverses entropy.

Glass solves this neatly. For one, all Glass originates from the Vitric Shelf. In the rare instances when the vitric jaws open into the Dancirah (as was weaponized by the Trinary Minds in the Praxis Conflicts described in [[The Dawn of the Dancirah]]), negentropic reactions occurring 'in nature' are still somewhat constrained by the mechanics of Glass needing a sort of **entropy threshold** to be reached before it begins negentropic destruction. 

![[Glass#Negentropy]]

For the second point - it being dangerous - that is already fairly established. Glass is *incredibly* destructive to anything that crosses this negentropy threshold. A good example is the lattice of a denizen of the Switchboard, what with all their complex weave in their complex Five Straits. Glass *devours* them, reducing them to mere chalk ribbon. It is thus thoroughly inadvisable to aim to extract information from a person using Glass, as it will far more likely just destroy their lattice utterly.

## Vitric 'Momentum'
An idea postulated by Hex, and one of inarguable genius;

>Glass builds up "**momentum**".
The essential problem is that you don't care if Glass turns the heat pumped into your house into, idk, rotational energy for a blender, even if the rotational energy is totally uniform.
If it '**overshoots**' and degrades the blender a bit (regrades the blender?) that's not a huge issue. Or maybe even you let it undershoot, so that there is some waste heat, it's not a pure conversion even if a pure conversion is possible in principle.
But imagine you willingly merge your lattice with glass in an attempt to, I don't know, peer into a Vault at a distance.
Your mind - the Chalk lattice that is essentially a Strider's brain analogue - is an incredibly delicate and sensitive piece of machinery.
You can't control the Glass enough to prevent it from '**overshooting**' its negentropy.
The more complex the thing you're trying to interact with, the more momentum the Glass builds up chewing through it, and the greater the chance that it '**overshoots**'.
And '**overshooting**' in this case would quickly reduce your computational and memory straits to pure featureless chalk.

> The danger of using Glass to reverse entropy - whether that's by turning heat into motion, or correlating your beliefs with a physical system without observing it - is that Glass builds up a sort of _momentum_; **the longer it goes on eating through something, the harder it is to slow that process down**. **The more complex the thing the Glass interacts with, the more momentum it builds up**.

This idea is profound, but strange in that it seemingly conflicts with the previously-established mechanism of **Calciphagy**; Glass feeding on chalk to propagate **more** of itself. 

The shape of the conflict is as such;
- Glass can, when controlled, be used merely to wind heat into motion. This entropy-reversal is very useful in various appliances.
- When *not* controlled, it can begin voraciously devouring all around it, turning complex weave into elementary, featureless chalk.
- Yet it also 'feeds' on this chalk, and creates more Glass as it does.

Where is this Glass coming from? Glass reduces complexity, but to an extent. By our own rules, Glass - upon encountering simple dust chalk or unwoven ribbon - should do nothing at all. An Glass feeding on unharnessed chalk will break even more things, in particular everything we want to use it for, as it would mean Glass couldn't operate by a negentropy threshold if it reduced chalk even in its simplest form.

My one solution proposition is one of **praxis mechanics**; the ability for Glass to spawn from the praxis-level warfare waged against the concept and thus doctrine of **complexity itself**. In a sense, complexity exists as a metric on astrolabic ledgers, and this metric can be depleted for glass to spawn as it destroys complex weave. A cheap solution, to be sincere, but one workable in line with the mechanics of canon.

	This part will require Hex to comment.

## Vitreodynamics; Harnessing Glass' Negentropic Effects
How is Glass used in appliances in the Switchboard?

>Glass in Switchboard appliances could be like the Americium in smoke detectors in our world.
Yes, you could in principle collect enough smoke detectors to build a dirty bomb out of them.
But the amount present in a single smoke detector is so small that you'll get a knock on your door from the feds long before you rack up enough of them to do any damage.

> Large amounts of Glass that have the potential to do damage like this are _highly_ restricted; only a very small amount is required for appliances, and taking apart all the appliances in a typical home would yield a mostly harmless amount of Glass.

This has a variety of interesting consequences across an equal variety of spectra. 

- For one, it creates an interesting canon dependence by the denizens of the Switchboard upon their ontological antithesis. They simply can't just 'ignore' the Vitric Shelf; there is tangible incentive to source glass from there to power a variety of essential appliances.

- It also creates a sort of 'controlled substance economy' where Glass is unfortunately necessary for a wide array of things, but it is also acknowledged that it is terribly dangerous when harnessed for ill-intent. As such, there are bodies dedicated to the control of the amount of glass in circulation, which in turn has resulted in a vast glass smuggling enterprise. Fertile ground for narrative.
	- The Spyndl Academy is perhaps one of the best examples of a party that is interested in monitoring and controlling the amount of glass in circulation, though I also do like the idea of a 'centralized glass authority' that is responsible for all legal distribution of glass throughout the Switchboard.

- It also simply solves one of the more annoying problems in [[Switchboard Technology]], that being how the hell shit just works in general. Coupled with the fact [[The Hands as Chalk#Hyperweave|hyperweave]] is now a thing, we actually have a tangible foundation to build upon regarding power generation, distribution and utilization in the Switchboard. A categorically colossal win. 

Hex, however, ran into an issue...
> (Aside: I will have to digest this a little further in order to check for any lingering holes or gaps. For example, a thought now occurs to me that we don't yet have a mechanism that "tells" Glass when to stop, or a means of "containing" Glass. A solution could be that Glass, like Chalk, can be manipulated via equations... hmmm...)

â€¦I fortunately already had an answer prepared;
> Not equations, but I do have a rough draft for **Vitric Ritualism**.
In the same vein as Calcic and Horizon Ritualism.
Very tiny ritualism in all appliances, using a little glass and piped heat to make magic happen.
It's downright poetry.

The Ritualism continues to prove its usefulness as a means of interacting with the harder mechanics of the world.

> As a note for the self, the foundation for the Vitric Ritualism is contained in [[Communications and Compute#The Teeth of Ryjik|the Teeth of Ryjik]] under CommsCompute. It will be necessary to transfer this over to [[Chalk Ritualism]] and make comprehensive notes.
> - Additionally, it might be time to rename the doc to merely 'Switchboard Ritualism' as it has gone far beyond the scope of only chalk.
> - A subheading for 'Alternate Ritualism' would do nicely.

## Onwards and Skywards
Hex closes with;
> What effects this has on cryptography, the learning of creasing patterns to replicate objects, digital currency, and the economy at large have yet to be explored.
