**Motion and Motive Weave**
- Motion is, and has to be, weave.
- Motion is additionally inductive weave; bumping into things transfers motive weave to a final pattern at the expense of it in the initial pattern.
- Motive weave can in principle be extracted from anything, though usually it is fleeting as it transfers itself from pattern to pattern.
- Motive power/weave is supposedly the final form of all weaves, which is why it can be extracted from food.
> ~~Unsure what the food point has to do with it.~~ Unsure what the food point has to do with it being the final form of all weaves, but I do grasp how food and it's property weave convert well into motive weave.
- You can deplete property weaves to make motive weaves, but doing so in reverse is prohibitively difficult.
> As my own note, this part makes sense in that food that is the most 'energy giving' (or yields the most motive weave) is thus food with the most properties, meaning the energy (motive weave) given by food scales with things such as number of ingredients and tastiness, which is mildly amusing.
> As regards the part where it is prohibitively difficult, I believe that is the domain of **potentia**.

**Aside**
- Different materials (patterns), when frozen, burned, crushed, mixed, separated, extract useful weaves, like hardness or luster.
>Unsure of this; primarily the chalk ritualism is used to extract weave from pattern. These processes however, can **forge** property weave naturally, but not extract it for use.

**Potentia**
- Motive weave also exists as 'potentia'.
- Potentia can supposedly be extracted from property weave such as hardness, converting it to motive weave and leaving the hard material soft.
>Is that then (using arbitrary numbers for the 'amount' of hardness weave);
> Hard. W. * 100 = Potentia + Motive Weave + Hard. W. * 75
> ?
- Potentia is a bridge between property weaves (?).
- Turning motive weave directly into hardness weave is more difficult, and thus this potentia needs to be the bridge.
- >"It would be like... using the chemical energy of a battery, to drive a motor, to push walls to compress a material."
> Not sure if I grasp this example.
- "You can't just weave motion back into hardness, you have to actually use the motion up at the physical level."
> - Not sure I totally grasp this either. Does 'using up the motion here' mean that, if this were not the case, there would be a means to throw a cotton ball through the air and as it flew, it would lose velocity faster than should be the case but in return, would become harder? 
> - Is this a case of reversing the equation above instead where;
> Motive Weave =/= Hard. W.
> because the potentia is missing?
> - I'm not entirely sure I grasp specifically what potentia is either now that I think about it.

**Inductive Weave**
- Sweeping declaration of inductive weave having some faults to begin with.
> Expected, of course.
- Going into heat, heat can turn hard weave into 'soft weave'...
> As a note, soft weave doesn't necessarily exist, and is rather simple the absence of hard weave. Whether this rule can apply to all properties with opposites (that is, all of them) remains to be seen.
- Heat isn't its own weave, and is rather just motive weave that **disperses its motion**.
> So if I understand correctly;
> - **Motive Weave**: Inductive weave that moves from pattern to pattern in a 'depletionary' manner, in which the presence of motive weave in B is a result of its depletion in A.
> - '**Heat**' **Motive Weave**: Inductive weave that say, instead of depleting itself from A to go to B due to contact, it exists in a constant state of depleting its presence in A to 'enter' B, C, D... in the vicinity?

**More on Heat**
- There is a means to 'tell' motive weave to 'become' or disperse as heat.
> Do things in the Switchboard get hot when they slow down? Perhaps it's some kind of built-in air resistance analogue?
- There is also a means (again, operative word being 'telling') to turn heat back into motion.
- In a bid to eliminate electricity from the equation (or maybe not explicitly to 'eliminate' it but rather to solve the worldbuilding problems associated with it) we theorize a means of the Switchboard's 'powered' apparatus using heat instead of electricity. Metal pipes which still retain their ability to more efficiently conduct heat - as well as engineered relic and metamaterials which can do so even more efficiently - can be used to 'pipe' heat and turn it into motion at the 'other end'. 
- To preemptively solve the problem that comes with a hypothetical junction box of wires being so hot as to warp the surrounding air, engineered metamaterials that abjectly reject heat are used as wire insulation.
> I think this works. We just need to theorycraft how exactly motion replaces electricity in certain equipment. Are Switchboard computers powered by heat as well? There is some 'thing' that needs to bridge this idea that I can pipe heat into a box and a screen on the side turns on. More discussion needed.

**Lightning**
>Lightning... exists. In some modified capacity that comes with analysis of it as a force of heat and motion to be compatible with our model. Without exactly being able to tell you what 'it' is, I believe it works.
>

**Magnetism**
> Gone.

**Light**
- Light and radio waves unfortunately have to exist due to the sheer complexity of it as a phenomena. 
- By extension, transmission of information over long distances is also possible. We just need an in-universe reason why no one does this.
> Hex's suggestion is that the DevitNet is simply so good at what it does that people simply never explored alternatives. This absolutely does work, but I want more; a more solid reason why the DevitNet is used over radio waves. My first take is that the DevitNet works... better? because it operates on and using calcic principles and chalk. Also the fact the DevitNet is the only means to engage the Vault Minds.
> As a truly insane idea though, maybe denizens of the Switchboard use both simultaneously for different reasons. Perhaps Vault Minds can't view radio wave transmissions, and so they aren't able to eavesdrop on kache krashing teams and their operations. Something like that. I am unsure.
- Of course, our woes concerning light still exist in the form of how it's produced and absorbed in the absence of electromagnetism.
> Might be something we can do here along the lines of 'color' property weave. Remains to be seen and discussed.
