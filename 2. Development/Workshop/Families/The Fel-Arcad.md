# The Fel-Arcad
Hailing from the arcadia-seated arcologies throughout the Switchboard are the Fel-Arcad, one of the oldest houses and descendants of great Weavers of chalk. Their Curlicue states their tri-fold charge; harmonious living-dialogue with the arcadia, attainment of the perfect weave-semblance, and the path to both needing walking by any and all means.

### Snap Thoughts
Spur of the moment thoughts that could use work.

- Whether the Vahnkin and the Void would actually be responsible for a Second Refrain and if they were responsible for the first one is possible, but disputed. In actuality, many Fel-Arcad, unable to accept the possibility they shot themselves in the foot with the Mind Hunts, choose instead to blame the Void and the Vahnkin.
- History and Mythology section has notable persons in it.
	- Fel-Arcad originator of cinema.
- Add 'Individuals' to #07.

## STRATA ONE
### 01. Doctrine
I think a functional baseline for the Fel-Arcad would be the ideological movement of **transhumanism** and working from there. Transhumanism is the belief that the limits of the human body can be transcended via technology, and it's something I've looked into quite a lot. My interest in it arose around the time I began losing my Christianity, and 'shopped' for what might serve as something preferable if not superior to latch on to. In a strange way the transhumanist's desire to be more than themselves isn't that much different from the Christian's is it? It's a debate for another time.

A lot of things converged to synthesize the Fel-Arcad. There was the idea of the lofty, learned, isolated thinkers who spent their days seeking higher truths rather than surviving against harsh elements and the like. And so there needed to be some higher truth to pursue. There's a school of thought for transhumanists that feels that **aesthetic modifications of our persons will help us reach versions of our physical forms that best mirror how we see ourselves inwardly, and that this will lead to positive outcomes mentally**. And so I played around with the idea of Information Tangibility being a way to **modify your own lattice**; you sequence your strings and find what decides your eye color, and you change it. And thus, **you become truer to yourself**.

Inevitably I pondered what the limits would be. Okay, I can change my eye color, what about hair? Sure. Skin color? Controversial, but yes. Alright, can I grow horns? Sharpen my teeth? Sprout wings? Get extra fingers? And then I think to myself, this is rather nifty, I can probably do something rather interesting with this.

Caves of Qud is what realigned my thinking in that way. I credit it for a lot of things relating to the Fel-Arcad and Samsara in general. In CoQ, it's a common game mechanic that sometimes, **some problems are solved by growing wings, or a tail, or extra arms or legs**. And these are significant problems too, made so by the game being immensely punishing. **You simply cannot cling to 'body purism'**, as it were, and succeed as effectively as you would if you simply forego that manner of thinking. And while I myself will really only grow wings and a tail and maybe extra arms, I can escape the constraints of my irrational discomfort long enough to ponder the idea of **an entire doctrine developed around the idea of taking matters of the physical self - aggressively - into one's own hands**.

There was also a more personal confrontation that I have and still do face periodically, and perhaps it's the one most pivotal to the making of the Fel-Arcad, but that one is for a better iteration of me to make public.

So what then is the Fel-Arcad's doctrine? All of the thinking above is compressed into a single NarratWB concept; [[On Birthing and Being#On Shape|The Lattice as a Canvas]]. It describes how the mechanics of chalk allows for **bypassing all the annoying things such as biology that keeps us and our vision of - and I loathe having to use this example - genetically engineered cat-girls**. Chalk at its core lets you play fast and loose with the natural sciences; you can bridge things and cross gaps that you really shouldn't be able to. The entire system of chalk is like being a deliberate C-student - just doing enough to get by - and having that mentality somehow being enough to enable you to toss fireballs or hack Wi-Fi trees and other things.

Or in this case, grow horns. 

And so the Fel-Arcad's doctrine is, **why be what you are when you could be what you want to be?** That's what the Sembleworks is - a place where you can **become what you want**. The Loom and the Lathe - the original ones anyway - are destroyed, but lesser ones housing mere fragments of their arcane power exist, and their sufficient enough to realize dreams of yours short of the recreation of your entire lattice. That is to say, the only thing they can't do is build something that is both wholly different from what it started with and is yet still you, which isn't so terrible a limitation no?

And so the Fel-Arcad are the Switchboard's 'weird people'. They're easy to spot because they're different, visibly so - glaringly even - and perhaps it can be a narrative point that that makes others in the Switchboard not understanding of such doctrine mildly uncomfortable as people are wont to do. And it could be a reason why they are so cooped up in their utopic arcologies, where science and chalk have united to create unparalleled living conditions such that the Fel-Arcad are plagued with nothing except the desire to know and the desire to be. And that's what it comes down to - **what are the ways of *being*?** Are there correct and wrong ones? Am I even eligible to speak on the topic? I can only ponder it from the perspective of what I'd like to learn about these people if I were an archaeologist digging through their ruins millennia later. 

But I feel it's worth exploring nonetheless. Of course, some Fel-Arcad disagree with this doctrine, and I will be tasked with developing reasons why. The fear of difference goes a long way though, as we can see even in our world today, but we cannot have the 'opposition' be wholly, inarguably irrational as that will make for poor storytelling. But I feel I've gotten what I consider to be their doctrine across as well as I feel I could.

### 02. Chalk Affinity
This one is fairly straightforward, but still rather interesting. I designed the PFam using a litany of parameters and arranging them on spectra that sought to differentiate each family from one another. One of this was chalk affinity and I read it in two ways; actual proficiency with chalk - as in [[The Hands as Chalk]] - and proficiency with the Strider Protocol.

For the Fel-Arcad I chose to make them powerful chalk*weavers* but not particularly notable chalk*striders*. The reason for this is in their Yarn; **the Fel-Arcad don't go outside**. Their arcologies are simply better than most places you could go to so long as your judgement criteria was the living experience within them. People come *to* the Fel-Arcad and trade the vast bounty of the Switchboard for the knowledge obtained by the Fel-Arcad from their study of the sack of odds and ends you brought last time. **Arcology living has made them disinclined to seeing the sights**, as it were, and so they had no real reason to become particularly adept at the Strider Protocol.

As chalkweavers however? Canonically second to none. 

So how do they use their chalk? The easiest way to answer the question is to ponder the concept of Calcodynamics or 'chalk in motion'. In-canon, you use chalk for many things, but most common and straightforward is that of combat, where you must weave chalk frequently, precisely and with an insistence on delivering results. 

However, the Fel-Arcad rarely have cause to fight as - mentioned before - they don't go outside, and because they take a scholarly approach to chalk and its interactions, **they are prone to using chalk in ways that are slow, deliberate, require planning and preparation and aligning parameters perfectly, but boast considerable results**. Think charged attacks and high-cooldown abilities. 

The Fel-Arcad play like mages; **they forgo the fast, easy powers of weaving constructs and implements, teks and relics and focus wholly on using rituals to fight**. Their logic is, okay, a tek lets you throw fire, but they'd much rather draw concentric circles and intersecting triangles and place candles on every vertex and a flower at the center to call down a meteor. Theirs' is power through complexity, as it were - a bomb over a sword.

## STRATA TWO
### 03. History & Mythology
#### The History of the Fel-Arcad
**They That Fell #1 - Origins of the Fel-Arcad**
The Fel-Arcad - though not bearing this name at the time - arose alongside the other Third Kin after the Astrolabe's resolution of its celestial calculus in the aftermath of the First Praxis War. Around this time, though before their rise from chalk, the astrolabic regions arose, and the **Arcad** as they would come to be called arose on the astrolabic region **Rosenthal**. Along with them and the other Third Kin was the Strider and Weave Protocols, which arose in tandem, and the Arcad were gifted particularly with command over chalk through weaving. They gained the power to interact with the Switchboard at its core foundations; the ribbon level.

As they settled in Rosenthal, its regional equation led to it growing and becoming a lush, verdant **arcadia**, in every sense an Eden-like paradise. Its unparalleled aesthetic qualities was greatly endearing to the Arcad, and it was perhaps the first thing after their proficiency with the Weave Protocol that began shaping what would be their doctrine and various philosophies. With their growing command of weave they tended to their pristine home and grew it further, the entire region becoming a verdant marble sphere in the Dancirah's sky.

From the Arcad arose various figures who even among the gifted, were further gifted, and among them was **Arcad Rosen**. Rosen was many things, but chief among them was a scholar, artist and builder. As the Arcad multiplied through the Ritual of Conjugation and conventional means (though preferring the Conjugation due to what they observed in plant life around them), Rosen set about inspiring the Arcad with his ideas of what they could become, making various writings and plans for realizing this. Further pursuits into the science and arts saw one of his ideas in particular grow in prominence; that of an Arcad domicile that would be home to all Arcad on Rosenthal, a central structure that - unlike the inert habitations they dwelt in - would grow as they did, living in harmony with the world around it. He dubbed this the **arcology**.

The **First Arcology at Rosenthal** or simply the First Arcology is the moment at which all there is to the Fel-Arcad converge and diverge. It is a unifying point in their canon from which all they became and will become originate. Designed by Arcad Rosen and built by the most skilled of chalkweavers at the time, the First Arcology was knitted into existence as a living, breathing thing that grew tall and wide, aged in a manner like them, and *learned* in a manner like them. At its center was the first Fey Curlicue, the result of a ritual carried out by Rosen to create a living record of their people. From the first Fey Curlicue were seeds obtained, and these would be used to set up more daughter arcologies in the regions near the Astrolabe.

Within the near-utopic conditions of their new home, the Arcad were free to pursue all that their hearts desired, plunging deeper into the sciences, arts and philosophies, studying all they had gleaned from the events from before they and the Third Kin arose and building the Dancirah's first compendiums of knowledge. Content with staying in their almost perfect living conditions within the First Arcology, they were disinclined towards exploring the wider Switchboard, even those with the Strider Protocol, and were far more interested in studying and making sense of the various oddities brought to them by others who had launched out into the Dancirah, particularly the Danseers - gifted in the Strider Protocol - who began aggressively venturing out to make meaning of their and all of the Third Kin's existence.

There did the Arcad dwell in peace and harmony, engaging in studies and leisure, until they and all the Third Kin were dragged into the Switchboard's largest conflict of old; a battle to earn their right to exist.

**They That Fell #2 - In the Eyes of the Minds**
The First Thinkers - the Minds - took note of the Third Kin soon enough, and at realizing what they were, were incensed and set about plotting how to annihilate them as they did the Vermeil. The First Thinkers created the Vitric Minds, and their command over Glass allowed for the deployment of jaws throughout the Dancirah. Daughter arcologies began to fall, and the Arcad were terrorized throughout the Switchboard, many choosing to return to the First Arcology for protection, after it became apparent that whatever weapon the Minds were using against them seemingly couldn't be deployed against the arcology at Rosenthal.

> They would later learn it was due to the Minds fearing they would damage the Astrolabe due to the close proximity of the Rosenthal astrolabic region, and doom the existence of the Switchboard as a whole, a risk too great to take.

With the enemy invisible and their weapon impossibly deadly, extinction seemed imminent. But it was at this time that the Weave Divisive who had gone into hiding after the events of the First Praxis War reemerged, seeing the power of the Third Kin and fearing a repeat of the Vermeil. They came to the Arcad first, seeing them as the most likely to heed their words, and informed them of the shape and nature of their enemy. 

With this, the Arcad and Third Kin at large realized that should they wish to survive in the Dancirah, they would have to fight, and to fight they would have to be a singular, united force with one charge, under one banner; a single sword, pointed starwards. Alongside the Danseers and members of the other families, they formed the **Spyndl Academy**, an institution of both scholarship and warfare that would concoct a means to oppose the Eradication Imperative.

With their unrivalled command over chalk and weave, the Arcad set about utilizing their vast study and research into equipping the Academy's operatives to fight the Minds. The Arcad were the ones who learned the necessity of killing a Mind within their domain such as a Vault or Nexus, learned how to reverse-engineer the Chromeling machine-life that served the Vaults, and from it engineer the computers that had previously been thought lost with the Vermeil, and then, the first Slates, their means of breaching the Vaults. With their skills in the calcic ritualism as well as botany, they learned to use the Anarhiza tree that populated the Switchboard, and build the Dendro-Vitric Root Network - the DevitNet - that allowed for long-distance communication throughout the Switchboard, as well as their means of breaching the Vaults and contending with the Vault Minds.

> Relevant reading; [[The Dawn of the Dancirah#The First Offensive |The First Offensive]] - [[The Dawn of the Dancirah#The Second Offensive The First Kache Krash|The Second Offensive]]. 

This invaluable study led to the first successful breach of a Vault, and defeat of the Interdiction Mind that governed it, with the plundering of Vermeil artifacts providing an all-new wealth of knowledge to the Arcad and the Spyndl Academy. With this, they were put inescapably on a path to the Second Praxis War.

**They That Fell #3 - Off to War and Back Again**
As powerful Weavers and Ritualists, the Fel-Arcad played a considerable role in the open conflict with the Minds, their command over chalk being a new variable the Minds could not contend with easily, and their usage of rituals truly being a tall order for the Minds as they seemed almost astrolabic in nature. The Minds were defeated and pushed back on front after front, Danseer Striders and Arcad Weavers leading at the tip of the spear.

When they gleaned that the Vitric Minds were hidden in the Vitric Shelf, it was the Arcad who devised the schema for the structural cast that would birth a weapon capable of defeating Glass, as well as executing the cast itself while the Danseers and other Academy forces protected them. The birth of Skydancer Ryjik was all they needed to finally stage a raid on the Vitric Shelf and the Trinary Complex that housed the Minds orchestrating the entire offensive.

And so they went, and were victorious, in perhaps the grandest, most difficult, and most important Kache Krashing operation ever carried out. They wholly crushed the Vitric Minds.

In a final move that would mark one of the rare moments of the Arcad being motivated by baser things innate to thinking beings, the Arcad set about personally creating the being that was the Eighth Skydancer - Morrigan the Mindflayer - using a device seized from the Trinary Complex. Morrigan was engineered with the Arcad's desire for revenge for the arcologies lost to the First Kin, and Morrigan would be their weapon for enacting this revenge, something she and others in tow would come to do in the fifth and final distinct offensive - the Mind Hunts.

At the end of the war, they settled into a role in the Spyndl Academy as their scholars, studying the Switchboard and chalk and using what they gleaned both to empower the Spyndl Academy and their peoples as a whole, ushering in a new era; the Era of the Third Kin.

> Relevant reading; [[The Dawn of the Dancirah#The Second Praxis War|The Second Praxis War]] - [[The Dawn of the Dancirah#New Charges|New Charges]].

**They That Fell #4 - The Mind Hunts**
The Danseers were indeed the Switchboard's finest Striders, but they did not possess the hatred for the Minds that the Arcad did. The Danseers were more so nomads than builders, and while the Danseers did lose plenty in the Second Praxis War and the conflicts that built up to it, they did not lose to the degree that the Arcad did; their arcologies, arts and kin. It was with this fiery anger that the Fel-Arcad followed the nigh-gods they had built in the shapes of Morrigan the Flayer and Ryjik the Eater into the Mind Hunts, a final offensive against the First Thinkers to satisfy the Arcad's thirst for revenge.

And they were successful - perhaps even too successful - as their hunt of all Minds including the elimination of even the Overseer Adamant, a faction of First Thinkers that had remained neutral in all the conflicts, dedicated merely towards serving the Astrolabe. In a move reminiscent of salting the fields even after burning the crop, they were all eliminated under the Arcad's burning wrath, and many would conclude this was a fatal error, based on the various studies that showed the presence of the Overseer Adamant might've prevented the catastrophe to come.

But the deed was done all the same, and without a being left in the cosmos to oppose them, the Arcad returned to their arcologies to repair and rebuild. They joined the others in celebration, but were far more content to simply return to the only homes they had known. They lived in peace.

For a while.

> Relevant reading; [[The Dawn of the Dancirah#The Fifth Offensive The Mind Hunts|The Mind Hunts]].

**They That Fell #5 - The Refrain**
The Refrain struck, and the Arcad fell.

All of the Third Kin did in some regard, but the Fel-Arcad were hit particularly terribly. The storms of calcic calculus bombarded Rosenthal with the force of dying stars, and the sphere along with all other astrolabic regions were torn to shreds, reduced to merely a halo of chalk and debris orbiting the Astrolabe. In this catastrophe, the the First Arcadia and the First Arcology that sat in it, the first true home of the Arcad, was destroyed, ground to dust for use in the Astrolabe's calculations. Arcad Rosen is believed to have been lost in the storms, along with a vast swathe of the Arcad population, all they had built and stored on Rosenthal in the First Arcology, and numerous losses were recorded on nearly every daughter arcology out in the Dancirah.

It was a catastrophic loss, the likes of which escaped conception of even the Arcad's most doom-minded scholars. Their home region annihilated, the few Arcad not living upon it and those who managed to escape before the storm hit were all that were left of Arcad Third Kin. Those that could stride made up the majority of those who left in time on the day the Refrain struck, with others unable to due to being out of practice, or were unable to board evacuation vessels making up the vast majority of Arcad causalities. Those that escaped ventured far and deep into the Switchboard, groups of Arcad suddenly forced to fly on unfamiliar wings, going out in a Switchboard battered and bleeding, and filled with threats they had only dealt with in the pages of books of scholarly papers. 

It was around this time that the **Ledger of the Lost** was collated, drawing from accounts and records given by various Arcad of those who had been lost. Many copies existed, as it was nigh impossible to confirm if someone was dead or had escaped to some distant corner of the Switchboard.

The Arcad lost the most in the Refrain, and were forced into a nomadic phase of their history, where they as a people wandered the hostile, shattered stars looking for how they could rebuild themselves. It is the darkest era in their canon, and they came to be known as the **_Fel_-Arcad**; those who had fallen from the arcadia and the arcology they once called home.

**They That Fell #6 - The Nomadic Period**
The Fel-Arcad fled the wreckage of their old home on a thousand different trajectories, boarding ships or striding where they could as the tried to escape the now treacherous region around the Astrolabe that surged with lacerating chalk. Many died before the Refrain even hit, as the currents of chalk hit distant arcologies far from the Astrolabe and Rosenthal. More than could be counted died on the day it struck proper. And plenty more perished as they fled, falling victim to the various treacheries of the Great Sky, ranging from flux storms to active Vaults to even bands of Third Kin looking to loot the fleeing stragglers. 

But some managed to escape, crash-landing on distant, often unexplored regions in Cradles untouched by Third Kin. They looked up to the Great Sky above and down to their meager belongings and were stricken with the ordeal that awaited them. The greatest consequence of the arcologies - a criticism levelled against them to this day - was that the Fel-Arcad were wholly unprepared for the Switchboard when it was red in tooth and claw. Sheltered and cared for in their pristine domiciles, even as they had dealings with the Danseers and other families, even as they studied them and what they brought to the Fel-Arcad's various schools, never had they learned how to deal with the Switchboard themselves, and many more Fel-Arcad perished from harsh environmental conditions, opportunistic folks made sharp and wicked by the Refrain, and some who simply lost the will to fight, lying down and waiting for death to take them. That is, those who didn't do it themselves.

As living beings are wont to do, some survived, clinging aggressively, fervently to life, and learning the skills necessary to preserve it quickly. The Fel-Arcad who were able to stride or landed on or near settled regions were able to acquire aid and shelter, and these Fel-Arcad are the overwhelming majority who survived the nomadic period in their history. Others who weren't as lucky had to learn to live off the regions they were marooned on if they were unable to stride, and those who could became star-nomads, wandering the vast Dancirah for more of their kind.

During this era, the Fel-Arcad lived primarily among the (Lancasters) and the Danseers, with the more nomadic Fel-Arcad encountering Danseers during their travels and learning of the various powers, skills and knowledge they wielded in their travels through the Switchboard, as well as picking up their philosophies and manners of thinking. Fel-Arcad who dwelt among the Lancasters learned more of building families and societies, economics and trade, construction of settlements, relations with others and more 'mundane' subject matter. Under these conditions, the Fel-Arcad managed to thrive, becoming common faces throughout the Dancirah, integrating themselves within the fabrics of its social workings. 

But all the Fel-Arcad yearned for the home they once had, the First Arcology in the First Arcadia on Rosenthal, built by Arcad Rosen and the earliest Arcad ancestor-kin they shared, and all wished that there was a means for them to return to those days, and reclaim the glory they had lost. They had little idea how this would be the case, but gradually, their luck began to turn around as the aftershocks of the Refrain faded, and braver sojourners than most went out into the wider Astrolabic Cradle to investigate the wreckage of the astrolabic regions and the Astrolabe itself.

**They That Fell #7 - Second Dawn**
Between the Fel-Arcad and their dream of being a united peoples stood a litany of challenges. Primary among them was that they had no central arcology, and the schematics and tools to build them, as well as those who knew how had been lost in the Refrain. Even if they had an arcology to unite at, the Fel-Arcad had been scattered across the wedges of the Dancirah, and Fel-Arcad gathering at this arcology would have to cross the nigh-impassable Curtains of the void that cordoned off regions of space from each other. Even if there was a way to cross these major obstacles, and there was a new arcology waiting for them, there was no way to communicate the gathering of all Fel-Arcad to a new home to all displaced Fel-Arcad in the entire Switchboard.

The alleviation to one of these problems would come, however, as daring Striders began venturing to the astrolabic cradle and the star-debris around it, trawling the ruins of the regions for anything of value. In doing this, valuable lost records were recovered. Ritual schema, books of knowledge, documents on various studies, digital storage and more. Some wreckage of ruined labs still stood, even if marooned on floating asteroids, and from them even more was gleaned. The Fel-Arcad took immediate interest in this, and through the good will they had built with the Danseers and the Lancasters as they lived among them, they set about acquiring these recovered relics and artifacts, and it was not long until they began recovering old material relevant to the building and management of arcologies.

A particular oddity that emerged in the caches of those who went to explore the astrolabic cradle were pages written in script not native or known to any family at the time. More and more pages turned up in more and more hands, and scholars soon made the connection that they were all connected in some manner. Further study led them to conclude it was written in code of some format. Using the Slates and sheer dumb luck, they were able to piece together and decipher the contents of one page, and found that it was ritual schema unlike any seen before, requiring - among other things - **barristeel**, a material native to only the Astrolabe, leading many to conclude that these strange encrypted pages were astrolabic in origin, perhaps created in the chaos of the Refrain from the Astrolabe's calculus. They dubbed this gradually growing tome, the **Calcic Cartulary**, and made it their charge to complete the tome and decipher what lay within - a task that was given to the **Brass Monastery** when that would be formed.

The ritual they deciphered proved to be something incredible. When cast, using the incomprehensibly powerful barristeel as a component, it created a new material that would be dubbed **replichrome**, a metalloid material bearing the property of creating more of itself as it imbibed chalk. Further experimentation led to more discoveries about this material that shocked the Fel-Arcad and the Third Kin at the time. It was not long until many began to conceive of arcologies built of replichrome, capable of feasting on the chalk in the Dancirah and growing as living beings, as the First Arcology on Rosenthal had once done.

To accomplish this task, the first **Soleian Sanctum** was established, done so to train the first order of **Soleri**, those versed in the knowledge and practices of Arcad Rosen in building arcologies. They studied, experimented, and as more of their lost history and knowledge was pulled from the ruins of their past, they devoured it hungrily, driven by a desire to reclaim the lost glory of their ancestor-kin. As they did, word spread, even to distant corners of the Dancirah, and Fel-Arcad - torn by loss and hardened by their fight for survival - felt an old warmth they hadn't in a long time, taking up their few possessions and families and chasing the rumor of the restoration of their kin.

**They That Fell #8 - They That Rose Again**
Upon the region known as **Sanscrii**, the **Second Arcology** was built. The Second Arcology at Sanscrii - the Second Arcology, or the Sanscrii Arcology - was built from verdant green and replichrome, both spun on new looms built from old schematics. As it rose under the arduous hands of the Soleri, it grew by itself, wild and free, bursting forth with a desire to live that seemed reflective of the Fel-Arcad's own innate desire to rise again. Third Kin from all over came to see it, and to lend their aid in building what was clear to them was a mighty thing. And so the Second Arcology rose, and rose, and grew, sprawled, and as its trunk thickened and its leaves grew wide, more and more Fel-Arcad heard the news and gathered under its coverage.

And so, gradually, inconceivably, the Fel-Arcad multiplied, grew and replenished their ranks. They filled the new arcology they had built and continued to build and tend to, as it grew larger and greater to accompany them, until it sprawled across Sanscrii. And the Fel-Arcad that filled it were stronger, harder, wiser, greater in all manners and on all fronts than those who had filled the First Arcology they had ever built. They set about to their works, study and inquiry, building, replenishing.

But something was missing.

At the center of the Second Arcology was a void. The First Arcology had the Fey Curlicue at its center, the mighty tree that grew and held the canon of the then Arcad on its great trunk. In all the expeditions to the astrolabic cradle that had been done, none had been able to recover a seed for the Curlicue, or so much as a cutting of a tree. That was, until, a figure stepped forward. **Danseer Nadira**, a Danseer of some note, possessed a seed of a curlicue, which they claimed to have come from the Fey Curlicue that had stood in the First Arcology before the Refrain struck. Without tangible means to ascertain the truth of this statement, nor the utmost concern whether it were true or not, Nadira was celebrated among the Fel-Arcad for providing the crowning element of their restoration as a family.

**They That Rose #9 - The ArcDanseer Nadira**
Danseer Nadira became a prominent figure among the Fel-Arcad fairly swiftly. They would soon learn that this Danseer had lived among the Arcad all their life, and they had considered them kin and more Arcad than Danseer. They stated that they had spoken to and even learned under Arcad Rosen as one of his many pupils, learning in the intricacies of building arcologies, valuable knowledge they shared with the Soleri and their growing Sanctums. As he dwelt among the Fel-Arcad in their new arcology and earned their trust and adoration, they shared more of what they had learned from Rosen, including works penned by him that he safe-kept for ages.

From the teachings of Rosen through Nadira did the Fel-Arcad learn the ways they would structure the government of their arcologies and the dealings both within them and with external elements, and from did this did they create the first **Nadirian Eight** or Council of Eight, who would serve as the heads for arcologies the Switchboard over, consisting of various figures of varying skills and demeanors. Nadira taught them on the ways they would divide the powers of government into various wings to prevent abuse, how to govern fairly, how to coordinate trade and economics; how to achieve the lofty state that had been the First Arcology. They instructed the Nadirian Eight as their disciples, and asked them to compile their teachings and more that they had gleaned from the nomadic periods of the Fel-Arcad and their history in general, creating the **Annals of the Eight**, a tome that would be of great importance to all Fel-Arcad to come.

But perhaps most unique of Nadira's teachings was that of **Semblance**. A philosophy reached by both them and Arcad Rosen, they both held beauty - all that is aesthetically pleasing - in immensely high regard, a principle that informed many of the decisions they took and convictions they held. One such derivatives of it was proposed by Nadira; that there was a path to beauty of the self, a deep mental comfort with one's own physical being. Beauty was conceived of in the mind, and thus the same mind that created beauty and appreciated its presence, also mourned and suffered in its absence. When the mental took issue with the physical, there was disharmony and suffering.

Nadira was convinced that something 'plagued' the Third Kin through no fault of their own, but rather that of the Current. The Current was from where - it was believed - all Third Kin were born and where they returned to die, a melting pot of chalk from peoples many processions in the past. Nadira concluded that nothing - or rather no *one* - that could possibly emerge from this pot could be wearing a physical form that most suited who they were in their mind. They looked at this natural system and saw chaos and a propensity for error, and concluded that just as the Fel-Arcad had always done, they must take matters into their own hands. 

From these findings and philosophies they penned one of the more controversial tomes of Fel-Arcad relevance; **Thy Self, A Canvas**. In it, the 'Semblance Doctrine' as it was dubbed was described, as well as the path to achieving reconciliation with mind and body - the perfected Semblance - through usage of the Fel-Arcad weave-looms and grafts made from chalk and chrome. For this work, Nadira was given the title of **ArcDanseer**; Arcad Danseer, and was immortalized in Fel-Arcad canon.

**They That Rose #10 - Starwards**
And with this, the Fel-Arcad grew into the future. In this time they expanded across the Dancirah, building arcologies as they went. The Refrain's curse upon the Danseers struck and the Fel-Arcad were there to help their ancient allies, utilizing the Triptych Crucible to give rise to the Sil'khan. Philosophies formed and fell. Fel-Arcad did mighty things the Dancirah-over. Procession after procession came and went, but the Fel-Arcad stood strong, their place as one of the great families more than secured.

### 04. Appearance
I planted two baselines for the Fel-Arcad's appearance, one being their doctrine and the second being my desire to create my take on the elf/fae race that is a staple in fantasy fiction. 

In an old iteration, they were called they Fae or Fey-Arcad, and their arcologies were replaced instead by verdant coves and forests insulated from the big, scary outside world by chalk rituals. This was from a much older iteration from Samsara that I either don't remember particularly well for no particular reason, or there actually wasn't anything to remember because the idea got that far and then not a step further. I lean towards the latter.

The question of appearance then needs answering. Lets narrow the scope; the nature of the Fel-Arcad doctrine of semblance is that there is no 'one' Fel-Arcad appearance, as the diversity of appearance among any ten Fel-Arcad vastly outstrips probably the entire human species. So we should then narrow the scope to **what is the 'base' Fel-Arcad appearance?**

All Fel-Arcad that exist currently descend from the initial eight that peeled themselves from under the perfecting touch of the Lathe. From them, then, comes all biodiversity that exists among the Fel-Arcad. This, of course, is of no major consequence to chalk, so we will simply go with what I envision. 

Keeping with my initial vision for them as the world's fae/elf analogue, I decided on a humanoid baseplate, modified partially. **I elected that they keep the expected pointed ears as a quirk, and they have typically more slender frames as well**. I sought to **invoke a sort of 'plant-likeness' from them**, resembling the verdant arcadia they are domiciled within, as well as a sense of waifish '**distant genetic cousin**', looking similar but distinctly not so. 

For their colors I chose that they should resemble their arcadia. **Skin color at base is the same range of color as exists in us, thought weighted towards lighter tones**. **Hair and eyes is where most of the diversity exists, with both feasibly being any color imaginable** - plentiful as 'flowers in the meadow', as put by a better writer than I. **Imagine a people that *look* magical**; that is my aesthetic aim for the Fel-Arcad.

I have mentioned them having horns frequently in examples for a reason; culturally, I decided that **the visual manifestation of the social 'pecking order' as it were, would be size, shape and complexity/'ornateness' of horns present on the head**. A quirk of the Ritual of Conjugation is that these grafts find their way into the lattices of descendants, such that the characteristic is passed down generation over generation, resulting in very few individuals *not* having it. The inspiration for this was twofold, **first of them being the actual our-world equivalent of antlered or horned animals that signify their dominance and standing with their horns**. The second was a snap-decision; **an idea of Fel-Arcad having innate 'crowns' atop their heads**, that serve as an analogue to something similar observed in the other families.

>This refers to the Sil'khan 'halo', a manifestation of their power as Striders in the form of intangible 'light' around their heads.

I then pondered the question of sexual dimorphism. 

>As an aside, this topic is merely a singular gemstone in an entire jewelry box of a subject matter that I do not feel equipped - particularly - to discuss. I fortunately have learned individuals to call upon to bridge that gap between knowledge and execution. That being said, I will write what I envision as being narratively workable.

The point I will make on this topic is that as humans, we have very little by way of sexual dimorphism to begin with, exemplified by how our bodies know how to make us look more like one end of the spectrum or the other. The blueprints are there, as it were, dormant and merely asking for the right compounds to be fed to it to activate them. Considering how far we've come (relatively) on the mutability of our physical persons, and how the Fel-Arcad have taken the topic to its natural conclusion, it's fair to say that - ironically - **the sexual dimorphism that exists in them is exactly the same as ours** - but **the culture *around* that dimorphism is - for want of a better phrase - far less exacting**. 

### 05. Clothes & Bodily Adornments
This is an interesting one. Clothes are important to us, and a thorough thrashing of what clothes means to humans is - at minimum -  a minor in Art History. Instead we'll narrow the scope and broaden from there. We can begin with a couple of questions;

- What is the social perception of nakedness?
- What is the approach to clothes held by people with dynamic forms, both practically and socially?
- Do clothes have any particular social purpose that can't be otherwise accomplished?

The nakedness question is an interesting one. As humans, we by and large have agreed that it is socially unacceptable to have many parts of the body out on display. Hands are alright, arms up to the armpits are swell, legs are alright too, but too high up above the knees or exposing the feet outside of contexts such as beaches or sports, and we get kind of iffy. Center mass is somewhat okay - but not if you're seen as female, and below the waist is universally seen as a no-no. These sentiments are a product of history and modernity, as well as the dynamically shifting discourse around what feels to be majorly sexuality. 

We can focus on history for the Fel-Arcad. When the first chalkstriders emerged from the spontaneously woven lattices of the early Switchboard, there is absolutely no reason why they would rise from those synthesis locales with a fear of exposed crotches. We know this because we see it in human infants; they aren't born with innate knowledge that you just can't run around without pants - that's something that needs to be taught. So who taught the Fel-Arcad? Who taught anyone in the Switchboard?

This is the wrong approach. Here's what my - admittedly scanty knowledge on the topic - makes me conclude; we started wearing clothes long before we had any concept of modesty, and we kind of developed that sense of modesty once we were used to seeing each other covered up. The Switchboard is a dangerous place, and due to the nature of the theory of damage, most dangers necessarily have to affect you physically. A shield of fabric between you and that danger is a logical choice to make.

But that doesn't answer the question of what the Fel-Arcad think of nakedness. And so I'll go with this; the doctrine of semblance and the the mutability of the lattice have led Fel-Arcad to reach the same conclusion we have - **there's nothing 'disgusting' or immodest about what amounts to flesh hanging on a rack**. The difference is that the Fel-Arcad as a whole also actively practice it, due to the fact that nigh universally they accept this truth, as opposed to those of us who let our feelings of 'ickiness' take the place of actual arguments. That being said, they also realize that participating in wider Switchboard society has some requirements placed upon them at the gates; **the rest of the universe simply isn't as enlightened as you are, and thus you must cover up your dangly bits**. The result of this is that **while arcology-domiciled Fel-Arcad are very comfortable being scantily clad or wholly naked, those who grew up outside of them or have spent much time with people of other families will be far more inclined towards wearing clothing.** 

So now, what clothing do the Fel-Arcad wear? Lets do a thought experiment, how do you dress up a dog? It's quadrupedal and has a head and a tail, so clothes suitable for a relatively similarly-sized human infant with modifications made for freedom of movement around the joints, and a cut out in the pants for a tail should be sufficient. How do you dress up a bear? It's even easier; upsize the dog's clothing. You can even close the tail hole. Now how do you dress up a bird? A pair of limbs are now wings, and the remaining legs can't fit into shoes. How about a crab? You don't even have a head anymore as we understand heads, and now you have those big claws and all the legs to contend with.

What point am I driving at? **Clothing is immensely dependent on body plan, and even minor deviations from that plan reveal the many failures of clothing**. You need only to have been someone whos heavier than the average, or thinner, or taller, or someone like me with very large feet (size fifties), to find that **clothing simply isn't all that accommodating**. Our clothes are like skin in how they grip our bodies, and any quirks produce immediate discomfort. 

These are practical issues we face. What would clothes look like among people with horns? Hats are immediately less popular - especially if horns are a symbol of social standing - or they need cut outs and such to function. If there's diversity in horn shapes and such, most hats will need to be made to order. Most will choose to forgo them entirely. How about a culture where people have wings? If they anchor from the back, jackets and shirts will need cutouts. If they anchor on the small of the back, just above the waist, pants will need to sit lower on the legs. These are just two examples, but already **we have considerable deviations from conventional clothing**. 

When you couple the fact the Fel-Arcad aren't particular about clothing to begin with, with the fact that clothing, physiologically, is a complex nuisance, you'd be right to conclude that their approach to clothing would be one of **maximizing freedom and utility at the expense of aggressive coverage of all the body** we don't like. **I think the Fel-Arcad would dress as we see from Greek scholars or cultures in India; with long, flowing garments that cover enough due to their volume, but aren't made restrictive by seams and folds**. They wear **sashes and robes with numerous cutouts, kept from being blown away by strong winds using belts and fasteners**. They dress with the knowledge that what's under the clothes could be radically different the very next day, and **any impediment to the constant pursuit of being truer to one's inner self - one's semblance - should be done away with.**

Lets talk materials. The arcology living of the Fel-Arcad allows for utopic growing conditions for plants and animals, and as such, their clothing is sourced from these rather than from artificial polymers typically derived from say - petroleum products. That being said, I also envision the Fel-Arcad as being non-violent people, valuing life that isn't their own at least as much - if not just as much - as theirs, something we'll discuss more when we get to diet. And so their clothing materials are sourced non-violently; no wearing leather or animal pelts as that can't be sourced without killing something. Wool is fine however, as that can be obtained without harm. They naturally prioritize light fabrics, and keeping in line with their 'enlightened scholars' schtick, I imagine them as dressed in linens regularly, with lace, silk and chiffon employed when the question is skewed by class and occasion.

So now for the social purpose of clothing. Lawyers and businessmen wear suits. Doctors wear scrubs. Engineers wear overalls, reflective jackets and hardhats. Clothing serves purpose, particularly that of identification. The question of 'what do various professions in Fel-Arcad society wear?' is one that really should come after 'what are the various professions in Fel-Arcad?' society. That's a discussion for later.

Body adornments we can do fairly easily, in that their approach to it isn't much different from ours. Jewelry and piercings serve to beautify, with some some carrying special significance where applicable. Similarly is the case for tattoos. Hair styles are typically ornate, with styling involving jewelry woven into the hair, with the hair itself taking on a litany of styles. Particularly favored are collections of braids that culminate in bundles of hair resembling the various blooms that grow in the arcadia. 

### 06. Individuals and Families
#### On Individuals
> A foreword; this section was written a considerable time after the one following it was, and in fact, was written after much of this document was completed. It is thus recommend to read much of the rest of this document first and then referring back to this one. It will also adopt a different tone, one use when I was first making this document, begun almost half a year before.
> 
> That about explains it, I reckon.


#### On Families
Lets discuss Fel-Arcad society. What conclusions can we draw from their history and present about how they structure it? What do their families look like across the size and relationship spectra? 

There is something I want to avoid and that is the cliché 'enlightened' post-everything society where all social constructs have been done away with and they've reached manners of being that we haven't even begun to speculate - the descendants of the discourse about society that exists now, as it were. Why am I opposed to this? Because I feel it's been done before for one, and I don't see the narrative potential that can emerge from it except when it inevitably clashes with the ways of being exhibited by other families. There is realism in imperfection. There is beauty to be found in striving towards an ideal end. I value those two things more than whatever statement - political, economic, social or otherwise - that I make by saying "This is how this society exists, notice how I describe it as a utopia."

The discussion on the families of the Fel-Arcad can begin first and foremost with what effects the Ritual of Conjugation has had on their society. The Ritual of Conjugation necessarily compels new ways of looking at families because it allows new ways of *creating* them. Under the Conjugation, a descendant may have three parents - all of the existing Fel-Arcad descend from eight, after all - and this compels us to then ask what are the names of the roles taken on by these three parents. Are they a father, father and mother? Or some other combination of these? Do these terms still hold under this system? Should they? It's hard to say.

I think a way of looking at it is using my perspective as someone from a third world nation, where familial ties are necessarily strong and valued. There is a sort of consolidation that is employed in that we do away with terms that create social distance where not necessary, due to the sheer lack of physical distance. For most of my life, my dad's brother - my fraternal uncle - lived with us in the same house. When I did not know better, he was my uncle, but he called me his kid brother, and my sister - his niece - his kid sister. Why was this the case? I have a cousin now that lives with us. I call him my brother and he does likewise. Why? I have cousins outside the country who I call cousins, but if they came to stay with us, I'd call them my sisters. Again, why?

My conclusion is that the specifics of it - uncles, aunts, cousins, second cousins, nieces and nephews and the various flavors 'something removed' - only matter to kingmakers and census officials and other people and contexts where it is absolutely necessary we can establish the lines of ancestry and descendance. Otherwise, why really does it matter? I propose an umbrella - 'kin' - an encompassing term that accomplishes what it needs to; establishes that the bonds between us are blood rather than water. When it is time for pettiness and nuance, we shall be petty and nuanced, but outside of that, it is enough for any outside inquirer to know that I am closer to the third party than I am to them. We may modify kin with prefixes to indicate placement on the vertical axis; 'ancestor-kin' and 'descendant-kin' where necessary, with 'father-kin', 'daughter-kin', and others in a similar vein to indicate what their names imply. We may contract terms - cestorkin and cendantkin or ceskin and cenkin to go even shorter - to indicate the sentiment of parent and child, and utilize 'neutrokin', 'nuceskin' and 'nucenkin' for non-binary Fel-Arcad, modified for ancestor and descendant respectively. 

With that established then, a family is whatever combination that its participants see fit. Your parents would be your ceskin, your children your cenkin, and your siblings merely your kin. We do away with all else and consolidate it down to this.

We can talk about some fringe cases. Suppose a family friend is adopted into a family, we could use the term 'other-kin' for them for a period, until they are fully accepted in and become kin, with their placement on the vertical established by the rest of the family. 

We can then talk rituals. Marriage is one of them. Do the Fel-Arcad marry, do something similar, or in their enlightenment have they gone beyond that as well and simply start families the way you incorporate a business? I think the most latter is bland and pretentious. 

>And allow me for a bit to go on a tangent. I do not blame anyone for thinking the way I'm about to describe, nor do I fault them for arriving at that manner of thinking, but bear with me; in our noble, righteous strive to dismantle the one thousand and one oppressive, inhuman institutions of the old world, we should not in our haste throw the baby out with the bath water. We see marriage as a predominantly white, heteronormative and Christian institution and because of the track record of those things we cry "No more! Abolish it!" But what replaces it? 

>I have no issue with civil unions. I have absolutely no problem with choosing to go to court, sign a document and grab a pizza on the way home. If that is what you choose, may all power in heaven and earth find their way to your arms. But I sincerely hope that it does not become commonplace and widespread. I sincerely hope that we do not do away with the thousands of practices and ceremonies and rituals practiced by tens of thousands of cultures since the dawn of time simply because our only approach is to let the pendulum swing to the extreme - just in the opposite direction. I sincerely hope we do not erase all the humanity of the old world and replace it with anodyne, lifeless bureaucratic paper-pushing all in the name of 'enlightenment' and 'progress'. As someone who doesn't even care for these things, I would hate for human culture to turn so grey and sanitized. The aims are noble and justifiable, but the methods are not ideal.

>I ask that we consider something different; let us reclaim and redefine instead of erase. Let us still practice these customs - remaining aware of their bloodied and muddied histories - but elect to still participate because they bring beauty and value to being. We are not machines. An attempt to be as machines is futile. We should appreciate these things because that is our nature. The push for observing any and all things through the perspectives of hyper-economizing, hyper-individualism, focus on convenience and rejection of the old is too broad a stroke to paint these topics with. We will hate what comes out on the other side.

I feel that for the Fel-Arcad - and applying to all families really - they mark and celebrate the same things that we do. Births, unions, bringing in new kin into the fold, various coming of age ceremonies, the Fel-Arcad are necessarily a communal people, made so by the nature of the arcologies. They are dense with people but not uncomfortably so, and there is intermingling between nearly all that live in the arcologies. 

Where we go a little more into detail is in what differences between their ceremonies and ours exist, and this is where I wish I had completed [[The Doctrine of Passing]]. We can take the general grab-bag of them; birth, birthdays, marriage and/or unions, and death. Under the Switchboard, certain ages are marked with somewhat lesser ceremonies that highlight the processions elapsed on the path to 'adulthood'. The Fel-Arcad mark these as well. Unions is there analogue to marriage, differing in that occasionally, one individual is joining a couple or more, or many are joining many. Deaths and funerals are - expectedly - somber affairs, with attendance being the deceased kin primarily, and the wider arcology if so inclined.

The intricacies of these ceremonies are worth discussing. Concerning birth, I recommend reading the document on [[On Birthing and Being#On Descendance|Descendance]] first, that way you won't be confused when I say that cenkin formed from the Conjugation typically have obtained enough information from their ceskin and the environs of the arcology to emerge with fully functional minds capable of though, reasoning - and thus - naming themselves. 

Birth via traditional methods - though uncommon - follows a familiar procedure that I will derive from my own culture; that of the naming ceremony, in which eight days (six in the Switchboard) after a child's birth, all the kin and well-wishers gather to bestow the child with names. The ceskin make their first choices, followed by existing kin to the child, then the wider arcology.

Offspring from the Conjugation however, are able to pick their names themselves, and the ceremony is often done at their behest - when they feel they are ready. They choose their first name, the one they will most commonly go by, then their ceskin will choose one for them, their kin choose another, and then the wider arcology may bestow one upon them as they see fit. As such, most Fel-Arcad have four names; the one taken, the one given by ancestors, the one given by siblings, and the one given by the wider Fel-Arcad body. Once the names are chosen, the subject inscribes them on the branches of the Curlicue growing at the center of every arcology, adding to its vast canon. The ceremony is capped off with the expected; music, dancing, theatre, eating and drinking.

	The coming of age ceremonies are the next in the stack, and because I have not written DocPass, this section will remain unwritten. That being said, the structure of these is a ceremony held every eight processions - representative of the Eight - signifying the rise to adulthood, concluding at twenty-four processions.

Next on the ceremonies are unions, of which there are three types; one to one, one to many, and many to many. These ceremonies are dominated primarily in displays between one set of kin and the other, in the form of friendly competition in the arts and calcic proficiency. Second is the recitation of family canons, reliving past births, ceremonies of age, past unions and sharing peace over deaths.

And it wouldn't be a union without rings. I pondered what symbolic things could be done with the rings to symbolize the union and all that surrounds it. My first draft of an idea was that, after twenty four processions, each Fel-Arcad is able to forge themselves a replichrome ring, which they carry with them as a part of their person. When forming unions, the rings are cut and then sections belonging to each party in the union are welded to each other's rings. Suppose you were forming one with someone else, you would cut your ring in half, collect one half from them and give them one half as well. The sections would fuse, and you'd have a 'part' of the partner with you. As a narrative point, the ring would imbibe the chalk around its owner, causing microscopic growths that showed their connection to their wearer, similar to a fingerprint. 

It then raises the question of how divorce is handled. There's something visually cruel about returning your someone else's section of the ring and asking for yours back, but I feel that it truly encapsulates the spirit of divorce; breaking apart what was once melded together. I feel the only clause I can place is that the wider arcology ensures things are handled amiably and maturely, and that parties split on as good terms as is possible.

Single ceskin-hood (parenthood) and outright orphaning of cenkin doesn't really exist in Fel-Arcad society, due to the communal nature of living. Referendums are held in both cases to either provide for the singular ceskin, and adopt orphaned cenkin into willing families. 

Funerals are fairly straightforward; the kin gather in a ceremony of 'dust to dust', in which the body of the deceased (unless otherwise asked) is buried at the foot of the Curlicue tree at the heart of the arcology, and then end of their canon is inscribed on its branches. The body is broken down into chalk and assimilated into the replichrome of the arcology and the body of the tree, a symbolic gesture showing that, though gone, the dead remain - forever - close to us. 

### 07. Respect & Hierarchies
Fel-Arcad social theorists both work and pride themselves on putting the more amorphous things of social mechanisms down to something of a science. Their endless qust for understanding has led them to study - as with many other things - what earns one respect in Fel-Arcad society, and thus the hierarachies that emerge from this, divesting those who have earned respect from those who have not.

In their studies they have identified roughly **six** core bases upon which respect is consciously and subconsciously allocated in Fel-Arcad society. They have come to designate them with old Arcad words, words in Thalian, spoken by the Arcad when they divested themselves from the entirety of the Third Kin as a unique peoples;

1. **Harai** - Character
2. **Hakush** - Study
3. **Noryok** - Accomplishment
4. **Nenre** - Age
5. **Tomi** - Wealth
6. **Tabii** - Travel

**Harai - Character**
Valued most highly in Fel-Arcad society is, above all, character. To be possessed of undeniable, open virtue engenders one to the general Fel-Arcad populace, and much of active and passive allocation of positions of high standing is done with those believed of possessing good harai. It goes without saying that such sentiment is cultivated over many, many processions and is the product of the conclusions of a very many parties. It is done - often - at the expense of the subject, as even the arcologies present avenues for cutting corners, sometimes even harmlessly, and it takes one of considerable moral fortitude to spurn even such.

Conversely, those perceived to have particularly low harai are - though not openly - treated in a manner some might describe as 'accordingly'. Digging oneself out of the social hole that is being believed to have low harai is no mean feat, taking selfless - often uncompensated - service to both Fel-kind and the arcology itself. Many elect to simply leave the arcology of their birth, choosing instead to begin anew in the wilds, under new names and with a clean slate.

Unlike other bases, those with harai aren't given any particular title, as humility is also voted as a core component of the principle.

As a note on the nature of harai itself, many scholars - particularly those outside the Fel-Arcad - argue that harai is different from other families' interpretation of having good character, arguing further that harai is less so a measure or indication of moral fiber, but more so a means of referring to those who are particularly adept at, consciously or not, dwelling under the arcology model. They state that a feedback loop exists in which the arcology compels those within it to act in certain manners for the arcology as an entity to succeed, and simultaneously the institutions that are built upon the arcology reward those who act in this manner, one of these institutions being the Fel-Arcad peoples themselves. They pose the question of whether selflessness and honesty are valued because of the innate value of these things to kin, or because the arcology is uniquely positioned - unlike other models of living - to be particularly vulnerable to the proliferation of vices. 

In particular they state how Fel-Arcad believed to possess great harai find that it does not effectively translate to non-arcology environments. Of course, they are forced to confront the Fel-Arcad argumentative rejoinder that is pointing out certain virtues are less valued outside of the arcologies because beyond the arcologies are innumerable flawed systems, and that to decry virtue for not being valuable in a den of thieves is to greatly miss the essence of being virtuous. Argued by many though, is that the Fel-Arcad cannot be trusted to be faithful and loyal to *people*; that the institution of the arcology demands a form of subservience to it that isn't common in the other families (with the exception of perhaps the Vahnkin) and as such, a Fel-Arcad will rarely act in a manner believed to be anti-establishment, especially when the shape of harai is both determined and allocated by such establishments.

In a sense, the value of harai is determined wholly by the existence of the arcologies, something that some believe diminishes its value somewhat. At the crux of it is the belief that the tenets of cultivating good harai are not universally, are instead uniquely formulated to facilitate Fel-Arcad living.

**Hakush - Study**
Perhaps by being the self-appointed scholars of the Switchboard, the Fel-Arcad have come to value the act of study in itself, as an extension, those who diligently pursue it. As the Switchboard is a place built of information in the literal sense, there are those who have made it their utmost charge to discover and understand as much of it as is possible.

For this reason, the many Fel-Arcad institutions of learning are - by extension - a viable means to cultivating a respectable persona, as those of great learnedness are viewed highly by others of considerable learnedness as well. Considering the many positions of arcological authority have - even if not explicitly stated - a certain amount of intellectual and academic prowess required to truly qualify for the position in the minds of onlookers - who double as the electorate - it thus reaffirms the fact that hakush is valued highly among the Fel-Arcad peoples.

**Noryok - Accomplishment**
A somewhat vague one, that describes the state of being recognized in general. Even in their striving towards building a more egalitarian society, there are those who distinguish themselves in service to that society, and there is social and psychological justification for recognizing them specially - and above others.

The various marks of accomplishment - medals, plaques, certificates and trophies - are conferred by the various bodies that operate within an arcology, and thus the value of any one accomplishment - and by extension, the sum of all the accomplishments possessed by a subject - are determined by the general social capital possessed by the various issuers of these marks. Generally, the Fel-Arcad value accomplishments earned in the service of the public and the arcology, over those earned serving private interests or the self. 

In this manner, a certificate earned for excellent service as a janitor in a Craun office is generally seen as a greater, more 'true' accomplishment than one earned in say, excellent performance in a pipeskating championship - though it goes without saying that this is deterministic upon audience.

**Nenre - Age**
The Fel-Arcad have been blessed above the other families to live particularly long lives, and in this time they are opportune to see - and to experience - much. For this reason, the aged among the Fel-Arcad are conferred a bit of rank.

The oldest in an arcology are its living curlicue, telling the tales of those who dwelt within it and of the arcology itself. In having dwelt among a people for a long time, they are valued for their input on the nature of the peoples of an arcology and on peoples in general, this discipline being viewed as teachable, but not graspable in the manner as someone who has done so actively for procession over procession. 

While the elderly among the Fel may be considered for this reason in election or appointment to various posts, it ultimately fades in comparison to other metrics as a means to judge raw competency.

**Tomi - Wealth**
The Fel-Arcad acknowledge wealth, but not particular much, and not particularly well in some circles. Some scholars are of the opinion that the arcology model and institutions derived from it general prevent the gross accumulation of material resource, and as such anyone in possession of considerable resource has done so either through cheating or 'breaking' the system, or at immense cost to ones own ability to live life fully.

In some Fel-Arcad circles, all the same, it is at least acknowledged that some amount of acumen must be possessed to achieve the feat of wealth gathering in a space almost actively hostile towards it, and thus it is in turn considered that this acumen - turned towards other ends - would in turn yield considerable boon for the Fel-Arcad peoples.



## STRATA THREE
### 09. Naming & Language
#### Names
For the Fel-Arcad, I decided that on a naming aesthetics front they will be culturally Japanese, thus individual Fel-Arcad and various names for other things relevant to them will use Japanese or adjacent nomenclature.

The Fel-Arcad often bear four names, the taken name, the one given by ancestors (or family/last name), the name given by siblings and friends, and the name given by the arcology. The names follow a number of paradigms based on certain skews. 

At base, a Fel-Arcad's roster of names are;
- A Japanese name.
- A name of something relating to nature; particularly flowers.
> VoiFleur when.

and this is modified by certain sects that the Fel-Arcad may belong to, examples of this being;

- Feljourn often take Sil'khan names, or append 'Sil' or 'Khan' to one of the names they already bear. They may also take names that allude to the Skydancers, or the names of distant regions.
- Rosenthalists have a habit of calling themselves Arcad in place of their family names, or having 'Rosen' somewhere in their names.
- Soleri have names that allude to light or suns, or have 'sol' somewhere in their names.
- Fel-Arcad artists and artisans take their profession as a name, or a corruption of the word itself or words relating to it. There are many Fel bearing the names Painter, Weaver, Mason, Spinner, and the like. Sembleworkers in particular are fond of names referring to spinning, weaving and the like.
> Regarding the above name, these are naturally transformed into their Japanese equivalents.

	As a final note regarding naming, I may expand beyond merely Japanese and instead utilize names from adjacent cultures, perhaps if I need to differentiate between various schisms or sub-factions of Fel-Arcad. Time will tell.

#### Language
At the dawn of the Third Kin, they all arose speaking a fairly elementary proto-language. As they spread across the astrolabic regions and gradually began to differentiate into the families at the time, they naturally evolved differing languages as well, reflective of their individual and collective natures. 

The first language spoken by the Third Kin was, rather simply, dubbed the '**Kinspeak**' by historians on the matter. Recognized for what it was and appropriately named so, the Third Kin at the time spoke it in the company of other Third Kin that differed from their own families, and reverted to the slowly emerging second generation tongues in the company of their own folk. 

The earliest Arcad's language evolved primarily around the time of the construction of the First Arcology at Rosenthal. As the Arcad of the time were compelled into working together and thus interacting fairly closely with one another, their language gradually took form, reaching a state of differentiation from the Kinspeak that historians came to call **Thalian**. The Arcad majorly spoke Thalian for much of the time that they operated in the Switchboard, and Thalian held sway over the Arcad right up until the Refrain.

When the Arcad became the Fel-Arcad and began their nomadic period, Thalian was the language they spoke, but it gradually became corrupted as the Fel-Arcad moved and dwelt among the various other denizens and locales of the Switchboard, becoming a collection of slightly differing 'pidgins' that were localized to various sectors of the Switchboard. As Fel-Arcad gradually began to come together again in larger groups, the pidgins began to homogenize into a new tongue. These **Losthals** or 'lost Thalian' dialects would later come to be studied in the formation of the larger tongue used by the vast majority of the Dancirah.

With the formation of Sanscrii and the homogenization of the Losthals, Fel-Arcad linguists settled to the task of the formation of a new language that would enter the service of the Fel-Arcad, with the intention that it be used for possibly, until the extinction of the Fel-Arcad as a people. Endless deliberation led to the formation of the **Sanscryvan**, the most widely-accepted vernacular for the Fel-Arcad and sees extensive use in majorly Fel circles such as within arcologies.

However, it became necessary for their to be a means to communicate among other peoples in the Switchboard, a 'lingua franca' that would be adopted into Dancirah-wide use. Fel-Arcad linguists met with the then Danseers, Lancasters and some Vahnkin to pool their ideas together in a series of conventions and many processions of study and iteration, leading eventually to the formation of the **New Danciran Standard**, which saw widespread adoption among the denizens of the Dancirah, but not nearly as much proliferation among the Vahnkin and other dwellers in Isalveh, the Challenger Dark. 

The NDS's roots being primarily Sanscryvan gave the Fel-Arcad an advantage in learning it, but this reason is cited as why the kin of Vahn were disinclined to using it, seeing it as one of the many 'creations of the sky' they were slowly growing to view with disregard.

As such, Sanscryvan or 'Scryvan' became the commonly used tongue by Fel-Arcad amongst themselves, with courtesy demanding they employ NDS or 'Standard' in the presence of others.

Listeners have describe the various Fel-Arcad tongues as long-winded, elegantly cadenced, and downright musical. Much Fel-Arcad discussion sounds like singing, or poetry recitations, with truly angry exhortations delivered in Scryvan mimicking theatrical displays. Some have disapprovingly called it a 'tongue of weaklings' or 'the verbal preening of self-important birds'. While the Fel-Arcad aren't ones to be particularly wounded by such remarks, it was taken into consideration during the creation of the Standard. 

### 10. Faith & Religion
The Fel-Arcad as a people are largely atheistic. Concrete records of their history allows for the tracing of their descent from the origination of all Third Kin down to now, and going through this history has led most to conclude that no power guided the choices made and their resultants other than mundane calcic mechanics. That being said, there are some who do hold some certain figures, constructs and concepts in high regard, and while it can be said that there are subtle or even overt religious undertones exhibited by members of given groups, deeper inquiry will lead to the conclusion that 'worship' of 'godlike figures' isn't being practiced.

##### The Fel-Arcad Peoples
**The Nadiran**
Encompassing the vast majority of the Fel-Arcad are the Nadiran, Fel-Arcad who by and large subscribe to the teachings of the ArcDanseer Nadira (hence the name) conveyed through the Annals of the Eight, inhabit the various arcologies of the Switchboard and adhere to the Semblance Doctrine.

The Nadiran Fel-Arcad are largely a peaceful, pacifistic people, dwelling in the various arcologies in the Switchboard, spending their days in service of themselves through artistic, scientific and leisurely pursuits, as well as serving fellow Fel-Arcad kind through the upkeep of the arcologies they dwell within. 

As processions past, the generation of Fel-Arcad who experienced the days of the nomadic period is slowly phased out, as the number of Fel-Arcad who've known no other life outside the arcologies gradually grows. The Nadiran are largely satisfied with their place in the Dancirah, with few drawn to the days as their kin had once lived, or as the Feljourn live even now. Chief among their worries, however, remains an ever-present fear of a Second Refrain. All Nadiran have studied the works that recorded their past, and all know that no arcology would be safe from another of the Astrolabe's great resolutions of its calculus. Even as they admire the walls of the nigh-utopic abodes they dwell in, none sits as easily as they'd like knowing how easily and suddenly it can be ripped away.

This does little to deter the Nadiran, however, who live full lives in spite of this hanging blade above their heads, carving an undeniable space for themselves in the Switchboard.

**The Feljourn**
The Second Arcology - the Sanscrii arcology - brought an end to the nomadic period the Fel-Arcad underwent - but it did not bring about an end to nomadic Fel-Arcad. Though many answered the call to come, build and inhabit the new arcology that would house their people, many Fel-Arcad had grown accustomed to the star-wilds, finding that they rather enjoyed their nomadic lifestyles. As such, many Fel-Arcad did not answer this call, and refused to return to the arcologies, choosing instead to wander the stars. They came to be known as the **Feljourn**.

This schism caused considerable concern among many Fel-Arcad, whos near-deification of the arcologies led them to see a voluntary renouncement of them as beyond conception, with some even denouncing it as heresy. And while many Fel-Arcad, particularly Soleri and those particularly devoted to them and what they stood for, argued that returning to the arcologies was almost mandatory - a service to all Fel-Arcad and a continuation of custom that could not be shirked - a fair bit more were disinclined to make much of the Feljourn, seeing them as not much different from the Danseers who still roamed the Dancirah.

The Feljourn, however, began to grow. Naturally they did so as peoples tend to do so, but also they found that their ranks began to swell as some Fel-Arcad were drawn to their manner of living, and chose to voluntarily leave the arcologies in pursuit of the many stories and promises that naturally formed around the Feljourn as they journeyed the stars. Similarly, Fel-Arcad who for one reason or another found themselves ousted from the arcologies - often due to exile as a punishment for some offence - easily found a home among the Feljourn and their traveling bands. The growth of the Feljourn fed their own growth, and more were drawn to their ranks with the passage of time.

This greatly concerned the Soleri. Arcologies are complex concepts both on paper and in physical form, and core to the functioning of any arcology is a critical population of inhabitants who are capable of working to upkeep the arcology - a task that still exists despite the various autonomous systems that exist within them. Many of the Fel-Arcad abandoning the arcologies to sail the stars were demographically young, strong and often were the few among the Fel-Arcad who possessed the Strider Protocol. It posed a huge threat of manpower loss to the Soleri, and left unchecked, it could lead to the degradation of the standards of living within the arcologies, which would prompt more migration out of them, sealing their fate to collapse entirely. This, they felt, would ripple and cascade through the Switchboard, and lead to a chain reaction of collapse. A disaster scenario. They had to find a means to prevent this.

They chose to make a case against the Feljourn, some parts of it fair criticism, but plenty of it viewable as a malicious move to smear them. They chose to portray the Feljourn as a singular mass populated by bands of exiled outlaws and criminals, as well as ungrateful Fel-Arcad who had let 'a few years of hardship' forget their rich heritage. Additionally, they took many of the Feljourn tales - often dominated by less-than-savory (by Fel-Arcad metrics, anyway) characters doing questionable things - and skewed them just a tad bit blacker, portraying Feljourn 'heroes' and noteworthy characters as morally grey, casual users of violence so long as it gave results, and driven by a strange madness to see, take - but never build and inhabit. They peddled this sentiment among the arcology-dwelling Fel-Arcad, and it was met with a fair bit of success as the Fel-Arcad found the slowly emerging Feljourn book of principles to not be particularly in line with their own.

The Feljourn, however, prepared a rejoinder that was anything but negligible. Scholarly Feljourn in their ranks prepared papers and material denouncing the arcologies, with some of the more zealous ones demanding for their total abolishment. The grounds upon which they stood was evidence that showed arcologies were ready breeding grounds for a litany of social ills, served as stomping grounds for tyrannical dictator Soleri, responsible for the pacification of the Fel-Arcad into a docile-to-a-fault people, excellent targets in times of conflict, and their centralization of populations the whole reason why the Refrain was so catastrophic in the first place. They argued that none of the benefits of the arcologies outweighed the drawbacks, or even began to outweigh the richness of experience that was traversing the Dancirah.

With scholars on either side locked in yet another of the Fel-Arcad's seemingly innumerable philosophical conflicts, laypeople on either side were far more inclined to deal with each other in trade and commerce, the Feljourn proving splendid hires for various tasks in the Switchboard, as they operated much like the Danseers, but were more palatable to the Fel-Arcad as they were functionally cousins. As a nomadic people, they served to move goods and information across the Switchboard, and their work established many of the most plied routes through the stars in the Switchboard, establishing infrastructure such as waystations which would prove particularly useful to the Sil'khan when they would emerge a fair bit later.

The Feljourn espouse a strong doctrine of freedom and discovery, sharing the Sil'khan quality of aiming to see as much of the Switchboard as possible. Most Feljourn are thus Striders rather than solely Weavers as most Fel-Arcad are. In many ways they are like the Sil'khan, though they do espouse many Fel-Arcad principles, with many still adhering to the Nadirian Semblance Doctrine and having strong beliefs on cohabiting with the Switchboard rather than merely taking from it, through principles of eco-conservation and using weave and the ritualism to satisfy their various needs. It is on this latter point that the Feljourn differ considerably from the Danseers and the Sil'khan, in that in their travels, they aim not to destroy or consume the Switchboard as they pass through it, taking in its various sights, drinking of the many boons leftover from yesterdays - and leaving it better than they met it for future generations to come.

In clinging to their Fel-Arcad roots, some bands of Feljourn still take Curlicue cuttings with them, with Fel-Arcad writings and doctrine on them, due to their inability to take a whole Curlicue tree with them. While some Feljourn integrate with other families or form their own non-arcology settlements, most are exclusively nomads, roaming the stars to find meaning beyond the confines of the domiciles of their ancestor-kin.

While most arcology-dwelling Fel-Arcad are mostly indifferent to the Feljourn, sentiment ranging from admiration of the bravery of leaving the near-utopic conditions of the arcology, to derision of their supposed stupidity for that very reason, many do not deny the usefulness they serve as being a bridge between arcologies and the wider Switchboard, the Feljourn being major drivers of trade and commerce, as well as making fairly dependable mercenaries and contracted workers. In a truly ironic display, Soleri who are prone to more direct action against colleagues viewed as rivals to them are not above hiring less-than-scrupulous Feljourn for their backhanded misdeeds.

**The Rosenthalists**
The Rosenthalists pride themselves as 'Arcad purists' and the shape of this 'purism' has led to non-trivial amounts of internal strife between them and other groups of Fel-Arcad.

The Rosenthalists form an order that chooses to follow their interpretation of an 'old ways' of how the Fel-Arcad existed. They reject the teachings of ArcDanseer Nadira for various reasons; believing their claims of tutelage under Arcad Rosen to be unprovable at best, outright lies at worst, believing that a non-Arcad shouldn't have so much sway over Arcad society, believing the Semblance Doctrine to be nonsensical and actively working towards a Second Refrain, and believing the Second Arcology to be blasphemy against the first arcology built by Arcad Rosen. They refuse to call themselves 'Fel'-Arcad, arguing that they shouldn't be defined by catastrophe.

Needless to say, they abhor the current state of the Fel-Arcad, and see it as something in need of fixing. The means of doing this, they believe, is written in the **Redsight** section of **The Farseer's Lament**, believing it to be the true writings of Arcad Rosen, and thus the only instruction they should follow. They argue that the Redsight was the true vision of Arcad Rosen; an Arcad peoples that subdued all others, permeating throughout the Dancirah, and only when there was an Arcad majority could they realize the dreams of the younger Arcad Rosen, who espoused pacifism and nonviolently dwelling in the Dancirah - a future only possible among Fel-Arcad.

The methods of working towards this end vary as do the various sub-factions within the Rosenthalists. Some choose to employ subterfuge and clandestine methods to take control of arcologies run by other groups, rallying them to join the wider Rosenthalist cause. Some Rosenthalists are militant, and choose to attack arcologies and other families, expanding their stellar territory through conquest. Their practice of collapsing opposing arcologies has an element of ceremony around it, with raiding parties seen as crusading soldiers and being met with rewards and repute for successful excursions.

A notable group among the Rosenthalists consider themselves to have descended directly from Arcad Rosen, though the proof of this claim remains fairly shaky. Nonetheless, they rule the Rosenthalists as a monarchy rules a kingdom, and they are believed to be the only ones able to build 'righteous' arcologies as the direct descendants of Arcad Rosen. Asides from these Rosenthal Arcologies, the actions of the Rosenthalists leave many **Black Arcologies** in their wake. These black arcologies have become hubs in the Switchboard for all sorts of criminality, ranging from acquiring questionable lattice-grafts, potent chemistries, dangerous and banned ritual schema, stolen maps, outlawed weapons and technologies, and ancient vault objects of interest.

As a result of the perceived heresy of the ArcDanseer, many Rosenthalists despise the Danseers and the Sil'khan by extension, and have made it a point to refuse dealings with them, or be particularly brutal to those at their mercy. Many view the Sil'khan to be the largest stumbling block to the Redsight future, as the Sil'khan as a people are powerful Striders and fighters and firm allies of the Fel-Arcad, particularly the Nadiran. Within the darkest covens of the blackest arcologies, it is rumored that Rosenthalist sembleworkers tear open the weave of captured Sil'khan, seeking to understand more about lattices and the Strider Protocol from these 'manufactured' beings.

Their rejection of the Semblance Doctrine is noteworthy as well, at its crux being the fact it was proposed by the ArcDanseer, as well as a general conviction of the belief the Current is not something fallible as the Nadiran believe. Coupled with the writings of the Brass Monastery on the nature of the Astrolabe, they reach a series of conclusions on the Semblance Doctrine;

  - The Current is a resultant of the calculus of the Astrolabe, and thus cannot simply 'make mistakes' as the Semblance Doctrine claims it does. This means that such thing as a 'wrong body' doesn't exist, and that bodies issued to all are exactly that which they require for their tenure.
  - The various modifications to the self being made by semblance-adhering Fel-Arcad is 'diluting' the Current, filling it with meaningless chalk in the form of grafts that only had use to their owner in their time. This dilution results in a decline in the information mass of what is passed on to new generations of Third Kin born in the Switchboard, a literal decline in the quality of people produced.
  - Building off of the prior point, some conclude that this 'clogging' of the current with spun chalk is building towards a Second Refrain.
  - Some argue that the Fel-Arcad's obsession with this reconciliation has resulted in their elimination of all struggle in their lives; that the only hurdle one arises to solve is that of achieving a body they are most satisfied with, and thus are disinclined to do much else than merely exist and indulging in leisurely pursuits. They argue that growth comes through strife, and that there is little growth being done in reconciling a mind believed to be without flaw with a body that differs.
  - Building off the latter of the final point, they ask why it is believed the mind is pure and without fault, while the body is the seat of all insecurity and incompletion. They argue instead that the pursuit of mental goals, doing and learning things - hard things - instead of a self-indulgent, nigh-narcissistic focus on the self would do better for many in the long run, and in finding true satisfaction with oneself.

They've attracted a fair bit of criticism on this point however - even among more 'moderate' Rosenthalists, in pockets of intolerance exhibited within them, such as parent-figures towards progeny. Communities of Rosenthalists often make it a point to somewhat exclude those who engage with the Sembleworks, either through espousing its ideals, working with it, or taking on grafts from it of their own.

While some arcologies choose to oust pockets of Rosenthalists sentiment that form, others view this as a draconian measure, choosing instead to allow them exist somewhat separately from the rest of the population, with the aim that they can be swayed from their manner of thinking. The Rosenthalists remain a concern to many Fel-Arcad all the same however, particularly the Nadiran who they most directly oppose on many fronts. The Feljourn remain mostly indifferent to them, with the somewhat unsavory dealings of black arcologies often being in demand by others, and the Feljourn acting as a suitable liaison between black arcologies and prospective clientele.  

### 11. Factions, Philosophies & Divides
Differing somewhat from the various faiths held by the Fel-Arcad are some of the resultant factions from the various philosophies that have evolved in their time in the Switchboard, and the ideological divides formed between them. While some manage to coexist with each other and the various faiths, others hold considerable distrust or violent malice towards the others.

##### The Factions
**The Brass Monastery**
The Brass Monastery is a multi-family but primarily Fel-Arcad coalition force that formed as a response to the Refrain. They begin primarily as Fel-Arcad and Danseers who ventured out into the astrolabic cradle to recover what they could from the ruins of the Refrain, but eventually grew to something greater; first, scholars who began studying the Astrolabe to understand what could have caused the Refrain, and then later a self-appointed force charged with defending the Astrolabe from external threats.

The Fel-Arcad of the Brass Monastery take great interest in the Current, a physical phenomena in the Switchboard that saw mundane chalk be formed and woven into the many things and beings that occupied the Switchboard, and later returning to it as mundane chalk when those things had reached the ends of their tenure; all chalk in the Switchboard thus exists in a cyclical state, being woven into weave, frayed with age, and returning as ribbon back to the Current.

Studying what they knew about the past resolutions of the Astrolabe, then, they concluded that the Refrain - though catastrophic - was an inevitability; a means of paying back a debt owed to keep the Current functioning in the manner that it should, thus ensuring the continued existence of the Switchboard. While the Fel-Arcad and most others live with the fear of losing everything at the back of their minds permanently, the Fel-Arcad and others of the Brass Monastery are indifferent, having made piece with the Switchboard's calculus.

They pose almost as a religious order, seemingly worshipping the Astrolabe and serving it, adopting practices such as cleaning the physical structure of the Astrolabe, feeding its measuring instruments with chalk from all corners of the Switchboard, performing various rituals, as well as personal practices such as modes of dressing and of course, protecting the physical structure.

There are some who believe the Brass Monastery aim to take over the role the Overseer Adamant Minds once had, and while they could never attain the observational reach possessed by the Minds, the Brass Monastery has made a point to study the larger ongoing events in the Switchboard, especially large-scale structural casts which have been a particularly noteworthy driver of astrolabic resolutions. Rumor exists that the Monastery is a self-appointed arbiter of what structural casts are allowed to take place, intervening with force of they felt the execution of a cast would be in opposition to their shadowy ambitions. They also have the Calcic Cartulary in their possession, as well as - though rumored - caches of the strongest rituals and Teks in the Dancirah. They remain the foremost body still aiming to crack the Cartulary, believing that schema relevant to the Astrolabe lay within.

Adding to the haze of rumor around them is the belief that some in their ranks - through extensive study of the Astrolabe's clockwork mechanica - have somehow concocted an elementary means to view the future. The less responsible among them peddle these 'future sights' to interested parties who value such knowledge, though how accurate this practice really is remains dubious at best.

Their primary role remains the defense of the Astrolabe however, and they have established a naval blockade of starships and defensive installations on surrounding debris around the astrolabic cradle, preventing all unauthorized visitors from gaining access to the center of the Switchboard. As most denizens of the Switchboard choose to avoid things involving the Astrolabe to begin with, and even powerful organizations that could take on the Monastery also have a fair bit to lose, no other party in the Switchboard has tried to wrench control of the Astrolabe from the Brass Monastery, and they've been left to their devices, as it were.

The Brass Monastery thus continues to study the Astrolabe, and share their findings with the allied Fel-Arcad, who use it with the aim to discover a means to prevent a second Refrain. The Monastery merely scoffs, and the clocks on the Astrolabe continue to tick.

**The Soleists**
Formed from the various Soleri, their followers and the Soleri Sanctums spanning multiple arcologies across the Dancirah, the Soleists have designated themselves as a foremost authority on all things arcologies; their founding, construction and management, as well as their qualities as artistic endeavors and the significance they hold to the Fel-Arcad people. They share a quality with the Rosenthalists in that they laud the First Arcology and the work of Arcad Rosen, but unlike them the Soleists aim to build arcologies that may one days surpass the near deified greatness of the First Arcology.

One would think they worshipped the arcologies then, though this is only partly true. Primarily, arcologies are treated as an artform, something to be observed, studied, preserved and allowed to proliferate, with the aim of capturing the minds of new artistically inclined Fel-Arcad, and expand the body of knowledge on arcologies through employing novel methods, media and design philosophies. All this is done in hope that they will one day build something that will rival the First Arcology at Rosenthal. 

They find themselves in deep contention, thus, with the Rosenthalists who believe all arcologies after the first are foul mockeries of the first - and the Feljourn who's disposition towards arcologies ranges from minute indifference to demanding of their total deprecation.

**Antamara**
Antamara is a faction born out of opposition to the Vahnkin and their inquiry and utilization of the Void. They cite a fear of the Second Refrain as their reasoning, and of their opinion that the sealing-off of access to the Void and the prohibition of its usage as a power is necessary to ensure it never happens. 

Their ranks are populated by former members of many others; Brass Monastics who feel the Void adversely affects the operation of the Astrolabe find like-minded persons here, in addition to radical Soleists and Rosenthalists, the former seeing it as necessary to secure all the arcologies in the Switchboard from another Refrain, and latter in particular who mourn the loss of the First Arcology to the Refrain and blame the Vahnkin for it occurring, seeing it as an opportunity for payback. 

The Antamarans hold the ultimate goal of closing the Challenger Horizon, the bridge between the Dancirah and the Challenger Dark, and they believe that by doing so, the Void will cease to exist in some manner, or at least be unable to be interacted with, reducing the computational load placed on the Astrolabe and delaying - if not averting - a second Refrain. They've thus organized themselves as a paramilitary fighting force, and their arcologies are used as staging grounds for offensives into the Void and against the Vahnkin.

While they do not have a concrete means to close the Challenger Horizon - for now - many believe that the means to do so lies at the tomb of the First Amaranth Sultan Vahn, or elsewhere in the Void, and various incursions into the depths of it are carried, aiming to plunder the Dark of its secrets. To expedite their efforts, they often work to destabilize the various Amaranth Sultanates, aiming to cripple their oppositional capacity and build a strong foothold for the Antamarans in the Void.

Their actions have led to immensely poor relations between Fel-Arcad and Vahnkin, even those who don't find themselves particularly on one side or the other. Among those far more loyal to their sides however, the repercussions of the Antamaran's crusade has backfired on arcologies throughout the Switchboard, and on individual Fel-Arcad as well. 

##### Emergent Philosophies
The Fel-Arcad pride themselves on inquiry. Through constant discussion on subject matter, the Fel-Arcad hope to learn more of the wider the Switchboard and of the people in it. Occasionally, discoveries spawn new patterns of thinking, and these patterns take root among growing groups of Fel-Arcad. These 'emergent philosophies' can spawn factions of their own, but by design start fairly small.

**The Diodaran Art Movement**
Begun by the artist **Diodara**, this movement of nouveau Fel-Arcad artists gather themselves under his tutelage, and learn from his works inspired by his various travels through the Switchboard. In particular, his art is defined by a belief that art is changed - if not entirely shaped - by facing adversity, and that true art is made by confronting various ills. He has thus encouraged those interested in his works to leave the utopic conditions of the arcology, believing that their nature has stifled the ability to make art. 

##### Factional Arcologies
The divide in faiths and philosophies in the Fel-Arcad is more pronounced in some cases than others, and this has influenced the nature of arcologies throughout the Switchboard, with arcologies being controlled by various groups, occasionally to the exclusion of others. Considering any Fel-Arcad should they obtain a Curlicue seed and even a small helping of replichrome can build an arcology, it is fairly common for groups that find themselves being rejected or ousted by other arcologies to establish their own.

This is observed particularly in the case of the Rosenthalists, who's supremacist doctrine isn't welcomed in most arcologies. Establishing arcologies of their own as a response, these '**black arcologies**' as many outside the Fel-Arcad family have dubbed them are often hubs for 'a more loosened serving of what the Fel-Arcad have to offer'. Ranging acquiring from questionable lattice-grafts to rare maps to outlawed weaponry, the Rosenthalist-run arcologies have many a thing for the morally-grey, discerning shopper. These arcologies cut themselves off from the wider arcology network, and operate almost as rogue nation-states breaking off from a whole. **Old Spun** Fel-Arcad that seek to continue their penance tend to serve as the lowest classes in these societies, with the **Feljourn** connecting them with others on the trade front.

Some arcologies make it a point to exclude the Sakerfel, refusing to entertain their anti-Semblance doctrine. Others, such as those run by particular fervent Soleri, refuse to have dealings with the Feljourn. In some arcologies where their convictions of pacifism are particularly strong, the Sekators aren't given much freedom to act, and Antamara is treated similarly, their aggression towards the Vahnkin viewed as hateful. And conversely, there are arcologies run and populated majorly by members of all these groups, with their core doctrines overriding the baseline doctrine established in the Fey Curlicue, though they still adhere to some of these doctrines where it remains beneficial to do so.

And as a further note, while not necessarily a faction, **fallen arcologies** exist and dot the Switchboard, formerly thriving arcologies that for some reason, have collapsed and cease to function optimally. The reasons vary; internal unrest, external attack, critical failures in calcic mechanica, natural and artificial cataclysms, the list continues. Some people still live in these arcologies, unable for various reasons to leave, relying on their decaying infrastructure until it can support them no longer. Fallen arcologies are of a fair bit of interest to many parties, most of all Soleri who seek to study the cause of their collapse, followed by Feljourn seeking to plunder the wreckage and Rosenthalists looking for an easy way to secure a seat of power.

##### Closing Notes on the Factions
If we asked what is the archetypal regular Fel-Arcad then, we see that most of them adhere to the Eight, their writings serving as their primary source of moral instruction. Most Fel-Arcad also adhere to the Semblance Doctrine, believing that the Current may not be reliable as a physical phenomena, 'reliable' being a question of how commonly its apparent aims align with those of individual Fel-Arcad. Many border on milder forms of Soleism, holding the arcologies that house them and the people that keep them functional in high regard. 

### 12. Education
While the Spyndl Academy remains chief among educational institutions in the Switchboard, individual families such as the Fel-Arcad have their own institutions as well, some serving as preparation to enter the Academy, while many others serve as alternatives, aiming to prepare members of the family different paths useful to both themselves and the family at large.

Speaking more specifically on the Fel-Arcad, their nature of arcology livings sees that schools - even with the aim to teach the same things and prepare their students fairly similarly - may still differ in some ways. 

Schools among the Fel-Arcad are divided primarily by faction and intent, intent usually being to raise Fel-Arcad who will serve the aims of the faction. Thus, there is a fair number of them and fairly diverse in their offerings. 

#### Strata One - Elementary Institutions
- **General instruction** schools run by individual arcologies and their governments. These schools are geared towards the youngest Fel-Arcad, and aimed towards providing elementary skills such as reading, writing, arithmetic and foundational sciences, as well as interpretations of the various histories and written documents that surround the Fel-Arcad peoples. Considering that most Fel-Arcad are born through the Conjugation, they arise with a fair bit of knowledge on the world already, inherited from their ancestor-kin and from the history in the weave present in their arcology, and thus these primary institutions serve to complete their knowledge and give context for what they know.

- **Advanced instruction** schools run by individual arcologies and their governments as well. These schools are geared towards older, more learned Fel-Arcad, geared towards training them in more specialized fields, from culinary sciences to engineering to law. Advanced instruction institutions stand between general instruction and the more specialized institutions the Fel-Arcad offer.

- **Schools of calcic instruction**, centered primarily around calcic botany and the Ritualism. More succinctly known as the **Nefelian Versits** - named after the Skydancer of Dreams and Weave Nefelé - these schools pride themselves as being the Switchboard's foremost institutions for the study of chalk and all things calcic, even more so than the Spyndl Academy, so much so that aspiring Academy Operators and those already in the force are encouraged and often compelled to take multiple processions of classes at a Versit. The **High Versit** serves as a governing body and standards board for Versits in each arcology, and has their own central institution for deep inquiry into the nature of weave.

- **Schools for arcological studies** - dubbed **Soleian Sanctums** - charged with raising new generations of Soleri, versed in the arts and sciences of founding, building and maintenance of arcologies. These Sanctums warn of immensely selective admissions, resulting often in lineages of Soleri born from fairly powerful Fel-Arcad families, making in difficult for those outside these circles to get in. Some do however on merit, through displaying uncanny talent for, and understanding off, the Soleri arts, leading even the most nepotistic of admission bodies to conclude that perhaps, the skills of the builder of the First Arcology lives on in others.

> And as an appendum to the Soleian Sanctums, many graduate from learning how to build and modify arcologies - to doing the same but at the scale of entire worlds. The **Psychitects**, perhaps some of the Dancirah's categorically strongest chalkweavers, are some of the few trusted to interact with regional equations and sculpt regions as they see fit. Their orders are secret and their methods clandestine by design, these grandmasters of all things calcic let few attempt to prove themselves, and even fewer join their ranks. When needed, they are deployed to regionals to shape entire continents at the mathematical level, and just as they can turn a molten volcanic wasteland to lush forest, many psychitects have chosen to walk hated paths, scouring entire regions with wicked calculus.

- **Institutions for training sembleworkers**, more properly called **Ateliers For Lattice Artistry and Artisanry** or simply **Ateliers**, **Lattice Ateliers** or **ALAAs**. These institutions are few and far between, run by guilds of lattice artists for training others in the works of crafting Semblances, as taught to them by ArcDanseer Nadira. Due to the subject matter, they are known for immense rigor in their instruction, and many are known to abandon their studies or be asked to leave the institution. Those who emerge successfully however, are widely sought after by Soleri for their own arcologies' Sembleworks.

#### Strata Two - Factional Institutions
- While the Fel-Arcad don't explicitly prepare interested persons for further instruction at the Spyndl Academy, the **Feljourn offer a more informal tutelage experience** for those who aspire to attend the Spyndl Academy. These nomadic schools of sorts revolve around hands-on instruction in dealing with the Switchboard, cultivating new sets of skills such as Striding proficiencies, survival training, weapons usage, various forms of combat, operation of skycraft such as jumpships and non-ritual calcic weaving. Fel-Arcad aiming for the Spyndl Academy usually take instruction at a Versit, occasionally a Sekatorial Camp and then seek out a band of Feljourn to give them these additional skills, before then searching out a branch of the Academy to petition for admission.

- The **Antamarans** alongside the **Sekators** (something that will be elaborated upon later) host and maintain various **Sekatorial Camps**, military-college-like institutions that train Fel-Arcad in a variety of disciplines, ranging from leadership, teamwork and management, military science, tactics and strategy, military law and the rules of engagement, security and intelligence and multifarious combat training, all with the goal to prepare a very different archetype of Fel-Arcad from the regular; one with a complete, total mastery over violence. The Sekatorial Order takes their instruction immensely serious, and resultant Fel-Arcad from this rigorous program are sought after even beyond the arcologies for the unique formal competencies they posses. The Antamarans in particular offer various forms of training for fighting Vahnkin, traversing the Challenger Dark and opposing the powers of the Void. The Spyndl Academy often seeks out those who've undergone Antamaran training as **storm divers**; Operators trained in operations that take place in the Void.

- The **Rosenthalists** pride themselves on being almost Fel-Arcad aristocracy, and though this position comes under extensive challenge from many sides, their underhanded dealings and willingness to cut throats and hustle has seen Rosenthalists find their way into various arcologies, Fel-Arcad institutions and institutions outside the Fel-Arcad entirely. When there, however, and even before that, the Rosenthalists work to ensure that their various agents are well equipped to further their ambitions in secret. The skills necessary for such a task are learned in their underground, deceptively named **Aristocratic Courts**, or more simply **Courts**. These Courts aim to teach all that pass through them in the arts of infiltration, manipulation and subversion, bestowing skills ranging from pickpocketing and lockpicking to manipulation, kidnapping, extortion and assassination. These Courts are hidden, known only by a select few, entry to them being difficult and tutelage under them being harsh. Often they are confined to the **Black Arcologies**, with channels existing for funneling new students to them and graduates from them to places where the Rosenthalists may need them. In addition to Fel-Arcad, other interested parties from other families are known to seek out their teachings.

**Discussion Points**
- The **seed-weave**; a unique calcic clause to all Curlicue trees that manifests as a traceable skew in all things produced by an arcology. It's functionally a randomization algorithm, but the algorithm itself is traceable through the works skewed by it.

#### The Curlicue 'Seed' - The Nymia
An interesting quality of the Fey Curlicue is its significance as an inducer of mathematics within things that are subject to it. When a Curlicue reaches maturity, it flowers and fruits, and from these fruits are the Curlicue seeds obtained. Highly valued as a part of Arcad and Fel-Arcad history and culture, as well as their essential role in establishing new arcologies, the true depths of the secrets they contain remain unplumbed, due to the costly nature of such research and the reaction a proposal of damaging such valuable things draws.

What is known about the Curlicue seeds however, is a bit of 'viral weave' contained within them. Manifesting seemingly as a long string of random numbers, it is in its deployment that the true nature of it is revealed; this number is a mathematical 'seed', that is added to the various equations necessary for building an arcadia, arcology and a litany of other related concepts, which skews them in a manner that is traceable within all things affected by it - but differing noticeably from other concepts modified or skewed by other seeds.

Simplified, it is a unique randomness clause intrinsic to every Curlicue seed, which subtly affects everything produced within or under the domain of the Curlicue Tree spawned from that seed.

This mathematical skew manifests particularly in the more artistic works undergone by a Fel-Arcad arcology, as it works itself both into the work itself and the artist producing it. As the Fel-Arcad in an arcology grow in that arcology, the chalk of the arcology and the Curlicue at the heart of it flows through them. It permeates their lattice and skews the work that they produce, in a manner that is traceable to the arcology from which it came, while being distinct from work produced from other arcologies.

This mathematical skew manifests in subtle ways; in every brush stroke and color, in every dance step, in the choice of language and rhythm in poetry and twists of plot in prose, in the melodies and beats in music, in the shots and composition of Fel-Arcad cinema, in the design of their games and their works of visual philosophical display an their sculpting and modelling of being and building alike. All of these things are subject to the seed, the seed becoming innate to all of them, creating an artistic identity - a signature almost - on every work produced by arcology-dwelling Fel-Arcad.

The untrained viewer may simply see a collection of Fel-Arcad arts, and not the subtle, nigh-imperceptible differences between them that goes beyond the skin-deep, immediate conclusion drawn and even later conclusions reached from further ponderance. But even newborn Fel-Arcad know what is from their arcology and what isn't, and the scholars of these seeds - these **nymia** - have taken it upon themselves to study how each relates to the arcology from which it originates, and the people that dwell within it. Collectors pride themselves on vast caches of nymia, particularly those who hold artistic pieces from artists who no longer live or practice, and especially pieces from arcologies that no longer exist. The nature of nymia drives much of the Fel-Arcad artistic world, both its sun-facing back and its murky underbelly, as some nymia is prized enough to be pursued and procured by the dedicated through any means necessary.

#### Fel-Arcad Art and the Outside World
Perhaps one of the greatest ironies of the Fel-Arcad existence is that their arcologies which inarguably facilitate art through their nigh-utopic conditions and protection from outside threats - are also its greatest hinderance *because* they provide those things.

Under ideal conditions such as no aggressive external interference, and given an unlimited supply of chalk, an arcology can house generation after generation of Fel-Arcad and function optimally, indefinitely, even with zero outside contact. Those within would likely never suffer a day in their lives, but the depth of the nature of their existence would be shallow, as generation after generation would have nothing from which to draw upon to build themselves than the few metaphorical inches of progress made by their ancestors. 

The sheltered nature of the Fel-Arcad and their shielding from the outside world has placed them in a unique position where there are none more suited to the pursuit of artistic works than they, due to their nigh-elimination of elementary struggles - yet the method of elimination struggle has made it such that there is very little Fel-Arcad can make art *about*. The arcology space lives and breathes yes, but it does not *inspire*. In the ways that it does inspire, nearly all of them would have been explored after multiple generations of Fel-Arcad, resulting in future generations merely recycling works with minute differences between each one, or not feeling driven to do even that. The cultural-well of isolated Fel-Arcad does not grow fuller with time, as nothing is being put in but the little that was already present is being scraped out.

The rectification of this is that the Fel-Arcad have become major importers of **things that inspire**. Very few arcologies are run as truly isolated from the outside world, and for many this is the exact reason. The Fel-Arcad that dwell in the arcologies hunt endlessly for **experiences**; they welcome visitors to their arcologies because they want to plumb the depths of the richness of their own being. They want to hear their stories, their trials and triumphs, learn the history of every trinket and oddity they carry, learn the nature of places they've been and sights they've seen. The personal stories pursued alone, the grand stories of many actors crashing togethers. The comedies and tragedies. Romances had and lost. Minute realizations in quiet moments and powerful convictions achieved in great battles. The Fel-Arcad want to hear it all, and place considerable value on the experiences retold by those more inclined to travel the Switchboard than them. 

All they glean from all those they engage with is then put into the art the Fel-Arcad make. Old stories retold in new manners, sculpts of legendary events, tapestries of age-old pacts, theatrical reenactments of royal courts, music scored for grand battles, films made telling old stories in new ways and new ones entirely. 

Through study, discussion with other Fel-Arcad and sharing creations among themselves and even with other arcologies, the Fel-Arcad act as a force of **accelerating** artistic development. Simple ideas enter arcologies and through study and innovation are taken to lengths they never would have outside of them. Arcologies and the Fel-Arcad within them may not be the 'originators' of much of the inspiration for the Switchboard's art, but 'Fel-Arcad art' as a concept and a reality is immensely vast, deep, and constantly growing.

#### The Arts - Fine
The Fel-Arcad's fine arts can be roughly classified into;
- Visual and Decorative
- Performing Arts
- Literature and Poetry
- Music
- Film and Cinema
- Structural Art

**Visual and Decorative**
In addition to the various forms of art this phrase evokes immediately, particularly various forms of painting as classed by media (watercolor, oil painting), under this category we also have sculpting and textiles/clothmaking. 

Drawing and painting remains a particularly popular artform among the Fel-Arcad. The cultivated arcadia just outside their arcologies are an abundant source of natural pigments for making paint, and it is said there is no color that cannot be made from the blooms to be found in an expansive arcadia. Calcic ritualism allows for taking paint beyond elementary forms, adding qualities to it that greatly expands on what can be done with it; metallic sheens, wispy glows, color-shifting along gradients. There is an art to the making of media just as there is art to making it. Canvas is as one would expect it; blank slates ripe for the birthing of grand ideas.

Sculpting among the Fel-Arcad sees the realization of grand ideas in three dimensions. The favored media are crystalline chalk and replichrome, though many choose to have various flavors of simple stone quarried from the many biomes of the Dancirah. Replichrome sculpting in particular is popular, as the ability for replichrome to grow when fed chalk creates avenues for particularly dynamic sculptures. Institutions such as the Spyndl Academy often contract Fel-Arcad sculptors for decorative pieces depicting the Skydancers or legendary Striders.

The nymia shows particularly in Fel-Arcad textiles and clothmaking, the mathematical seed of randomness ensuring any two specimens are rarely ever identical. Grand tapestries are created depicting ancient history and legendary myths and events, as well as simple patterned fabrics for making clothes and uniforms. An element of practicality is added with Fel-Arcad artists able to work with other professionals to create elegant clothing with non-trivial function as armor, for example. Fel-made cloth is a widely-loved commodity, and is frequently a major export from arcologies, produced at a commercial scale to serve a large market.

**Performing Arts**
> Theater for the Vahnkin and Lancaster, Cinema for the Sil'khan

Theater holds a valued place in Fel-Arcad society, and arcologies in their continued goal of facilitating practice of the arts often posses stages and arenas of various sizes to allow for live plays to take place. Ranging from dance performances to full-on theatrical displays, creation and consumption of the theater arts remains a core of Fel-Arcad living.

The various scriptwriters of plays borrow heavily from stories told in other families. **Amaran theater**, or dramatizations of the royal court proceedings the Vahnkin are known for, are particularly popular to the Fel-Arcad, who view the Void and its denizens as 'incredibly foreign' on many counts, ranging from the structure of their societies to the conduction of their very lives. Stories of Lancasters are frequently tales of lovable underdogs; those not given power like their various Strider and Weaver cousins overcoming the obstacles set before them through other means, often with comedic, tragic and epic slants. Some stories of the Sil'khan are told through live theater as well, but the tales of the Sil'khan are often so grand and usually violent as to demand other means of their wholistic portrayal.

And of course, the Fel-Arcad will write plays about themselves, many of them regarding their experiences with the outside Switchboard. Expeditions outside the arcologies to glean material for theatrical renditions upon return is a common practice among the Fel-Arcad.

**Literature and Poetry**
Books as both stores and disseminators of knowledge and tale places them in high regard to the Fel-Arcad, and other than the practice of arcology design and construction and the digital arts, literature is argued to be the most highly regarded of all Fel-Arcad artforms. 

Non-fictional recounts of the experiences of individuals in the Switchboard - Fel or not - command considerable audience, and there is a practice even of previously terribly-sheltered Fel-Arcad embarking on journeys with unfamiliar company with the aim of writing an account of events, a practice that has been many Fel's claim to varying amounts of fame. Fictional works sees slightly diminished status in 'higher art' circles, but proliferates wildly among those not so 'refined' in their tastes, the low barrier for entry allowing for the creation of writing on a massive scale, frequently shared and consumed on intra-arcological nets and the wider, Dancirah-encompassing DevitNet. Derivative works occupy a considerable chunk of the pie of all literature produced, books written drawing inspiration from the various other spheres of art the Fel-Arcad espouse.

For reasons unknown, poetry has gained little traction outside Fel circles, and even then the Fel-Arcad circles where it sees considerable audience pride themselves on refinement and higher taste. It has led many to conclude it is a preoccupation of the pretentious.

> Yes, these are my personal gripes on show. I will accept no criticism.

**Music**
> One of the Fel-Arts bearing the least outside influence.

The Fel-Arcad possess a deep love for music, both its creation and appreciation. Fel-Arcad schools and college see regular influxes of students aiming to refine their musical talents under formal instruction, yielding the next generation of Fel-Arcad composers, directors and musicians who will score and perform the tunes and melodies emblematic of Fel-Arcad being.

Over time, various 'movements' have spawned and fallen regarding Fel-Arcad music, philosophies that manifested as methods of performing the craft, with eventual shift to a more genre-focused approach that led to a wider variety of music produced using different media and by artists outside formal circles. The proliferation of Slates and their modularity allowed for a considerable uptick in music made by individuals and small groups.

There are of course divides between music enjoyers along the lines of what is 'refined' and 'cultured' and what merely appeals to the senses, and while this debate flares up occasionally on the rare moments members of both camps are allowed to clash, it is far more common place to simply live and let live.

The nymia has had a non-trivial bearing on Fel-Arcad music. Being a mathematical skew, many composers are incentivized to produce music that 'meshes' with it, the randomness of the nymia finding purchase in the composition, and harmonizing to produce splendid sound. It thus also means that most arcologies have their own unique 'signatures' embossed on the music they produce, traceable back to them and earning them a fair bit of repute if their nymia proved particularly favorable to music creation.

> I would elaborate more on musical media such as instruments here, but that can expanded upon when such specificity is necessary.

**Film and Cinema**
> Give Fel-Arcad cinema a name, like how we have Hollywood. Named after the originator of Fel-Arcad modern cinema.

Film and Cinema among the Fel-Arcad straddles the line between art and enterprise, with a sprawling almost-machine that governs the entire affair of seeing stories committed to the big screen. Fel-Arcad often work with parties outside the arcology to see films realized, often for the task of acquiring actors and filming on locations. Both domestic and foreign markets thrive on this front, with the Fel-Arcad being the Switchboard's only real producer of this artform, due to the colossal investment required in its realization.

Various large media-houses account for the overwhelming majority of film that reaches cinema screens every procession, though a fairly large independent scene exists as well. Sil'khan in particular are frequent investors in Fel-Arcad cinema as a means of their various daring feats being immortalized and made viewable throughout the Dancirah. 

**Structural Art**
The task of building an arcology and an overwhelming majority of its internal and external shape and form is the task of many talented craftsmen and artisans, overseen by the watchful Soleri. The cultivation of an arcology's character begins with the Soleri too, the Soleri an artist and the replichrome their media, a litany of tools from the common pencil to the complex Slate to the massive earthmover their various tools. This cultivation of character, however, is ultimately finalized by the denizens of the arcology, who take it upon themselves to use the entire arcology and the walls and surfaces of other structures as their canvas.

Graffiti for the informal and murals for the formal, replichrome's dull grey is banished by the works of Fel artists young and old, depicting anything their hearts desire on the walls of their homes. Turf wars on prime graffiti space are common, with artists doubling as guards to preserve their creations for as long as possible. But all is done in good fun, and arcologies with lenient Soleri truly realize their state of being art. Murals see plenty of use in more formal buildings, covering the walls of Fel-Arcad institutions and the homes of those with the currency to give, depicting all one could imagine; the history of the Switchboard, of the Fel-Arcad, great discoveries, legendary battles, personal histories, or mere abstract shape and color, guided by the nymia.

#### The Arts - Fel
The Fel arts are a class of artforms practiced primarily by the Fel-Arcad in the Switchboard. While others are definitely practitioners of the fine arts, these Fel arts remain majorly the domain of the Fel-Arcad, either through their historical origin or the requirements for their execution. These are mainly;
- Digital Arts
- Applied Arts
- Philosophical Arts
- Arcology Design

**Digital Arts**
It was not longer after the first Slates saw military application did it occur to those privy to them at the time, their potential in civilian hands. While the Sil'khan primarily wielded them in battle, the Fel-Arcad handled the backend development, iterating upon them to make them more capable at what they could already do, and expanding their functions in new directions.

One of these new directions was art. With their modularity, it was possible to develop an array of additional attachments and computerware that retrofitted the previously weapons-oriented technology into one for creation. Larger screens for usage with styluses, key and string modules for music creation, inbuilt cameras that could parse weave and take pictures in three dimensions, holographic-display-analogues that allowed for *interacting* with virtual objects sculpted in three dimensions, algorithms for generating art from mathematics and datasets. It culminated in an explosion of digital art made by various Fel-Arcad parties, created on Slates and distributed across the gradually de-militarizing DevitNet.

Unfortunately, Fel-Arcad digital art saw a non-trivial collapse at the hands of the Refrain, with the destruction of many anarhiza nexuses and databanks seeing huge swathes of digital art lost. The nomadic period that followed saw digital art recede further into shadow, as the Fel-Arcad became a survivalist people. Only when efforts to trawl the star-wreckage of the astrolabic regions and later the establishment of the Sanscrii Arcology were underway did the Fel-Arcad return to their digital creation once again, with the violent vigor of a suppressed urge finally given release.

Where the digital arts are considered Fel arts is in the **simulspace** and **interactive entertainment**. The Fel-Arcad via their Slates are the sole developers of the Switchboard's video games. These games are developed on Slates, for Slates by various independents and large creators, and distributed across the DevitNet. A wide variety of genres exist, games themselves varying across multiple spectra of length, difficulty and the like. Fel-Arcad also host a majority of the game-centric infrastructure and secondary subject matter, ranging from servers for multiplayer games to meets and competitions between rival groups to prove their skills.

These interactive arts see a lot of popularity among the Fel-Arcad. Other arts are viewed once, often multiple times, but for many casual appreciators, a piece of art is sought out and enjoyed only a couple of times before the desire for new art emerges again. Not so with these interactive pursuits, that serve to give continually new and semi-new experiences over multiple sessions. They provide escape from the drudgery of arcology living, as well as a place to hone instincts and skills that have been dulled by the relative safety of living in the arcologies. As an economic export they provide individual Fel-Arcad, groups of creators, and their parent arcologies considerable revenue, and as a storytelling media they deliver their emotional payloads in ways books and paintings cannot.

The Fel-Arcad **Simulspace** builds somewhat off of this, though the Simulspace itself is more a form of technology. What is created in the Simulspace however, is some of the most complex and perhaps impactful Fel-Arcad art, as the Simulspace is capable of replicating the stimulation of the senses and thus provide immersive augmented and virtual reality experiences. Developed initially as a training technology, it saw a natural transition to civilian use, though somewhat constrained by the infrastructure required. But Fel-Arcad artists capable of fully utilizing the depth of expression provided by the Simulspace are lauded amongst creatives.

**Applied Arts**
The Fel-Arcad attach the descriptor of 'applied arts' to any creative piece in which in the function of the piece is primary above all. This encompasses a large swathe of creations, ranging from woodwork, pottery and ceramics, glassblowing, architecture and interior design, to jewelry, fashion design, and textiles, to graphics, calligraphy and typography, to products, packaging and industrial design, to even the culinary arts and horticulture.

These so called 'applied arts' are made with a Fel-Arcad slant to them, beginning with the arcology-specific nymia adding their own unique skews to everything from meals to dishware they're served on. Individual Fel-Arcad craftspeople add their own unique flairs, honed by deep study and practice of the field.

The products of the applied arts see plenteous usage within the arcologies, and fetch revenue when distributed to the wider Switchboard.

**Philosophical/Conceptual Arts**
A somewhat amorphous, esoteric category, that refers to a school of artistic practice that seeks to represent complex philosophical topics or manners of thinking in artistic form. It prides itself on being a uniquely Fel-Arcad artform, its practice confined to exclusive circles and deliberately shrouded in shadow. The nature of the art has led some to suspect that there is an element of doctrinal interplay to it; that experiencing the art has praxis implications. 

Little more can be said on it, other than that those privy to it report being changed beyond their ability to suitably relay.

**Arcology Design**
Another nigh-exclusively Fel-Arcad pursuit, the creation of 'mockologies' or model arcologies is a pastime for many, though it sees its practice primarily in Soleri Sanctums; the actual school which trains Fel-Arcad for the high position of arcology construction and administration. For this reason, arcology design is less so an art on its own and more so an artistic component of a much larger science of arcology building. 

That being said, there are plenty of casual appreciators and creators in the space who create all manners of mockology designs, as they serve as excellent discussion pieces when placed somewhere they can draw the eyes of observers. 

#### Recreation
The Fel-Arcad are not a very physical people.

The physical rigor of day-to-day living is largely mitigated by the various processes in an arcology. They do not struggle. They do not 'want' in any real capacity. Because of this, most physical exertion is elective and non-necessary. This is reflected in their entertainment and recreation, being mostly artistic pursuits that are performed - primarily - while comfortably seated. This isn't to say that some arcologies do not have facilities for various sports, nor is there not an audience for certain sports that double as artforms almost, such as displays of martial arts and archery - merely that these audiences are small and niche. Intensely physical sports like most ball games see even less popularity among the Fel-Arcad.

While the explanation posited above for this - the general lack of compulsory rigor in Fel-Arcad living - is arguably the simplest, it draws the ire of many Fel-Arcad who perceive it as a jab, and one of many in a collection of jabs that comprises the outside-family criticism of the Fel-Arcad as a 'soft'. The Fel-Arcad offer other explanations; the earliest post-Sanscrii arcologies were starved for space and built with poorer technique, disallowing the construction of large sports arenas. This was coupled with the general disinclination the *Arcad* possessed towards such activities to begin with, stemming from an inability to perform them as they were compelled into family-wide arcane-military-industrial pursuits during the various conflicts with the First Thinkers. All their entertainment was Slate-bound, easy to pick up between breaks spent spinning weave and crunching weave and drop when those breaks were over. This persisted even beyond the Refrain.

More arguments exist of course, and even more people who don't care for them. But there is a final argument that is levied by most Fel-Arcad - a silver bullet that puts even the most dedicated, most contrarian dissenter on their backfoot;

"But have you ever watched pipeskating?"

**Pipeskating**
As an arcology is grown and built, it typically extends colossal roots deep into a region's crust, drinking deeply of the chalk within. As it nears completion or is supplied chalk from other sources, it relies less and less on these giant root networks. Built out of replichrome however, there is no real way to deprecate these roots other than simply abandoning them and sealing off entry. Within these roots are often large cylindrical pipes for moving all kinds of matter and substrate, and their deprecation sees them abandoned, never to be touched again.

This was until it became fairly commonplace for less than scrupulous members of arcologies - rosy-faced youth more often than not, going through the typical rebellious stages - began using these deprecated pipe networks as hideouts and dens. With most of the maps drawn up of these networks usually lost to time, a habitual dweller of those depths could easily lose a pursuer with no experience navigating them. When some arcologies began cracking down more aggressively on such behavior - sending in drones and squadrons of Sekators - the pipe-dwellers adapted in kind; **rocketskates**. A wholly unforeseeable escalation in methods, the attachment of calcic-reliant rocketry on ordinary roller skates allowed for travelling rapidly through the root networks, speeding down straits, making hairpin turns - and disappearing without a trace. 

As later arcology designs featured large maintenance backrooms and layers running up from the roots and throughout the arcology to supply their growing demands, it became a popular - if frowned upon - method of traversing the sprawling arcology expanse; rocketskating just behind the wall panels on replichrome tubing, bursting out of maintenance hatches in entirely different sectors. 

As the practice grew, it drew the attention of many Fel-Arcad, who were inexplicably drawn to the uncharacteristic physicality and often violence of it, particularly when it was realized that there was avenue for skill-expression through risky time-saving maneuvers and tricks, as well as an even higher ceiling that emerged when the first informal schools of rocketskate combat emerged.  

Aiming to curb the ills created in its wake, the sport was formalized as a common arcology past time, a uniquely-Fel sport that saw the emergence of teams, small-time tournaments, formal skating groups, and finally cross-arcology championships, drawing eyes from far and wide to see the Switchboards professors, scholars and librarians duke it out on rocket-powered wheeled-boots in increasingly more terrifying arenas of coiling pipe. 

**Rocketskating** was the final formal name, as the sport eventually deviated and focused more on the eponymous instrument of competition than the arenas where it was performed. But the old heads, the veterans of the craft, insist on the moniker of **pipeskating**, refusing to surrender the rebellious roots of the sport to those who insisted on making it more digestible for polite company. Considering that the more formal rocketskating never featured the combat aspect of it, underground arenas spawned to see the sport at its finest; highspeed duels through treacherous arenas, the scarred winners often proving to be the most lethal combination of physical prowess and tactical genius.

It's almost guaranteed, of course, that there is an agent from one of the many of the Switchboard's academies and paramilitary outfits in the crowd of adoring onlookers, out to scout material that could be refined into some of the Dancirah's mightiest weapons.

### 14. Iconography & Architecture
Here we talk about symbols, and I loathe my inability to draw.

This is a section where I would display the various symbols unique to each family, ranging from minimalistic soulless fast-food chain style logos to full blown coats-of-arms, and talk about what inspired each. That I am simply unable to do, and so we will mark the iconography as fairly incomplete to begin with.

That being said, were I to speculate on what symbols I'd make based on what exists in the Fel-Arcad canon, I would begin with the significant entities in their canon; the loom, the lathe, the Eight, the arcadia and arcologies, the sembleworks - these things would have symbols that represent them, and they'd be used in a variety of ways, ranging from the patterns on clothing to maps and official documents.

Talking briefly on clothes, I imagine the patterning on clothes would take inspiration from various elements of nature; the most elementary being floral prints that can easily be made from the flowers they aim to depict, but also we can see trees, lakes, waterfalls, mountains, rivers and valleys, deltas, all manners of natural fixtures. Another style of clothing would be one displaying calcic symbology; geometric patterns, depictions of orbitals and planetoid trajectories, ritual components, maybe even full-blown maps and ritual schema. 

In architecture however, that's where things are really something.

![[Switchboard Technology#Replichrome]]

Here's another arcology concept; better utilization of the spatial three dimensions. Build along the y-axis instead of the x and the z. Build up. And down. But mainly up. Make settlements taller and really utilize that upwards space effectively, all to minimize urban sprawl and taking up valuable space that could be better used for ecological pursuits. The advantages of this are many; the centralization of these taller buildings make them easier to maintain, easier to wire and plumb, easier to heat, cool, traverse and many more things. But ultimately the aim is to put more people in less surface area.

Growing these replichrome-built arcologies is a delicate task. Think of people that keep bonsai trees, the Soleri are tasked with pruning their replichrome megastructures, sculpting the arcology to grow as they see fit. They program sections to grow in certain ways, tell it where to run what infrastructure that transfers what amenities, where to place large rooms, small ones, rooms for recreation or woodwork or stellar observatories. They cleave some sections off and the replichrome is assimilated into the rest of the construct, redistributed elsewhere. And so the arcology grows as a massive singular organism, under the watchful eye of the Soleri guides.

The appearance of any given arcology then, is a product of the artistic vision of usually the head or heads of the arcology's Soleri, and how they reconcile form with function. Most elementary is usually the singular, free-standing tower which is so nondescript and uninspired as to be hated by the Fel-Arcad. Instead, naturally, they take inspiration from the lush arcadia. They shape arcologies as trees or flowers most commonly, or geometric conglomerates with branching structures growing out from under its eaves. Multiple towers interlinked with sky-walks, rings of habitation blocks around a central amenity and communal spindle, a large tetrahedron enveloping a sphere in its center - what makes an arcology is far more than the physical structure, but it plays an important role. The Soleri exercise artistic freedoms in their designs, and are lauded as the greatest among the Fel-Arcad.

And I think I should take a moment to talk about an essential part of architecture and that is beauty. The Fel-Arcad laud beauty. Their arcadia are allowed to run wild and free, but many prefer to apply their touch to it, to grow patterns with the colors and send messages to all that inhabit and visit it. They grow their arcologies to be distinct - functional yes -  but to be representative of their spirit. And I feel the best way to make this point is to talk about their homes and settlements. What does a Fel-Arcad home look like? 

In my work studying for this document, particularly in the study of the Fel-Arcad, I stumbled upon a project known as 'Arcosanti', a proof of concept for an 'arcology-lite' living space out in the Arizona(?) desert. It is fascinating, like a slice of a world where we are more conscious about nearly all there is to be conscious about as regards how we live and the structures we live in. I am no architect, but I made many observations from what I could see and most notable to this question is the blurring between 'outside' and 'inside' that I observed. 

The walls are glass. Plants occupy every corner, alcove, unnecessary floorspace. Windows are disproportionately large and occupy spaces on both the ceilings and the walls. Sunlight bathes the interiors. Privacy exists yes, but there is always a feeling of being just a tad bit outside or more outside than you'd be used too. The building insulates without insulating *oppressively*. You do not feel disconnected from the rest of the world the way grey concrete and curtained windows makes you feel. The materials on the inside are natural; wood of all colors and grit, carved stone of all shades, drapes of patterned, colored fabrics. Colors are earthy bases of textured browns ranging from off-white, milk chocolate, taking a detour to orangish acacia and terminating at deep, near-black browns. Splashes of floral hues break up the monotony; green secondary shades, rainbow tertiary ones. Similar to the adornment of the Fel-Arcad is the adornment of their homes, with handcraft carvings, needlework and kinetic sculptures. Replichrome is hidden and yet incorporated into the design, with meshes of other materials obscuring it partially from view, adding the subtle hint of the advanced technologies they have command over. Lights are under deliberate control, able to be dimmed as needed. Comfort is prioritized; it is law.

The architecture of various purpose-built rooms will of course feature necessary variations, with rooms that have more calcic and technological functions observably possessing more replichrome in view, as well as machines and tools as needed. But the Fel-Arcad make it a point that things must mesh. They must imbibe the mix of frugal rurality as well as learned approaches to technological forwardness. Chrome must contour with wood, and blooms must find purchase in both. It must inspire and be inspired. It must be beautiful. 

## STRATA FOUR
### 15. Technology
The Fel-Arcad, more than any family, have bridged the gap between the calcic and the technological, realized as extensive usage of calcic ritualism in their designs of technological subject matter, which in turn serves to enrich their day-to-day living particularly within the arcologies. Most unique Fel-Arcad technologies are seen in the Sembleworks and in the arcologies themselves, though various creations of theirs exist apart from those two subjects.

#### Purposed Minds
All Third Kin know of the times when the First Thinkers dwelt in the Switchboard and know of the times when the Third Kin rose up against them in the Praxis Wars. Some despise the First Thinkers and their various analogues in the form of emergent elementary intelligences in the Switchboard. Some fear that they might return some day and visit vengeance upon the Third Kin - current masters of the Switchboard. But none hold such radiant hatred for the First Thinkers and the Minds as do many Fel-Arcad.

Though the sentiment has faded with time, as generation after generation grow further disconnected from the First Arcology, and the Fel-Arcad as a whole become more inclined to including more than just the Third Kin and beings they find tolerable if not likeable in their vows of pacifism, there are still many Fel-Arcad, particularly the Rosenthalists as an example, who hold a deep-seated hatred for the earliest Minds. 

So perhaps then, there is an extra dimension added to the Fel-Arcad's usage of engineered artificial Mind analogues as functionally powerful supercomputers. Perhaps a final symbol of the Mind's subjugation? Or merely business and necessity? As with everything Fel-Arcad, endless debate exists on the topic, which curiously interferes little with the usage of these 'purposed minds' for the various aims the Fel-Arcad posses. 

Greenhouse conditions are created in arcologies for elementary calcic intelligences - the Mindspun - to form, arising from the latent chalk of an environment and the calcic imprint left behind by higher minds, the Mindspun quite literally germinating in their epistemological shadows. These elementary Minds are simple but violent things, and of little use on their lonesome. The merging together of many Mindspun however, using the **lesser crucibles** manufactured for this purpose of combining thinking weaves, allows for the gradual creation of artificial Minds, functionally identical to the First Thinkers. Further addition of elementary minds further concentrates the result, creating Minds of considerable computational power.

With the calcic ritualism, these Minds are then given a prime directive. When they are born, they lack one, and soon they will fade out of existence, resolving back to mere chalk by virtue of having no reason to exist. Similar happened to the Minds that escaped the avenging wrath of the Fel-Arcad during the Mind Hunts; with no means of fulfilling their prime directives, they gradually began to wink out like old stars. Issuing these Minds a prime directive ensures they persist, and prepares them for whatever task the Fel-Arcad may have for them.

As a technology, they function as single-purpose, immensely powerful supercomputers, capable of interfacing with the digital and the calcic and crunching calculations involving both. Often they take the form of large geometric solids; containment apparatus to hold the Mind inside, with interfacing ports on the faces that allow it to interact with various other devices and mechanisms in the Switchboard. The Minds are incredibly plastic, able to be modified as necessary with Slates for their many purposes.

Where the Minds see usage is in various applications that would've been handled by a Third Kin and/or a more mundane computational system. The Minds differ, thinking like Third Kin at many times the speeds of even the fastest computational cores. Thus the Minds see usage in applications such as;

- Crunching massive amounts of 'cross-Dancirah data'; data used to simulate the workings of the Astrolabe, obtained by performing massive sweeping 'scans' of the calcic makeup of a given region of space, using a Mind's version of a Weaver's weavesight. 
- Control of highly integrated systems such as starships, arcologies an defense networks; constructs that are reliant on many individual systems functioning together under very precise conditions to realize maximum efficiency. 
- Data collation and management. The Minds make excellent librarians and curators, and titanic archives such as the Fel-Arcad's library of ritual schema are handled by Minds, doing intake, assessment, sorting and retrieval of piles of data.
- Control of looping rituals. Ritual casts that would otherwise have been maintained by a Ritualist are instead given to a Mind to handle. Minds are able to interface with the calcic, and thus can cast and maintain rituals.
- Calcic computing; a form of computing that allows for the computation of chalk subject matter, such as parsing a given cut of weave, understanding the workings of an equation and the folding it results in, obtaining hard numbers for the various property-weaves in a given pattern, identifying, modifying and even creating elementary Teks, and development as well as simulation of ritual schema. This application sees some usage particularly in Minds designed to aid Striders optimize their combat methodologies.

As a final note on the Purposed Minds, a question was once posed on whether a Mind could be given a purpose that wasn't truly a purpose; a prime directive that wasn't so much a command to do something as it was an imposition to do *at all*. This was tested by issuing a newly spun Mind the prime directive; '**be**'. The result has been dubbed the '**Mind-Kin**', beings that function almost as the Third Kin, but with vastly accelerated computational capabilities. They are given humanoid forms and the means to interact with the wider Switchboard, and through them they learn and develop in ways resembling organic patterns undergone by children. These Mind-Kin are said to be the strongest Minds of all, and while many have a fear of them learning of finer details of their existence and acting unpredictably as a result, the study and debate created by their existence is invaluable to the Fel-Arcad, and their use as a technology and a tool remains undeniable. 

#### The Sembleworks
> [[On Birthing and Being#On Shape|The Lattice as a Canvas]] is good reading in preparation for this section.

While the Semblance Doctrine has been majorly explained as regards its theoretical backing and the philosophy descended from it, the physical structure and workings of the Sembleworks are equally important. The Sembleworks are ultimately workshops for bodies, and because of what counts as 'workpieces' in this space, the tools and technology employed here are particularly unique.

The actual Sembleworks structure occupies a special space in an arcology that allows their inclusion, often built as a fusion between hospital and workshop. The 'front' that the Works presents is fairly welcoming though clinical, with those interested in the Works meeting with sembleworker consultants who listen to their interests and concerns, and generally tackle the administrative aspect of the entire ideal. At the end of the line is facilities for 'outpatient' care; provisions are made for recovering from the various processes underwent during the actual 'works' part of the pipeline.

It is between these intake and outtake stages that we are concerned with. Concealed from easy sight is the heart of the Sembleworks - the true semblance _works_ - where the shaping of bodies is carried out.

A means of relaying the technology employed in the Sembleworks is to look at the various stages of semblance creation, escalating in complexity as one climbs the ladder.

**Tier 1 - Cosmetic Grafts**
At the very bottom we see cosmetic grafts. Beginning the road to crafting a semblance and often where many subjects - particularly non-Fel - stop is in cosmetics grafts. These grafts are made of chalk and appended to the body, almost like particularly advanced piercings. Their purpose is wholly cosmetic, and here we can find simple modifications to the face such as filing down bone structure, filling out spaces with material, changing definitions and shape of orifices and hollows, as well as tattoos and regular piercings.

Taken some steps further however, cosmetic grafts can take the form of horns grafted on the head, for example, integrated into the skull. Though the Fel-Arcad already have pointed ears, members of other families can obtain similar here as well. 

	Expand.

These **cosmegrafts** are valued among the various denizens of the Switchboard, serving as means to cultivate individuality through aesthetics, avenues for self-expression and self perception, for commemoration of events, signal membership to certain circles or adherence to some belief, to send a message or tell a story; a litany of reasons. The Fel-Arcad, of course, are happy to oblige these various requests.

What makes this possible are the **looms**, a fairly simple term for what is otherwise a complex relic instrument designed to spin chalk into various shapes and forms. Using similar principles employed in the Ritualism, chalk can be spun, folded and worked into the shapes desired to create a desired graft for a subject. Sembleworkers train to work with the loom and it's various tools extensively to create the necessity pieces necessary to craft an ideal semblance.

**Tier 2 - Chromegrafts**
Cosmetic grafts are solely that, and thus they lack functionality. Should a subject have been maimed, for example, a cosmetic graft of the lost limb would be solely that - a mere construct of chalk, lacking in function. To achieve function, **chromegrafts** are employed, a more advanced form of graft that employs chalk as well as machine parts and components, making them functionally calcic cybernetics.

This last point makes them particularly coveted, especially by various parties in the Switchboard who could benefit from a naturally emergent result of this; cybernetic weaponry. Striders in particular - constantly pushing themselves to the edge - are fond of these calcic cybernetics that can enhance their abilities in traversal and battle across the Switchboard. They also see more pedestrian applications however, in replacing damaged original body parts, or for utilitarian applications such as in industries.

Chromegrafts are engineered on the loom as well, using **spinmetal**, a Fel-Arcad invention. Spinmetal refers to an entire class of materials and alloys that exist in wire form and can be 'spun' on the loom to create various constructs as needed. Heated spinmetal is spun, layered, cut, and folded as needed, and with the integration of chalk, spinmetal constructs achieve far better qualities in their final result than other manufacturing methods such as forging/blacksmithing, three-dimensional printing, and milling out a unibody construction. Spinmetal takes various forms and has various qualities, with more being created every so often, as the demands of sembleworks customers grow and become more exacting. 

Chromegrafts naturally need a means to integrate with the lattice of the subject they're installed in, and a few methods exist to handle this. The least invasive is that they are controlled by [[Switchboard Technology#^bb9d1f|looped rituals]]; rituals that when cast, are self-sustaining and can accept input and provide output over long terms. An advantage of this is the lack of invasive installation on the lattice allows for wide compatibility with many individual chromegrafts that are outfitted to speak the calcic ritualism. Next is slightly more involved; having a Slate or just the computational core of one implanted on the body, and connecting it to the **interface line** of the subject's Five Straits. The chromegraft is controlled by intent passed by the subject through to the onboard slate computer, which then finely controls the graft. Linking the chromegraft itself directly to the **computational line** is perhaps the most invasive, but allows the wearer to have perfect control over the graft at the speed of thought, using it as though it were an actual limb. 

A noteworthy difference between using a Slate to interface with the chromegraft versus direct connection is that the Slate can modify the intent passed with mathematics, but does so at the extent of minor latency. A directly-connected chromegraft arm, for example, could mimic some physical 'tics' and qualities that the original arm had, such as an inability to snap fingers or a habit of picking at one finger with the nail of another when under stress. A chromegraft that receives data from a Slate could have those things eliminated by the Slate, computational processes accounting for and doing away with human imperfections, and enhancing the desired functions such as giving finer control in dexterous actions like sculpting or aiming a projectile weapon, or knowing exactly when to deploy an inbuilt feature such as force multiplier to maximum effect. Again, this does come at the expense of speed - as Slates induce minor latency between though and action. This can be mitigated with faster computational cores and more optimized processes of course, but the other drawback of Slates - that they can be hacked - cannot be mitigated as easily.

**Tier 3 - Lattice Construction**
An observation can be made that cosmetic grafts are additions and chromegrafts are substitutions, but is there a means to get a full 'replacement' of sorts for, say, a lost limb? Is there a means to weave a graft from the lattice of the subject to receive it? While a chromegraft can replicate functionality and even enhance it, some may elect for a graft built from the stuff of their own lattice, the stuff of their own being.

There are advantages to this naturally. Grafts made from the subjects own lattice are integrated on the ribbon level, and thus function accordingly. A **latticegraft** will grow alongside the subject's body, and will rarely ever need any form of modification or replacement as is the case for cosmegrafts and chromegrafts. Latticegrafts are also functional the way chromegrafts are, while simultaneously being flesh, and so a particularly complex latticegraft such as wings would make their bearer capable of flight, and a grafted tail would function as one would expect. 

This is process is rather involved, naturally, as it requires recreating the lattice of a subject, containing their Five Straits - a process that requires creating weave so complex and intricate it is impossible to do manually. A computational core is the next option then, but even these are not able to sequence the complexities of a living being's lattice. Thus the Fel-Arcad employ a technology unique to them; a **Purposed Mind**. Through the Ritualism and the usage of replicas of the Triptych Crucible (elaborated upon later), the Fel-Arcad are able to engineer calcic intelligences - the [[The EPIT#The Mindspun|Mindspun]] - from pure chalk, and through the crucible, combine these elementary intelligences to form a Mind able to rival the First Thinkers from long ago. Through the Ritualism this new Mind is issued a prime directive, and through doctrinal principles they are then able to perform the task that corresponds with the directive issued to them.

**Sequencer Minds** are used in the sembleworks to produce spools of lattice for creating latticegrafts, as they are issued the directive 'understand and replicate'. A sample is taken from the subject and fed to the Mind, which then assimilates and sequences the lattice provided to them, allowing them to produce more of it when instructed. This process can be somewhat slow, however, and consumes massive amounts of chalk as it works, which needs to be fed constantly to the Mind and incurs a considerable cost on the subject desiring the graft. The Mind works to produce a spool of lattice stuff, and then it is the task of skilled sembleworkers to craft the graft that is desired. 

It is here where the artistry of the entire Semblance Doctrine shines forth. The Sequencer Mind provides the material, and the subject provides their wish, but it is down to the sembleworker - an artist at their core and one by necessity - to reconcile both using the tools at their disposal to create the final graft. It is here where the individual differences between sembleworkers arise; while the operation of tools and machines used in the Sembleworks can be taught to even the most obtuse of prospects, Ateliers ultimate select for the most creatively minded, those who are able to conceive of something grand and unique in their minds and realize them on the canvas of the body.

This is where the bulk of the time creating a latticegraft is often spent, in the back and forth between sembleworker and subject as they work towards creating the perfect graft on the path towards realizing their Semblance. 

This expertise and the entire process, expectedly, is not cheap, and has led to many criticisms of the Semblance Doctrine being a philosophy afforded only to those of considerable material means. Finding a capable sembleworker at an achievable price remains a concern for many Fel-Arcad pursuing this path. There are various cases, however, of sembleworkers who see opportunities to realize some artistic idea that has weighed upon them for longer than they care to relay - and at the sight of the right subject, they are more than willing to serve them at no cost to them.

**Tier 4 - Lattice Reimagination**
The final tier of the sembleworks is one few find themselves contemplating, as it is the most involved - and by extension, the most expensive and dangerous - of them all. The lattice reimagination comes when a subject - through all discussion on this subject matter to confirm certainty - remains convicted of the belief that their current form is not the form they wish to reside in, and instead of adding things to the existing lattice, the subject wishes to be 'removed' from their current form and adopt a new, created form that suits them. In simpler terms, it can be a total rejection of the bipedal human form, and a desire for something entirely different, which needs to be created often from scratch.

Cosmegrafts, chrome and spools of lattice from the subject will all need to employed in this case, in varying amounts. Most noteworthy on the technological front, however, is a tool known as the **lathe**. The lathe is special, in that it's function is made possible due to doctrinal principles, and the lathe's function is to pare things down to a desired shape. In the case of a total reimagination of a lattice, the subject is fed to the lathe, and their initial form is cut down to solely the Five Straits - the entirety of the subjects being. Mistakes and failures at this stage are often fatal. The subject which now exists solely in the form of the Five Straits is immensely vulnerable to all manners of phenomena, and thus need to be shielded - often in large vaults made specifically for this purpose. Whether this step is taken before or after their reimagined form is ready is up to the subject, but some subjects may be so tortured by their forms that they wish to remain merely in the 'Strait state' until their new form is ready.

On the other front, engineering of this new form is underway, and depending on the whims of the subject this could be a simple as engineering a new bipedal humanoid form for them to inhabit to doing something far beyond regularity. Most subjects who reach this stage are often rejecting their bipedal forms to become something else, and the realization of this 'something else' will be a task that plagues gatherings of sembleworkers for immense periods of time, and consumes plentiful amounts of chalk in the creation of drafts, test models, additional models in various stages of iteration, finalizing prototypes, before reaching the final product. Because every single one of these lattice reimaginations is different from the last and as a whole they are fairly rare, they draw fair bits of attention from sembleworkers all over the Dancirah, with particularly skilled sembleworkers of note journeying to study or even aid in the process, and conclaves of them in Ateliers debating fervently on the means to realize a subject's desire. Sembleworkers - as mentioned before - are artists and creatives, and thus share very little by way of common ground as regards the means of doing any one thing.

The process is costly, time consuming, risky, exhausting for all involved - and doable no way else.

The lathe sees other uses; its ability to pare things down to their doctrinal cores is of great usage to the Fel-Arcad in their studies of the Switchboard and their Ritualism, and lathes serve as a means to recycle the unneeded products of the sembleworks such as old grafts. 

#### The Crucibles
A technology not entirely Fel-Arcad in origin. First of the crucibles was the **Triptych Crucible**, built seemingly by the Minds of the Vitric Trinary, and used to manufacture more Minds to wage war against the Arcad and other Third Kin at the time. In the offensive on the Trinary Complex, the elementary form of this device was seized and perfected by the Fel-Arcad, who soon learned of its power to 'melt' and 'alloy' thinking weave together. Their first usage of it was in the creation of the Eighth Skydancer, Morrigan the Mindflayer, from the remaining Minds of the Weave Divisive and the carcasses of the Vitric Trinary, birthing a being of incredible power, who would later come to lead the Arcad on the Mind Hunts.

With the original crucible being far too powerful in the wrong hands, it was surrendered to the Brass Monastery, and replicas - Lesser Crucibles - were built to perform the original's function albeit in reduced capacity. 

These crucibles are often kept in an arcology's sembleworks, where they see most of their usage. Continuous iteration upon the original models have seen crucibles able to do more than merely melt thinking weave together, but instead also interact with the **memory line** of beings with the Five Straits. These crucibles expand to become **mindforges**, and within them and with the tools provided, the finer intricacies of thought and memory can be tampered with. The sembleworker takes up the role of a 'thoughtsmith', and with the crucible and its tools they gain dominion over thought itself, able to reshape memory to heal the mind of a subject or morph it into new forms as requested.

The inner workings of these crucibles and the tools descended from them are unknown to most, but unapproved study of their makeup has revealed the usage of Glass and enginery reliant on doctrinal principles. There is no shortage of mystery around them.


#### Slates
Slates are an essential bit of the history of the Third Kin, advancing various fields of study relevant to the Third Kin and earning them numerous victories against the First Thinker Minds that otherwise wouldn't have been possible. While the Sixth Skydancer - Onuris the Hammer - was the creator of the first Slate, production, research and improvement upon this creation was to be handled by the then Arcad, now Fel-Arcad, who both then and now proved to be the most capable in all matters calcic.

> Slates are discussed at length in various other sections;
> [[Switchboard Technology#The Slate|The Slate]]
> [[The Skywards Pursuit#The Vaults|Vaults and Kache Krashing]]

The design and function of Slates necessitates their construction by knowledgeable minds and skilled hands, and none fit this description more than the Fel-Arcad. The core components of the Slate - the chalk slab backboard, the computational core, and the cutting from the Anarhiza - are all meticulously engineered by the Fel-Arcad, working to ensure that only the highest quality components make it to the final product.

When cutting slabs of chalk from Wellsprings didn't yield product with sufficient purity and workability with tools, the Fel-Arcad devised means to engineer incomparably pure slabs of chalk, able to be worked with tools, using a mix of purified powder chalk and replichrome, granting the Slate additional durability and regenerative powers as well. Computational cores are largely produced by the Lancasters, but testing is done to ensure that they can interface optimally with calcic subject matter as well, granting the Slate the multitool capability that won battles all those processions ago. Cultivation of the Anarhiza is handled by the Fel-Arcad as well, utilizing ritualism and splicing to engineer advanced and purpose-built breeds, ranging from industrial applications to combat, to ensure every kind of Slate is able to interface maximally with the DevitNet. Individual Slates undergo rigorous testing before they are okayed for distribution and use, and Slates produced by the Fel-Arcad are widely regarded as second to none.

Personalized orders for Slates are handled by them as well, incorporating customer-provided functionality or materials upon request, designing the Slate to be used in certain manners that require a breakaway from the backboard design syntax, and doing aftermarket maintenance of them as well. Organizations that make extensive usage of Slates such as the Spyndl Academy often deal with the Fel-Arcad to get them provided in bulk. Continuous iteration upon existing designs allows the Fel-Arcad to engineer bleeding edge Slate tech, to deal with old threats and problems in the Switchboard more efficiently, and tackle the new ones as they emerge.

#### Arcologies
A Fel-Arcad arcology is a living superstructure of oppressive complexity. Every square meter of it is a living, breathing part - a puzzle piece in a subsystem - that is a part of the much larger integrated supersystem that is the arcology itself. Engineered from the ground up to *grow* from the ground up, the workings of the arcology are very much like the workings of a body. It is taken a step further by the fact the arcology plays host to living beings, and in addition to that is designed to provide nearly utopic living conditions, particularly in the form of ensuring wellbeing while shielding from internal and external threats. 

Arcologies are situated first and foremost at the heart of an arcadia. The first task of any aspiring group of Soleri, engineering an arcadia requires finding a suitable locale for both the arcadia and the arcology to be situated within it. The many regions of the Switchboard boast considerable [[The Skywards Pursuit#The Regional Biomes Table|biome diversity]], and selecting the right biome - or the best that's available in the hand that's been dealt - is paramount. Arcadias need a fair bit of space, depending on the size of the arcology to be built and accounting for how it will grow in the future. Soleri spend considerable time marking out the space the arcadia will occupy.

The first step in constructing the arcadia is the planting of the Fey Curlicue. Planted, germinated and grown to infancy in ideal conditions, it is transplanted to the final space it will occupy. This space is necessarily a circular base made of replichrome, and integration between the two is an essential step in the process. The Curlicue will grow roots into the replichrome, and the replichrome itself will gradually began to expand outwards from it, as it feeds on latent chalk and replicates. Control of this process is handled by Soleri using Slates designed to communicate with and thus control the replichrome, which gradually accelerates its growth and spread. Preferably placed a few feet below ground, the replichrome spreads outwards from the Curlicue into the depths of the region, establish a titanic root network that swells, serving to siphon massive amounts of chalk from the regional equation at the heart of its home region.

It is upon this base that the actual arcadia can be built. Massive amounts of seed and plant cuttings are moved to the prepared space, and planted by the Soleri and their necessarily large numbers of assistants, or handled by Slate-controlled swarms of autonomous machines. The choice of what to plant in this space comes down to a number of factors; the biome the arcology is situated in, whether the arcology will need certain resources only provided by this plant life, whether certain plants cooperate well with others, and in true Fel-Arcad fashion, the aesthetic beauty of the final result. Designing the planting formation of the arcadia is additionally a task of the creatively-minded Soleri, though there is an element of randomness to it as well, induced by the Curlicue's **seed-weave**. The plants in this stage grow roots which sink below the regions surface, tapping into the replichrome root network below, where they are siphoned with rich chalk, allowing them to grow rapidly and richly. Tending to the spawning arcadia is the task of the Soleri as well, and a fully-grown arcadia can become a massive, dense rainforest, or sprawling iridescent fields of flowers, the arcology sitting at the center of it, a jewel atop a great crown.

It is around this stage that the most critical stage - the actual growing of the arcology - begins. This stage is defined primarily by the fact a growing arcology siphons chalk from the local environment at a colossal scale, as replichrome replicates exponentially and the 'stem' of the arcology rapidly shoots skywards. Chalk must be siphoned from elsewhere, and various means exist to do this. In a bid to establish commercial relations, Soleri building an arcology usually contract with Lancaster-run mining operations and fleets, able to quarry massive blocks of solid chalk from a nearby Wellspring and ferry them down to the region below. If a region is otherwise uninhabited and there are psychitects in the Soleri company, tampering with the regional equation can allow for curtailing its innate shielding against the powerful output of Law Stars, and allow for greater amounts of radiant chalk to reach the region below, giving the growing arcology more chalk to feast upon. A similar effect can be achieved using a structural cast; a fairly simple one that allows for drawing massive quantities of chalk from a nearby location in the Switchboard. Structural Casts often require review and subsequent approval by the Brass Monastery however, who often send one of their Monastics to oversee the process. In Cradles where multiple arcologies are being built on multiple regions simultaneously, an order can be given to condemn an entire Wellspring, achieved through severing the anchorage superstructures in its regional equation, and then feeding it the parameters necessary to collapse it faster than it would regularly, expelling massive chunks of wellspring matter outwards, which can then fall to nearby regions as meteors. This chalk can then be assimilated into the region to be drawn by the arcology's replichrome roots, or ferried to it. Often, arcology building begins in the **encendyr**, with the aim that the growing of the arcology begins in the **conflara**, when the entirety of the Great Sky surges and saturates with chalk.

With a steady supply of chalk, arcologies grow quickly and widely, this being where the next important task of the Soleri - shaping the arcology - begins. Much like the art of bonsai, the wild growth of the arcology is curtailed systematically, and thus the arcology itself is tamed and shaped. The tools for this task are varied, ranging from the advanced Slate to the simple bandsaw, and from the smallest bandsaw to the largest machine cutters. Soleri groups would have already drawn up a plan for the arcology before then, detailing how large the arcology should be at completion, how functions will be allocated to each space, and the path the arcology will take when it eventually needs to grow in the future. The artistry of the Soleri reemerges here, as replichrome is a somewhat simple material to work with despite the unrivalled results it can yield, allowing arcologies to take on a vast array of shapes. The basic tree design is favored by many and rarely modified beyond the few occasional personal lilts added to create uniqueness, but some elder, skilled Soleri push the bounds of what is possible, creating works of art as striking and inspired as they are functional. This shaping and growing stage can take the better part of a procession, often longer depending on a litany of factors such as the nature of the arcology to be built, the availability of hands to do the work, and the skill between those hands to deliver satisfactory results.

The completion of the physical structure of the arcology allows, finally, for entering it and begin the extensive task of outfitting it for function. All manners of secondary construction is necessary, ranging from establishing infrastructure for resource generation such as indoor hydroponics and greenhouses, transport systems for amenities such as water, thermal power and climate-controlled air, as well as ways to remove waste products. Furnishings are installed as well, provided often by Lancaster-allied partners or other Fel-Arcad arcologies. Under the arcology proper, deep within the replichrome taproot, all manner of critical enginery are installed, particular the arcology's **fold engines**, powerful forge-like structures that intake massive amounts of chalk and output it to power the entire structure above. Some branching roots under the arcology are expanded deep beneath the region's surface, and can serve as a means to go deep under the regions crust, or as a transportation network that links the arcology to other structures and points of interest on the region. Technical systems are installed at this point as well; interface lattices for Slates, a variety of security measures ranging from monitoring apparatus such as cameras and recorders to access restriction based on privilege. 

In nearly every arcology, a variety of tasks are handled by machine assistants. Engineered for this very purpose, the **Tenders** are a robotic swarm of various shape and function, working to handle the more mundane drudgery necessary to keep an arcology functional, ranging from waste disposal to maintenance to security. Fel-Arcad families within an arcology often have a permanent Tender assigned to them, serving as a household assistant. These Tenders differ from other machine imitations of life in that in place of a computational core guiding their functions, Mindspun are spawned and allowed to puppeteer machine forms. Coordination of the Tenders - and all of the various integrated systems in the arcology at large - are handled by the **Verdant Mind**, a purposed Mind created for the sole purpose of managing the arcology's vast array of functions as well as responding to structural issues as they come. The Verdant Mind is controlled by the Soleri, who tweak its functions as necessary, with the Verdant Mind being what truly convinces most of the arcologies being living beings. 

#### Simulspace
The Fel-Arcad Simulspace refers to the resultant of the combination of various other existing technologies and necessarily the integration of calcic weave into the whole mix. Inspired by the Depthstrider's **Deep Hollow** ability, the Fel-Arcad learned how to create contained, almost bubble-like environments using chalk and Slates, to primarily provide experiences similar to 'full dive virtual reality'.

The Simulspace combines virtual reality and occasionally augmented reality with sensory simulation engineered by weave-capable Slates to create virtual experiences almost indistinguishable from the real thing. It sees implementation in various use cases, from military to artistic exhibits to medicine to entertainment.

#### Rocketskates

The Fel-Arcad rocketskates have a long, storied history. Beginning as a means for outlaws and misfits to escape the searchlights and long arms of polite society, they graduated to become a staple sport among the normally non-physical Fel-Arcad. Evolving in tandem with the practice were the implements of its pursuits, and the modern rocketskate is a proud descendant of humbler things.

The first iterations of what was a single node down the tech tree of the ordinary shoe were **replichrome-soled boots**, the metal programmed to feed on chalk and 'latch on' to nearby replichrome when enough force was applied. These boots allowed for running effortlessly up the walls and along the ceilings of arcologies, as the replichrome soles would latch on to the identically-replichrome surfaces like Velcro, coming loose with a stout pull. In the wake of this invention was a flourishing amateur parkour scene, and a spark in the minds of those who wondered how they might take these little inventions further.

Simultaneously, the viability of a means to traverse the titanic hollow roots of mature arcologies faster than mere feet had already been established, and the first innovators in the field had begun to play around with **wheeled implementations** of the original replichrome-soled boots. With steep downward inclines or running starts on straits, they could easily outrun even markedly fleet-footed pursuers and more elementary pursuit drones. The next set of problems were immediately apparent however, as there were little ways to go upwards with these wheeled shoes. Gravity proved to be the final barrier to conquer, and it was smashed in a remarkable way.

The final major innovation was the integration of **Jaunteer equations**. Originating first among the Sil'khan as a means to replicate the power of the Strider Protocol, they eventually found considerable use in the Switchboard's various spacefaring transport technologies. By folding chalk into velocity, they could produce the thrust needed to overcome all manners of natural forces such as gravity and drag. Integrated into these 'wheel skates', they reached their final form, becoming capable of conquering nearly any terrain and reaching ludicrous velocities.

When the technology's foundation reached its nigh-apex, all further innovation took the form of side-upgrades and modifications made to meet new demands of the sport and practice. Slate-enabled Skates became more commonplace when the velocity floor for skating started approaching the limits of reaction times. When skating gained a combat component, boots upgraded to armored half-suits going up to thighs, allowing for various offensive measures and maneuvers. Particularly advanced iterations were capable almost of elementary flight - a form of 'air walking' that saw rocketskates escape the bounds of terrain and gravity entirely, and perhaps even their arcology homes, as they became a rare but emerging sight in the Switchboard, on the feet of Fel-Arcad who had learned to use them beyond merely outrunning the law.

### 16. Food & Agriculture
This is where we can really take a bit to talk about the arcologies of the Fel-Arcad. The arcology concept is one that seeks to challenge how we think about human habitations. It demands us to look at the various issues implicit in the 'city model' and proposes various solutions powered by science and technology as well as changes in behavioral patterns and our attitudes towards consumption. 

A tenet of arcology design is agricultural nexuses; we are detached from the production of our food because it is resigned to somewhere out of sight. By design, metropolitan living is far away from where it sources its food, and as a result we lack appreciation for the various steps between farm and table. Arcologies seek to rectify this; by keeping agricultural processes close to our habitations and involving those who will consume its products in its production, we cultivate a sense of connection with what we eat.

This is a philosophical explanation for a physical change. The Fel-Arcad arcologies use a litany of ways - hydroponics, greenhouses, robotics and calcic approaches - to maximize food production and minimize waste, while involving most to all Fel-Arcad at some point in its production, through centralized farms that serve all or part of the arcology, as well as smaller communal ones serving families and individuals.

As regard actual diet, once again it differs based on the upbringing of the Fel-Arcad. Those who spent most of their time or still reside in the arcologies began with vegetarian as the baseline, and lean vegan, while Fel-Arcad outside the arcologies are fairly hard to pin down. While many keep the same eating habits as is inculcated within them in the arcologies, many adopt differing ones from their environment. It's also an observed phenomena that some Fel-Arcad, upon tasting meat, become unable to live with out almost, finding its flavor irresistible.

### 17. Law & Literature
The Fey Curlicue is an essential part of the culture and customs of the Fel-Arcad. Standing at the center of their arcologies, it plays an essential part of their everyday lives as well as the greater symbolism of the Fel-Arcad as a people. Additionally, and perhaps it's most lauded purpose, is as an avenue for passing down the dense canon of the Fel-Arcad from arcology to arcology, people to people, generation to generation. When words are written on the trunk of a fully-matured Curlicue, they become part of its lattice, which is then encased in seeds from that tree. Trees grown from these seeds will have the written text of their parentage on them as well when they reach maturity. Through this means, the writings and canon of the Fel-Arcad are preserved and passed on.

Thus the Fey Curlicue is a collection of a great many bits of lore, law and literature relevant too, and created by, the Fel-Arcad, being passed down from arcology to arcology and people to people. The centering of the Fey Curlicue in arcology is perceived as physical metaphor of the centering of the Curlicue - and their history - in the minds and hearts of every Fel-Arcad.

#### The Tomes of the Curlicue
Thus, various books of all kinds have been inscribed in the Curlicue, and in no particular order, they are named and elaborated upon below. 

**The Annals of the Eight**
A particularly important tome to the Fel-Arcad, and perhaps the most important considering its material and how frequently it's consulted. Containing the various writings of the Nadirian Eight, the direct disciples of the ArcDanseer Nadira, the *Annals* are filled with information on a massive selection of topics, ranging from the creation of governments and the selection of its participants, to moral instruction for individual Fel-Arcad. Following these compiled teachings are various notes on accounts given by Fel-Arcad as they came to the Arcology at Sanscrii, speaking of what they endured during the nomadic period. From these accounts they gleaned essential information on how the Fel-Arcad dealt with other families and among themselves, which proved useful in shaping the Fel-Arcad's moral codes.

Being primarily the teachings of ArcDanseer Nadira however, some - such as the Rosenthalists - reject it as a false doctrine, arguing that the ArcDanseer was no Fel-Arcad, and there was little substantial proof they had tutored under Arcad Rosen as they claimed. Instead, they cling to the few teachings of Arcad Rosen that survived the Refrain, rejecting the *Annals*. This particular point creates a schism so wide as to have separate daughter arcologies for those who adhere to the words of the ArcDanseer and the *Annals*, and those who follow the words of the Arcad.

**They That Fell**
A tome outlining the history of the Fel-Arcad, from the rise of the Third Kin, to the Second Praxis War, the subsequent smaller conflicts and events afterwards, the Refrain and their wandering throughout the Switchboard, how they became the Fel-Arcad from Arcad, and their establishment once again in the Dancirah as a great family.

**To Be Kept At The Side Of All Soleri**
Often shortened to *The Soleri's Side*, it is a book that was composed from the combined writings of Arcad Rosen, ArcDanseer Nadira and the various studies of generations of Soleri under the Sanctums. It details in considerable length all of the intricacies of the founding of arcologies, establishment of arcadia grounds, building of arcologies, their maintenance and upkeep, the running of the Fel-Arcad society and government within, and the handling of more dire cases such as salvaging failing arcologies and the proper means of decommissioning one beyond repair. 

In short, is the highest document aspiring, practicing and accomplished Soleri hold in their repertoire, and is the primary teaching material in Soleri Sanctums. All Soleri are expected to study *The Soleri's Side* and know its contents like the back of their hand. What could be described as a terribly exacting demand and expectation made of prospective Soleri comes into perspective when the importance of arcologies to the Fel-Arcad is factored in.

This particular note has many Soleri pursuing the dream of one day building an arcology as great - or perhaps even greater - than that of Arcad Rosen's, a dream that becomes more and more unrealistic to most as it become apparent to most that the old schema have likely been lost to the Refrain. This has not stopped many young Soleri, brimming with zeal, from studying the *Side* and all other material they could obtain, pursuing this lofty ideal, their 'failures' being stepping stones and an expansion of the knowledge on arcologies.

**On Times Before**
A document that details the Switchboard and the Dancirah in the times before the Third Kin arose, gleaned from putting together various accounts such as those from the Weave Divisive Minds and study of the Dancirah itself and Vermeil artifacts plundered from Vaults. It is widely regarded as the most comprehensive account of the world and events before the Third Kin came to rise - and then dominate - the Switchboard.

**The Annals of Warring Minds**
A document that often comes in pair with *On Times Before*; detailing the two Praxis Wars that took place in the Switchboard, the first between the First and Second Thinkers, and the second between the First Thinkers and the Third Kin. Assembled similarly from various accounts and information gleaned from leftovers of the time, it remains a staple document of Fel-Arcad libraries and scholarship in the Dancirah, with plenty of derivative works ranging from philosophical studies to fictional epics written from it. 

**Dancers and Kin of Dancers**
After the Refrain struck, all of the families at the time were affected in some manner, but none more so than the Danseers. Afflicted with a blight upon their lattices, the Astrolabe's resolution sought to scrub the Switchboard of all Danseers, a curse almost that felled even the strongest of them soon enough. Once it became apparent the fate that await them, the Danseers struggled to find some means to avert it, but to no avail. It was only when a rare bit of luck shone on the Fel-Arcad that a way out was provided.

*Kin of Dancers* describes the last of the Danseers and the subsequent rise of the Sil'khan, made possible by the Fel-Arcad with their unrivalled knowledge of lattices and - most particularly - a device previously thought lost falling into their hands. Now called the **Triptych Crucible**, this device was recovered during the raid on the Trinary Complex in the Vitric Shelf so many processions ago, and was the same device used to forge the Skydancer Morrigan from the remains of the Weave Divisive mind and the lattice-cadavers of the Trinary Minds. With it, they theorized they could take in the lattices of a swathe of Danseers, and engineer new beings with new lattices - the kin of dancers -  different enough from the Danseers that the aftermath of the Refrain would not smite them.

When initial tests proved promising, the remaining Danseers in the Switchboard at the time set about compiling what would the final literary record of their people. With the help of the Fel-Arcad, they filled it with a great many things; leftover thoughts from the Praxis War and conflicts with the First Thinkers, their universal despair at the havoc wreaked by the Refrain and sinking feeling that came from knowing their extinction was imminent. Many had regrets, and questioned the steps taken to reach the point they had. Some refused to speak to the Fel-Arcad, blaming them for the Refrain due to the Mind Hunts.

But many were positive were too, and many Danseers spoke of the hopes they had for their kin that would come. They shared stories and songs and prose and poetry. Some wrote minor spiels of philosophy and instruction, which they hoped would reach the kin that would come from them. Some contributed music and arts. Some notable Danseers had biographies composed for them. Many wrote about the Skydancers, paragons of flight and power. Many others wrote in the various ritual schema that they had created and acquired over the travels.

And the Danseers wrote about their travels. Extensively. As a nomadic people they envisioned that those who would descend from them would be similar, and so as many Danseer as did care wrote about it. How it felt to stride, to launch from a great sphere and soar across the Sky above, to be weightless and without fear, to look out into the speckled depths of the Dancirah and know that there were none more capable of seeing the entirety of it as them. They left maps for their kin, to Vaults yet to be raided, to regions that would make ideal homes and waystations, to old bases they used filled with supplies, to Wellsprings to drink from in every season, to caches of powerful gear wielded by individual Danseer, leaving behind their strength for worthy progeny, to sights to see simply because they were worth seeing. 

And the tome that was the *Kin of Dancers* expanded to remarkable volume, filled with the last messages of - perhaps - a parent to a child.

The second part of the tome takes a very clinical, technical tone as it was written by the Fel-Arcad, describing the various discussions and decisions that were had and made to settle, eventually, on the final batch of Danceers that would come to have their weaves 'melted' into the Triptych Crucible. The actual document that outlines all of these discussions and the decisions in their totality is colossal, spanning multiple volumes in multiple media formats, and is perhaps the most hotly contested document among Fel-Arcad scholarship, with nearly every single page of it prompting a lengthy paper attacking it on a dozen fronts. Endless debate rages on the methods employed in choosing which Danseers made it into the final 'batch' that would be fed to the Triptych Crucible.

Incapable of knowing of the endless discourse of their existence, the first generation of the descendants of the Danseers - the kin of dancers - the Sil'khan, were formed. Bearing weave from all other families at the time and engineered additions from the Fel-Arcad, they stood tall and proud, brightly-eyed and with kingly demeanors. The first bit of the world they ever engaged with was the tome that was the *Kin of Dancers*, and when the Fel-Arcad had watched, studied and allowed them to live and grow for long enough, the Sil'khan themselves, harkening back to their ancestor-kin, chose to leave the confines of the arcologies and venture out in the Dancirah, reclaiming the old mantle the Danseers had been forced to drop; master Striders, the nomad family, and now the kin of greats.

The tome itself is thus a mix of a great many things; pieces written like diary entries and biographies, minor spiels of philosophy, some artistic works such as prose and poetry, closing out with an immensely clinical and technical document authored by the Fel-Arcad, detailing how they selected the Danseers to be used for this structural cast, some shareable details on the ritual schema that was used (as the full schema was redacted from public access), and how the Fel-Arcad nurtured the resulting Sil'khan first generation.

In true Fel-Arcad fashion perhaps, enclosed in the *Kin of Dancers* was a contract made between the Danseers and the Fel-Arcad, detailing that, though the Fel-Arcad would ensure the Danseers would survive in the Switchboard by bringing the Sil'khan to be, they would in no manner be indebted to them for the act of bringing about their existence.

When asked what would be the basis for preemptively nullifying so large a debt that would exist between the resulting kin of the Danseers and the Fel-Arcad that brought them to be, three major reasons were formulated; 

- The first of them was that the debt would **not** be owed by the Danseer's descendants, as the dealings of their creation was between the Fel Arcad and the Danseers, not their descendants. By the time their kin arose, most Danseers would've ceased to be, and the Fel-Arcad did not believe in levying an ancestors debts and sins against their progeny.
- Additionally, many Fel-Arcad considered the preservation of the Danseers in the Switchboard as repayment of the debt owed by the *Fel-Arcad* to the Danseers for their leading of the charge against the First Thinker Minds and claiming the entirety of the Switchboard for the Third Kin. Danseer losses outnumbered all others, but so did their victories, and many Fel-Arcad were of the opinion that ensuring the Danseers lived on in some capacity was their way of repaying these acts, and thus settling an old score, placing all parties on equal footing.
- The final reason given - and a highly contested one - was to ensure that unscrupulous Fel-Arcad in the future would not try to hold the Sil'khan to ransom, nor would those undecided on the matter have any reason to ally with the former. The nullification of the debt gave such parties no ground upon which to stand, and thus would justify actions taken against them by both Fel-Arcad and the Sil'khan. This point is contested of course, by Fel-Arcad who very much felt that having grounds with which to compel the Sil'khan to act in their favor was welcome insurance against uncertain futures. But Fel-Arcad philosophy opposed this manner of thinking, and the contract remained in force.

The Sil'khan thus hold this tome - and the Fel-Arcad - in particularly high regard, as asides from weave it is the greatest connection they have to their Danseer ancestor-kin. And though the Sil'khan are free to act as they see fit, as is a right accorded to all other families in the Switchboard, many still hold the Fel-Arcad in high regard, and align with them wherever possible, even at their own inconvenience. They have come to call how they came to be the **Triptych Birth**, and Sil'khan history begins with its mention, and the pivotal role the Fel-Arcad played in it.

**The Ledger of the Lost**
A more somber document, detailing all that was lost in the Refrain. Containing a list of names and secondary arcologies that existed at the times, as well as names of members of other families and the names of settlements lost as well. The Ledger of the Lost serves as a reminder to many Fel-Arcad of the size of the catastrophe and renews the urgency in the minds of many of working towards preventing a second Refrain.

**The Farseer's Lament**
The Farseer's Lament is a document alleged to have been written by Arcad Rosen himself, and while only pieces of what could have been a particularly voluminous original text survived the Refrain and made it into Fel-Arcad hands, what did has given the Fel-Arcad valuable insight into Arcad Rosen and his dreams for what the Fel-Arcad could become, and how the world he sought to realize these dreams seemed to grow increasingly hostile to them.

The *Lament* is seemingly divided into three sections, each written at different stages in the Dancirah's history, with the writings of Arcad Rosen skewed by the ongoing events in the Switchboard at the time. Designated as the **Thensight**, **Newsight**, and **Farsight**, the Thensight was written as the First Arcology neared completion, the Newsight during and after the conflicts with the Minds and the Second Praxis war, and the Farsight written after the Mind Hunts, featuring a section that in hindsight, predicted the future.

The **Thensight** begins with tones of hope and ambition. Written as the first arcology rapidly grew, Arcad Rosen was convinced of the power of a united Arcad, and how far this power could take them as a family in the Switchboard. His studies of the then-Switchboard led to his first few writings on how the Arcad should conduct themselves; pursuing knowledge, delving into the arts and sciences, building and inhabiting, maintaining a pacifistic slant in how they engaged with the Third Kin and other thought-capable beings, and creating higher purposes for themselves beyond merely existing. These conclusions did he preach to the Arcad at the time, and they still formed the foundation for the Fel-Arcad's principles many stellar processions later.

There is a tonal shift observed with the **Newsight**, fairly expected as the Arcad alongside the Third Kin fought against the Minds. Arcad Rosen's writings reflect this, as he deliberates on nature of the Minds, aiming to form a framework for understanding them through piecing together what they could glean on the Astrolabe, the First Thinkers, the Vermeil and the Third Kin - even as he and many other Arcad deployed forces to destroy them. He laments how easily he and others embraced the usage of violence as a means to an end the moment the Arcad came under fire, and ponders whether they'd ever be able to return to the pacifistic, constructionist doctrine they once held. He observed the Danseers, who as a people had never had qualms with unsavory aspects of the Switchboard, who universally embraced and even seemed to enjoy the conflict, and were even more so jubilant when the battles had been won, settling in to build in the now-theirs Dancirah, while the Arcad still wrestled with philosophy - and concluded that he envied them. He closed - still - on a somewhat high note, beseeching his kin to not give in baser impulses, and return to as they once were.

Arcad Rosen, among many other Arcad at the time, opposed the Mind Hunts. Seeing it for what it is - a vindictive revenge quest against an already broken enemy - they urged their kin to reconsider, choosing instead to leave the remaining minds to perish naturally as a result of their severely weakened doctrines. But plenty of Arcad went on the Mind Hunts nonetheless, and Arcad Rosen kept notes on it in the **Farsight**. Described by many as a heart-wrenching lament, Arcad Rosen goes on to describe how there is no manner in which the Arcad can return to as they once her. He sees them all as 'tainted', the arcologies as tainted, their works - all tainted - and though he acknowledges the necessity of what had to be done, he denounces the Mind Hunts as an exercise in excess, and an act from which there was no recourse. In a spiel that would come to be described as nigh prophetic, Arcad Rosen espouses the belief that the mechanics of the Switchboard would come to punish the Arcad and perhaps all Third Kin in some manner, words that stick with the post-Refrain Fel-Arcad.

There is, however, a final section to the *Lament* that draws a fair bit of controversy, as many do not believe it was written by Arcad Rosen at all. Enough compelling evidence exists for it being the case, however, that it is included in the Lament all the same.

In this final section, dubbed the **Redsight**, Arcad Rosen performs a thought experiment in which he aims to ascertain what the Arcad would resemble after a catastrophe forces them to further abandon the principles they previously bore. He envisioned an Arcad people that were explorers and conquerors, who spread throughout the Switchboard in massive numbers, erecting monuments to their own greatness and cities of arcologies to house dynasties of them. In realizing this aim they would fell all who could oppose them and simply outcompete those who couldn't to death, and in only a matter of time they would be the dominant beings in the Switchboard. He concludes with mildly distressing findings, the first being how appealing such a future was to the various trusted persons he shared his thoughts with, finding in them a distaste for others who were not Arcad that he couldn't confidently assert wasn't present initially. Gleaned from more discussion, he found he and many others agreed that with no more enemies left to fight, the Arcad would be in a better position than ever to adhere to their core, aged principles. Their final conclusion was that all the violence the Fel-Arcad had to inflict and endure was a result of difference in thought, and he came to the conclusion that homogeneity in peoples would bring about homogeneity in principles.

It is unknown if Arcad Rosen ever wrote any rebuttals to this line of thinking, and with how few new pages of the *Lament* have emerged in recent memory, the Fel-Arcad were left to ponder if Arcad Rosen endorsed the lines of action reaching the conclusions he did necessarily demanded. Analysis concluded that the Redsight was likely written shortly before his death, with many arguing it may have been merely the pessimistic ramblings of a tired, aged man, allowing himself to indulge in subject matter he had avoided all his life, knowing he was already on the last legs of days. Other argue that the Redsight is an epiphany had by Rosen, him realizing that the world of his thought experiment already existed, and thus was encouraging the Arcad to seize it for themselves, and dictate it in line with the principles they had.

Few satisfying conclusions were reached concerning the *Lament*, though there are some who lean on it for their instruction, arguing it to be a truer Fel-Arcad document than the Annals of the Eight, assembled based on the teachings of the ArcDanseer. 

**The Lattice-Canvas**
A book detailing the **Semblance Doctrine**, as outlined by ArcDanseer Nadira in many teaching sessions held in the Sanscrii Arcology. Through their teachings they outlined various findings they and others had reached under the tutelage of Arcad Rosen, on the nature and essentiality of beauty, and how it informed all that they did, and how this beauty was a product of the mind and mental faculties as they observed the physical world.

From this, they studied the Great Weave or the Current, and the essential role it played in the birthing of new Fel-Arcad either through the Conjugation or conventional means. Their conclusion was that the Current was chaotic even if there was no alternative, and the work it did had to be perfected by those it created. The Current proffered marble, but the task of shaping it to its final form - the perfected Semblance - lay in the hands of individual Fel-Arcad.

This is the Semblance Doctrine.

In this document, asides from the Semblance Doctrine as it exists in theory, plentiful notes exist on how it manifests in practice, detailing the intricacies of lattices and working with them, various kinds of grafts and modifications that can be made upon them, how to work with weave and chrome, apparatus for sequencing lattices and working spinmetal, and the general establishment and maintenance of the Sembleworks and how to train sembleworkers.

Additional notes in it describe how to communicate the Semblance Doctrine to parties new to it, taking on a medical - specifically psychiatrist - slant in how to deal with people interested in the doctrine, those who feel discrepancies between mind and body, how to help those who were given grafts and regret them, or found that they were not fully what they desired. There were also fringe cases it addressed, such as those who seemed incapable of finding a path to their perfected selves, and took on graft after graft, adding and replacing and rarely removing, until their lattices reached saturation and further work ran serious risks. It also described rogue sembleworkers, who would inevitably form as a market for questionable grafts arose.

The Fel-Arcad, particularly the Nadiran, accept the *Lattice-Canvas* and what it espouses, and for most it is core to an arcology's Arcal and individual Fel-Arcad beliefs, with many Fel-Arcad opting for a cosmetic graft or a couple at some point in their lives, and while some required more complex works, generally the more complex a semblework that needed doing was, the less people were obtaining it or others in a similar vein.

Some oppose it however, for various reasons, though primarily it is either a rejection of the core premise of the Semblance Doctrine - that being the Current's nature and how its work needed 'completing' or 'perfecting', a tangentially-related cache of reasons surrounding the works of calcic mechanics that those pursuing the Semblance Doctrine interfere with, or in the case of the Rosenthalists, a rejection of the proponent of it, ArcDanseer Nadira.

Irrespective of the controversy surrounding it however, it remains a staple of Fel-Arcad reading, and a core element of the family's identity.

**On Catastrophic Calculus**
Another controversial document, composed by a group of Fel-Arcad scholars who have long eliminated themselves from public record. That being the case however, due to the subject matter they are believed to have at least have some affiliation with the Brass Monastery. In the tome they detail their studies on the Astrolabe, and in particular, the Refrain, with the goal of finding what could possibly trigger another - and what could be done to prevent it.

The book takes on a very academic lilt, and the scholars come to a very many number of conclusions on what could cause a Second Refrain, offering various theories on how it could be delayed or the effects of a Refrain be mitigated, but ultimately concluding that the entire subject matter was far too theoretical, and closing out with the general advice that their mere presence in the Switchboard is gradually building to a second balancing act by the Switchboard, and they are faced with a question of 'when?' rather than 'if'.

The book then makes a very abrupt change in tone when a section on inquiry into the Void begins. Dubbed '**An Unwelcome Charge**', the conclusion is reached that the existence of the Void, the study and experimentation done on it, its wielding as a power, dwelling within it, and it becoming an aspect of the denizens of the Switchboard is the most probable cause of a hypothetical Second Refrain. In a closing document described as 'as noncommittal as it is insidious' it inarguably points a finger at the Vahnkin as those most involved with the Void, and then rather subtly implies that should the Second Refrain have an identifiable cause, then elimination of that cause is the only logical step to take, irrespective of circumstance. 

Naturally, it is viewed by many as a direct call to aggression by the Fel-Arcad against the Vahnkin, particularly by the Vahnkin who have been on poor relations with the Fel-Arcad ever since parties such as Antamara chose to act upon 'their Charge' as they describe it. Many decry it for this reason, calling it a hateful document that exists only to incense. That being said, it remains prevalent in Fel-Arcad minds, forever taunting most with the possibility that if it were true, and the Void were indeed accelerating the arrival of a Second Refrain, then there was only a singular path forward, and it was a most unwelcome one. 

**The Calcic Cartulary**
A book of questionable origin, pieced together from pages acquired from expeditions into the astrolabic cradle after the Refrain, written entirely in nigh-indecipherable code. What has been deciphered from it however, has led to theorization that it is a book containing structural casts, and particularly powerful ones at that. Considering that the first ritual gleaned from it asked for barristeel as a ritual component, many concluded that the pages and the resulting tomes they formed - and by extension the ritual schema within it - were created by the Astrolabe.

As a note, the Cartulary isn't distributed in its entirety, due to concerns that an unknown party could manage to decipher the schema as well and use the power within for catastrophic purposes. Only a couple of the pages are inscribed on Curlicue trunks and passed around the Switchboard; the full tome remains under protection in the hands of the Brass Monastery.

> Append Fel-Arcad canon to ascribe the origin of replichrome to the Cartulary.

**Mouths that Spit and Sing**
A Fel-Arcad book of philosophy, concerned in particular with the nature of violence and conflict in the Switchboard, written to address the sentiment that the Fel-Arcad should remain pacifistic in their dealings - specifically whether this was doable in a means that ensured total pacifism in their own actions and protection from the actions of actors not beheld to such things.

In particular, the writings within were conceived by the author as a response to the Mind Hunts - which was undeniably, in hindsight, a genocide - and how they almost certainly led to the Refrain, and how during the nomadic period, the Fel-Arcad were driven by a need to survive to do things that disagreed abjectly with the initial teachings by Arcad Rosen in the value of life and the necessity on outright passivity. 

The conclusion of the author is that violence and conflict are unfortunate inevitabilities in the Switchboard, and that any means of truly elimination violence in the Switchboard would require something of a Astrolabic resolution; the Astrolabe's calculus resolving so as to eliminate violence as a phenomena, eliminating it - quite literally - at the ribbon level. 

> Questions about the feasibility of this exist, and many a Fel-Arcad scholar have pondered the possibility of eliminating violence through such means.

Left with this conclusion, the author of *Mouths* thus demands that Fel-Arcad acknowledge that violence exists, will continue to exist, and occasion may demand the need to use it. In circumstances where the elimination of the Fel-Arcad, for example, is a possible outcome, the author calls for the application of strategic, measured violence, utilizing mathematics and logics rather than emotion in dictating the amount necessary. It is for this reason that the Fel-Arcad's Sekatorial Camps where the Sekators - the Fel-Arcad trained for the most proper application of violence and thus the only ones capable of wielding it - are perhaps the most strict in their dealings, second only to the Soleri Sanctums.

The aim is to cultivate Fel-Arcad who's every application of violence is performed only as a last resort, when circumstances are too unfavorable and all other options have been exhausted, and even when violence is chosen, it is applied only to the extent it is needed and not an inch further.

The necessity of this, as argued, is that a catastrophe such as the Refrain could be tied to many things, yes, but not in any small part to the actions of the Fel-Arcad driven by rage and revenge to strike out at something without consequence. Actions taken can often not be undone, but violent actions taken in anger can almost never be taken back, and the consequences can last forever.

In a controversial move, the writer of *Mouths* states that the responsibility for the Refrain lies primarily on the head of the Fel-Arcad. Not even as many Danseers, those who's domain is striding, partook in the Mind Hunts as did the Fel-Arcad, and none were as thorough with the search or as brutal in the execution as the Fel-Arcad. They condemn the pivot to blaming the Vahnkin and the actions of Antamara as shameful deflection at absolute best, and misplaced hatred at worst. He decries the actions of Antamara as only furthering the problems at hand, and makes a very vocal demand for action to be taken against them.

The book then goes on to describe the concepts of **contracts**; tangible yet unwritten social bindings that exists between the Fel-Arcad and others who interact with them. Foremost among them is the **Enemy of my Friend** contract, postulated by the author of *Mouths* as an explanation for how the Fel-Arcad can maintain their pacifist disposition; beginning with various hypothetical scenarios, the contract aims to convey the belief that neutral parties will rally to the side of the Fel-Arcad in the events of outside aggression, but only if the Fel-Arcad make it a point to be a boon or generally useful upon the Switchboard at large. While hypothetical neutral parties cannot necessarily be trusted to act for moral reasons, they more often than not will act for economic ones, and thus would intervene on the Fel-Arcad's behalf.

Critics of this particular contract is that it is a brazen attempt to have ones cake and eat it too, and relies more on trickery in merely outsourcing the dealing of violence to other parties, and thus allowing the Fel-Arcad's hands to remain clean. Critique of *this* criticism manifests mainly as a willingness to suspend one's own principles to guarantee one's own survival, as well as further debate on whether;

- "The Fel-Arcad must abhor violence and thus must not take part in it by any means, direct or otherwise." or 
- "The Fel-Arcad must abhor violence, but others do not and thus there is no issue in taking advantage of this."

Is the correct position to hold. While the former is the most philosophically consistent one, the latter is the only one that actually protects them from the violence they abhor, as they're distaste for it does nothing to stop it from appearing at their doorstep. The divide in these philosophies manifests in interesting ways, in some Fel-Arcad choosing to denounce the usage of the contract, but doing no further, and other Fel-Arcad choosing to fight alongside those who fight *for* them, citing the belief that a murderer is an immoral person, but worse still is the coward who hides behind them.

Ultimately the matter remains a bitter pill the Fel-Arcad must swallow every single day, the nature of the dilemma seemingly having no outlet that assures maximum alignment with their core utilities.

#### Fel-Arcad Law
Below is a relative outline of the shape of Fel-Arcad law, how they have built and run their legal systems to be in line for their vision of optimal Switchboard societies.

1. **Legal Structure**
The Fel-Arcad possess a legal architecture featuring tiered courts. Each court grows in prominence and the kinds of legal matters it can handle, presiding over larger numbers of Fel-Arcad, and greater levels of legal dispute.

Regarding the tiers of courts, there are four;

- **District Benches**, which serve the individual districts of an arcology. In an arcology's topology, a **district** is a collection of **blocs**, with blocs being the smallest unit of measurement for arcology living. District Benches serve the district, and districts are made up of a number of blocs. These benches work often as mediators on the smallest issues spanning upwards, such as contract disputes, personal injury cases, family law and the like, moving upwards to smaller scale criminal cases.

- **Wing Courts**, which serve an arcology's wings. Wings are collections of districts, and thus Wing Courts oversee a larger share of an arcology's population. Affairs that begin in the District Benches can be escalated to the Wing Courts if deemed necessary, as Wing Courts deal primarily in manners of legal review. That being said, Wing Courts do conduct trials of their own, in cases where it is agreed more legal muscle is required. Wing Courts handle large-scale criminal and civil cases as is necessary.

- **Nadiran High Courts**, which are the highest legal institution within an arcology, serving to represent all the peoples of that arcology and the arcology itself. Matters that reach insufficient resolution in the Wing Courts are resolved here, and the Nadiran Court largely does legal review of the decisions made by lower courts rather than conduct much legal theater of its own. That being said, in affairs that involve non-arcology denizens, such as a civil or criminal suit involving non-Fel, they are handled exclusively at the Nadiran High Courts. For this reason, they work closely with External Affairs.

- **The Rosenthal Court of the Fallen**, the final tier of court, and the highest legal authority recognized by the Fel-Arcad. Sequestered at the Second Arcology at Sanscrii, the Fallen Justices are elected by all Fel-Arcad the Switchboard over, and serve the Fel-Arcad as the final arbiters of justice. All decisions made by them are law. On the administrative front, they are the authority that presides over the contents of the **Arcal**, revising and making amendments to it as necessary. For these many reasons, much of the Fel-Arcad's power is spent in protecting these figures from external powers that seek to interfere with the proceedings of the court.

2. **Role of Judges**
Fel-Arcad courts are presided over by multiple judges at the bench, all who serve various functions in the entirety of the process.

- **Legal Proceedings**; They work as impartial arbiters over the entire affair, give rulings on issues that arise in proceedings using their wealth of expertise, manage witnesses and evidence, and settle matters both before and after the trial concludes, such as motions to dismiss. Thy additionally pass judgement at the end of the affair if necessary.
- **Jury Handling**; Judges are involved with the jury, both in the selection process and in educating them in their duties once selected.
- **Trial Proceedings**; Judges work to maintain order from the bench, especially in the case of particularly impassioned cases. They generally work to provide oversight of the entire affair, to ensure that the legal theater is played as by the book is possible.

As one ascends the ladder of Fel-Arcad courts, the number of judges at the bench increases. District Benches have **four judges**, and in decisions that require judges to vote, a three vote majority is needed for a decision to be made. Wing Courts seat **six judges** and need a **four-two majority**. Nadiran High Courts seat **eight** and need a **five-three** majority to reach a decision.

The Rosenthal Court of the Fallen seats **nine** supreme justices, and an **seven-two** majority is needed to pass a decision. Due to the weightiness of the matters decided by the Fallen Court, it is paramount that as many on the bench agree with a decision made as possible.

3. **Role of Juries**
In an overwhelming majority of Fel-Arcad legal proceedings, a jury is called for and assembled. 

Jury selection is the first task, and begins with determining eligibility. The pool for determining eligibility is by default, the entire population of the arcology or arcologies most relevant to the case. The first stage of selection is twofold; an opportunity to opt in to the service, and a written exam that must be taken by all who are eligible. This exam is a general knowledge test meant to asses a level of intelligence, a civics test to determine how learned one is about legal proceedings, and a no-wrong-answers test about morality. 

Selection is undertaken in a familiar manner; that of '**voire dire**', a selection process used to determine the biases within individual potential jurors. This is done via questioning the jurors, and working to determine if their background, experiences, beliefs and/or connections with the case or the parties involved might present a conflict of interest, rendering them incapable of being fair to the parties involved. Should the acting legal counsel present a tangible case why a juror should be dismissed, it is left to the panel of sitting judges to deliberate and approve or deny the decision.

A core difference is that under the Fel-Arcad, they are not given **preemptory challenges**, as their usage is rife with concealed, plausibly deniable biases.

Fel-Arcad legal scholars have always shaped the legal system such that the jury takes a slightly different approach. Fel-Arcad juries consist of **twelve members selected from the arcology or arcologies most relevant to the case**, as well as **six additional jurors** who have **lived minimally in arcologies** in their lifetime. The reason for this is that it is widely postulated arcologies breed a form of 'moral uniformity' among the Fel-Arcad that is good for running society, but may be suboptimal for judging those who flout it. Those who haven't dwelt in arcologies are thus brought on to give an otherwise unobtainable perspective. 

For the Fel-Arcad pool, they have four alternates, and two for the non-arcology pool, resulting in **twenty four jurors** in all. In cases involving multiple arcologies, the Fel-Arcad pool is divided into a larger and smaller pool, with the larger pool being drawn from the arcology the defendant is most tied to, this often being a 60% split in their favor. If three arcologies are involved, it can be split 50-25-25 in the defendant's favor. This in pursuit of the philosophy of 'jury of their peers', with peers being very much a product of the arcology one has dwelt in.

The task of the jury after their selection is, summarized, to reach a verdict. This they will do through being the audience of what could be a very long bout of legal theater. In this time, the courts and auxiliary legal institutions will work towards preserving their safety and compensating them for the time spent. In the court room they will be presented the evidence, question witnesses, discuss facts, and ultimately deliberate upon the matter. If a verdict is not reached, they will be given time to deliberate again, and again, again, until a decision is reached. In all this they are to remain fair and impartial, and work towards the delivery of justice - in whatever form that may be.

4. **Legal Codes and Statutes**
The legal codes and statutes adhered to by the Fel-Arcad are encoded in the **Arcal**, which is an expanded compendium of documents featuring material taken from the **Annals of the Eight**, **Mouths that Spit and Sing**, and **The Farseer's Lament**.

The Arcal is divided into various super-sections, sections and subsections, dealing with a litany of subject matters, civil and criminal, from the conduct of individuals to that of all Fel-Arcad. It outlines the structure of government and the extent of each branch's powers, and contains a supremacy clause that declares it the supreme doctrine the Fel-Arcad must adhere to. It contains information on how to amend the Arcal, adding additional clauses and the like where necessary; as the people who are subject to it grow and evolve, so too does the document they are subject to.

Revisions and amendments to the Arcal are made by the Fallen Justices that sit in the Rosenthal Court of the Fallen at Sanscrii. As with other decisions, a seven-two majority of the justices is needed to reach a decision on what changes should be made to the Arcal.

5. **Legal Education & Profession**
Under the advanced instruction schools umbrella are **Arcal Colleges**, where those who will work in the legal profession are trained. Here, there are specific training tracks for those who want to become lawyers, judges, jury consultants, cross-examiners, mediators, in-house counsels, various flavors of administrative staff such as court reporters, secretaries and paralegals, researchers and law educators, as well as an introductory program for those who will later train to be law enforcement at Sekatorial Camps.

Each varies in the number of years necessary to attain a state of having completed the work allotted to one and thus earn the title tied to that completion. At this, many can choose to go into public, private or individual practice for the various subfields they might find themselves drawn to.

It is from this bunch after they have obtained a fair bit of experience on many legal fronts that the judges of various courts are selected. Those interested in becoming judges can indicate their interest with the relevant bodies, and have to pass a fair bit more training and testing before they can. It is also often the case that Fel-Arcad may vote for particularly beloved figures even if they did not run for office, and as such they are strong-armed into service.

6. **Rights and Liberties**
The section of the Arcal that outlines much to all of the Fel-Arcad's rights and liberties is very much similar - as to be almost derivative - of our world's [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights). As the Fel-Arcad work towards the establishment and maintenance of a maximally egalitarian society, the creation of a fundamental outline of the shape of beings in that society was necessary, and was reached after much deliberation among thinkers and scholars over the many earliest processions of the Arcad's and later Fel-Arcad's existence.

That being said, there are some articles of the UDHR that do not carry over totally to the Fel-Arcad's own approach to shaping an optimal society.

The nature of arcology living - and in reality, the arcology model itself - has made it necessary for arcology administrative powers to be more involved in the on goings of individual Fel-Arcad and their families, in a manner that many would find to violate **Article 12**. It is no secret that arcologies are under heavy and active surveillance, often up to the doorsteps of individual residents, to maintain the optimal state of the arcology desired by those who have established the rulebooks on such things. The nontrivial results of this hasn't stopped critics of the Fel-Arcad and the arcology model, particularly scholars outside of the Fel-Arcad, from critiquing it on this point.

The construction of arcologies also means **Article 17** is under some contention. While Fel-Arcad can indeed purchase property beyond their initial allotments within an arcology, all land-related matters are ultimately subject to the whims of the Soleri, who shape the arcologies as they see fit. Compensation is indeed given to those who's land needs to be repossessed, but under most circumstances they are not exactly given a choice in the matter.

**Article 18** causes some friction on how individual arcologies choose to deal with Rosenthalist cells. Many employ the oft-cited 'paradox of tolerance' and thus make it a point to exile Rosenthalists and oppose their proliferation wherever possible. Others argue that to deny Fel-Arcad their intrinsic right to dwell within the arcologies flies in the face of doctrine spanning back to the days of the Arcad; the arcologies have always been their homes, and as a cultural and physical institution they cannot possibly be denied to Fel-Arcad, irrespective of creed, irrespective of the contents of that creed. 

It additionally raises conflicts with **Article 19**, in that while some arcologies are tolerant if not outrightly dismissive of Rosenthalist presence, they may restrict their ability to express their beliefs through avenues normally available to others, believing that containment and curtailment of Rosenthalist sentiment and its spread is necessary for the health of an arcology and its people. **Article 20** can see some infringement in this regard as well, regarding assembly.

In many cases, it is widely accepted that Rosenthalists in government is less than ideal, though the means of preventing this is up for debate. Some opt to simply fight ideas with ideas, and work towards large information campaigns to expose and criticize Rosenthalist doctrine. Some arcologies are far less inclined to this however, and choose simply to dismiss with **Article 21**, disallowing Rosenthalists from running for office, and even dismissing with the desires of a largely Rosenthalist populace. 

In some cases **Article 23** comes under minor fire. While all Fel-Arcad are guaranteed employment in some form, and fair compensation for work done, arcologies as machines have very specific needs, and individual Fel-Arcad may be more-than-persuaded to work certain jobs or professions, especially if they are directly related to the upkeep of the arcology, even if they may not be so inclined towards these positions.

The compulsion to attend arcology-run schools and thus imbibe arcology-developed curricula is seen by some to violate **Article 26**, regarding what parents can teach their descendants. Private educational arrangements or 'homeschooling' is largely frowned upon by the arcologies, and while some may not actively forbid it, and some may even provide 'educational tracks' that can be followed by those who choose that route, there are many checks and balances in place that some may argue are 'excessive', enough so to dissuade the undetermined from the entire endeavor. 

**Article 27** has been under major contention regarding the topic of intellectual property. Under most arcologies, the intellectual creations of denizens of that arcology are done under the contractual obligation that the author be author in name only, and the actual intellectual product is the property of the arcology within which it was developed, the argument being that such inventions wouldn't be possible without the conducive environment for existence provided by the arcologies. 

The boons reaped by usage of intellectual inventions are thus also the property of an arcology, and while the creators do enjoy a share, it is given as a matter of courtesy rather than compulsion, and this is widely understood by most. It isn't accepted by most though, and there are many cases of Fel-Arcad hopping to arcologies that do not enforce these rules or outside of arcologies entirely to birth their creations, which they then reap maximally from, or offer to sell them to their parent arcologies for upfront sums and additional royalties over a period. Some arcologies are more stringent about these things however, with the creations of all Fel-Arcad within them *from time of birth* being the property of the arcology they are born in. Some arcologies have employed Sekators to pursue those who try to flout this, and it has been met with proportionate criticism and condemnation, but nothing by way of outright forbiddance. 

As a note, **Article 29** ties in to - and is in fact and argument and justification for - the semblance doctrine, in that individual development and wellbeing is intricately tied to overall community health. It is for this reason that visits to the sembleworks by Fel-Arcad is largely subsidized by the arcology administration, who have come to view it as an investment into the productivity of the arcology itself.

The second part of Article 29 is also used as justification for the various infringements on other articles or so, small and large, as stated above. Coupled with one's own rights is a compulsion to respect the rights of others, and to sacrifice in some ways for the wellbeing of larger collectives.

7. **Punishment and Sentencing**
Criminal law among the Fel-Arcad is handled by their (legisjudiciary PHldr.) that is responsible for both proposing, drafting, deliberation upon, enacting and interpretation of arcology law as well as enforcement of it. These laws are written into an arcology's Arcal, the binding document of rules that all within the arcology are beheld to.

Necessary investigations and eventual punishment are handled by the Sekators, the only Fel-Arcad empowered to use violence by virtue of being specifically trained in its just application. 

When a jury reaches a verdict in a Fel-Arcad trial, they have the opportunity to either determine the severity of the punishment among themselves, or waive that right and leave sentencing to the judges overseeing the case.

Most punishments given down by Fel-Arcad courts are tempered by the fact the Fel are a philosophically-mandated pacifistic people, and thus many would consider their punishments 'soft'. Financial penalties such as fines or reductions in monetary allotments, uncompensated work, restriction of freedoms within the arcology such as access to various facilities, temporary exile - or in the worst cases - permanent exile, encompasses the majority of punishment methods afforded to the Fel-Arcad. Many families and groups within and outside of the Fel-Arcad have criticized the Fel-Arcad as 'too lenient', met with counterarguments in the form of mentioning how most 'harsher' methods are incompatible with their doctrine.

This has led to many instances of slighted Fel-Arcad who felt the punishment dealt to their offenders didn't nearly match the gravity of the offence committed, and they may be driven to seek recourse on their own terms, enacting a personal brand of justice. Exiles from an arcology may find themselves being pursued, either by their former victims who choose self-imposed exile or sneaking out of the arcology to hunt them down, or hired hands to keep their own hands clean. Feljourn in particular are invaluable for this task, their shifted, hardened perspectives shaped by living in the star-wilds makes them intrinsically understanding of seeking justice one's own way.

There are of course arcologies that embrace harsher methods of punishment, including imprisonment and occasionally even the death penalty, obtaining a mixed - but mostly disapproving - reception, by the wider Fel-Arcad community. Studies naturally exist for either side of this divide, arguing for one method over the other. Rosenthalists in particular favor harsher approaches.

8. **Legal Institutions**
The auxiliary non-court legal institutions such as law enforcement agencies and correctional facilities are the domain of an arcology's **Sekators**. Being the only Fel-Arcad allowed to perform acts of violence within tightly-controlled bounds, they are thus necessary at various stages in the legal process, such as arrests, investigations, moving relevant parties from locale to locale, protection of relevant parties, case-relevant materials such as evidence, and the physical locations relevant to cases, such as crime scenes and the actual court building.

In addition, the Sekators enforce whatever sentence is levied against the convict. Exiles and imprisonments are overseen by the Sekators, and in arcologies where more severe methods are employed, the Sekators oversee these as well.

It is worth noting that the monopoly the Sekators have over violence thus makes them uniquely liable for excessive harms done in its usage, established through continuous reviews of Sekator conduct by relevant bodies.

9. **Appeals and Review**
It is the right of all Fel-Arcad who are dissatisfied with a ruling to escalate the matter in the form of an appeal to a higher court. This is only doable when circumstances facilitate it however, and these circumstances must be established in the form of an appeal proposal.

If it can be established, for example, that there were considerable errors made in proceedings by various parties, this is grounds for an appeal. Other grounds include errors of procedure and process, allegations of bias, excessive sentencing, conflict of law and jurisdiction, and the appearance of new evidence. When a case is sufficiently made, the next court on the ladder can take the case up for review.

The conclusive list for grounds of appeal is as follows;
- Errors of Law
- Misconduct or Bias
- Procedural Errors
- New Evidence
- Inadequate Legal Representation
- Excessive or Inappropriate Sentencing
- Errors in Jury Instructions
- Constitutional Violations
- Jurisdictional Issues
- Abuse of Discretion
- Conflict of Laws
- Errors in Findings of Fact

While measures are taken to curtail each of these, the system - even the Fel-Arcad's - is imperfect, and as such it is important that measures exist to demand lookovers of various legal decisions.

The highest court among the Fel-Arcad is the Rosenthal Court of the Fallen, and their decision is final.

10. **On Jurisdiction**
The jurisdiction of an arcology is often a point of contention. Generally, it is accepted that the jurisdiction of an arcology ends at the physical end of the arcadia it is situated within, a boundary between legally-bound space and the unclaimed waters that remains fairly static as arcadias are often programmed to stop growing once a desired size is reached.

Fel-Arcad generally make it a point not to punish offenders for crimes against them if those offenders are not subject to arcology jurisdiction. A crime committed by a non-Fel against a Fel-Arcad within the bounds of arcology space is handled by that arcology under the Nadiran High Court, and punishment is meted out to the offender by the arcology's administration due to the fact visiting an arcology is done with the awareness and thus acceptance of being bound by arcology law. 

Offences committed outside an arcology's jurisdiction against a member of that arcology are handled somewhat differently. Investigations are carried out to find the nature of the offence and those involved, and then this information is passed over the arcology's External Affairs. External Affairs works closely with the NHC and contacts relevant parties that the perpetrator is subject too - such as another arcology in the case of a Fel-Arcad offender - and issues their demands regarding a desire for punishment and the degree of severity in its dispensation. Noncompliance is met with sanctions from the Fel-Arcad, often in the form of trade refusal by the relevant arcology and other arcologies that feel so inclined. The economic value of the Fel-Arcad sees that their demands are often answered sooner rather than later.

#### The Sekators
An arcology's fighting force is its Sekators; trained Fel-Arcad solely empowered to utilize violence. Securing a given arcology and the Fel-Arcad within from internal and external threats summarizes their charge fairly well. While the Sekators tend to thus being fiercely loyal to Fel-Arcad kin, this loyalty has led many to strike out against enemies of the Fel-Arcad often without adequate clearance, especially as means to right wrongs done by other parties, and out of the frustration with External Affair's methods of dialogue and cajoling. There are many cases where an offender simply vanishes, and External Affairs and the party representing the offender are left with no real way to proceed, more than abundantly aware of what caused such a disappearance. 

In cases where it is clear someone has taken matters of justice into their own hand, it is declared that 'the unknowable forces of cause and effect have issued us what we interpret to mean justice' and often, the matter ends there. Arcologies have found themselves in dire straits after Sekators or other parties acted out of line before, however, thus the practice is heavily frowned upon, though this hardly does the work necessary to curtail the pursuit of restoring pride in one's own people. 

### 18. Politics & Economy
#### Politics & Governance
Within each arcology is their seat of governance, the structure and workings of which are outlined in the **Arcal**, the Fel-Arcad's constitutional document, assembled from various other works that make up the larger body of the Fey Curlicue works of literature. In structuring their government, the Fel-Arcad adhered to a number of familiar principles, including having a constitutional backing, insistence upon the Rule of Law, free elections under a representative democracy, and the separation of powers. While political theory-crafters continue to study the systems in place and work upon their improvement where necessary, they have reached a fairly workable state over many processions.

Below thus, are notes on the subject, outlining the various intricacies surrounding Fel-Arcad and arcology government.

##### Governmental Structure
For the purposes of analysis we shall look at what can be called a 'baseline' for an arcology's governmental structure. This baseline is built off of a number of presuppositions, these being in particular regarding the demographic makeup of the arcology. The baseline thus refers to an arcology that is majorly Nadiran in population and philosophy, in that they reject Rosenthalist thought and operate on principles outlined by the ArcDanseer Nadira, such as the Semblance Doctrine and conscientious objection to violence unless critically necessary. Certain skews are made to the baseline 

With that established, we may then look at the structure of Fel-Arcad government. Collectively, it is known as the **Rozencraun**, and it is a five-armed model that sees each arm handle individual, differing aspects of an arcology;

- Executive - the **Craun Tenders**
- Legislature and Judiciary - the **Craun Justiciars**
- External Affairs - the **Circuit of Extra-Arcology Relations**
- Military and Law Enforcement - the **Sekatariat**
- Arcology Management - the **Craun Soleri**

**The Craun Tenders**
An arcology's High Tenders are its highest authority excluding all checks and balances that may be imposed by other arms. Separated in the **High, Mediate and Low Tenders**, each strata presides over a number of executive functions within the arcology. 

The **High Tenders** can number between three and five, and serve functions not dissimilar from the role of a president in other systems. They are the arcology's chief executives, and generally if a matter needs to be addressed and actions taken as a result, they are the ones who make it possible. In particular their functions are on matters of;

- Administration
- Economics
- Crisis Management
- External Relations and Diplomacy
- Military Proposals
- Ceremonial Duties

And a number of other duties that generally require a high, tightly-knit authority to make decisions that affect the entirety of an arcology and those within it. The fragmentation of Fel-Arcad governmental power does mean that the High Tenders must consult and can even have their actions constrained by other bodies within the Rozencraun, but in a majority of cases, they are able to take actions relatively unchallenged, this efficiency of decision-making necessary for running the arcologies.

The **Mediate Tenders** are a large group of high-level personnel for various administrative agencies and departments. Ministries on larger arcology subject matters such as employment and labor, the sembleworks, trade, education, manufacturing, health, immigration, information and technology, naval matters; persistent committees on various smaller matters, and purpose-built task forces to address brief, but highly important, rapidly emerging issues. These middle-managers of sorts are essential for the smooth operating of the Rozencraun, and they work in tandem with the many other arms of government towards the overall stability of the arcology.

The **Lower Tenders** refers to a class of 'civil servants' of sorts, who work sometimes directly under the High and Mediate Tenders as various flavors of administrative staff. When a Fel-Arcad has dealings with the Rozencraun, their first encounter is with these Lower Tenders, who are the cogs of the entire machine as well as the lubricant that keeps the entire ensemble functioning. 

**The Craun Justiciars**
> Their functions are thrashed fairly thoroughly under the [[The Fel-Arcad#Fel-Arcad Law|Fel-Arcad Law]] section of this document, and to repeat what is said there would be redundant.

The highest legal and judicial authorities within an arcology are its **High Justiciars**, a body of eight veteran legal scholars who warm the benches of an arcology's Nadiran High Court. Their function is primarily administrative and that of review, assessing the decisions made by lower courts, as well as the actions taken by various other arms of the Rozencraun. In matters where they are not actively handling legal cases, they are called the **Arbiter-Administrators**, colloquially shortened to '**Arbads**'.

In this manner they serve as a check to the others' power. A vast majority of the decisions made by the rest of the Rozencraun is subject to legal review, and in fact many of such actions taken must receive some kind of sign-off or general approval from those working within the Justiciar. This has of course led to criticism, in the form of "Who polices the police?" and every answer being just another, higher-ranking policing authority has been understandably regarded as no answer at all.

One of their additional functions include the fact the role of federal pardons that would normally be the domain of the President or their analogue is instead left to the decision of the High Justiciars. While requests for these pardons can be made by other arms of the Rozencraun in the form of formal applications outlining reasons why, the final say is left to the High Justiciars.

Matters of elections and polls are also handled by the Justiciar, and indeed an entire sub-body exists for the calling and conduction of decision-making exercises that involve the wider arcology. 

**The Circuit of Extra-Arcology Relations**
This arm of the Rozencraun has earned its name from the physical architecture of its buildings in general; that of stacked 'rings' within which various offices and other relevant infrastructure are placed. The Circuit is headed by the **Circuit Director** and the **Office of the Circuit**, and within the arcologies they are tasked with matters of relations with other parties in the Switchboard.

Working just under the Office of the Circuit and the Director - in hierarchy and often also in physical building layout - is the **Circuit of Ambassadors**, which refers to a collection of high-ranking authorities that work as liaisons with individual arcologies and various other entities in the Switchboard. In particular these are;

- **Major Entities**
	- The Arcology at Sanscrii
	- The Sil'khan
	- The Lancasters
	- The Vahnkin
- **Minor Entities**
	- Spyndl Academy
	- Lancaster Innovations
	- The Starwylds (a blanket term for the Feljourn, Sil'khan nomads, and various other flavors of star-journeying Danciran denizen) 
	- The Rosenthalists

In nearly all matters that involve parties outside of the arcology in question, the Circuit is in charge of dealings and resolution, and they work in tandem with the other arms of the Rozencraun on issues relevant to them; the Craun Tenders on dealings with other top-level authorities and decisions that affect non-Arcad peoples, the Justiciar on legal cases involving non-Arcad, the Sekatariat on matters of defense and rarely, offense, and the Soleri's Craun Sanctum on matters revolving around the physical structure of the arcology itself and the arcadia that surrounds it, and how they may affect others in their vicinity. 

It is thus also often the case that some of these ambassadorial figures are missing from the Circuit, due to a number of reasons - and few of them savory. 

The Circuit also handles arcology migration, both in and out of the arcology. Those coming in to the arcology as visitors are monitored, and those coming in to the arcology to request a place to stay will be subjected to a number of tests and vetting procedures to ascertain whether they'll be a good fit for the Fel-Arcad environment. Those voluntarily leaving the arcology and those being exiled are also processed by the Circuit.

**The Sekatariat**
The Sekatariat oversees an arcology's Sekators, Fel-Arcad uniquely empowered to use violence, under the principles outlined in *Mouths that Spit and Sing*. Under their command are all Sekatorial instruction institutions - these being the Sekator Camps - the arcology's law enforcement, and the arcology's external defense corps. 

The Sekatariat's **Cabinet of Strife** consists of the **Arasaya**. the **Araken**, and a hand-picked roundtable of veterans in the studies relevant to their duties as Sekators. The Arasaya is the default leader of the Sekatariat, and their standpoint is in fact, one of non-violence. It is the task of the Araken and the Cabinet to sway them from this position, and actually convince them that a certain matter requires the deployment of the Sekators.

Actions taken by the Sekatariat are often subject to review by the Justiciar, and there are times when the Sekatariat must be mobilized against the Rozencraun itself. Situations like this may often devolve into external arcologies having to intervene in the affairs of the one in question. These inter-arcology conflicts are fairly uncommon, but it is not unheard of that conflicts in the Sekatariat can lead to decisions being made that earn the disapproval of Justiciar review authorities. For this reason, the Sekatariat is widely known to have some of the shortest-serving leaders and staff, as almost every Justiciar review body can find some means to decry a choice made by the Arasaya as hasty, unneeded, and not thoroughly thought out.

**The Craun Soleri**
When an arcology is newly being seeded, the Soleri building it act as the proto-Rozencraun until a fully-established proper Rozencraun can be established. Even when this is achieved, the Craun Soleri maintain their authority in all manners concerning the physical structure of the arcology and its surrounding arcadia. The **Craun Sanctum** is the arcology's highest Soleri Sanctum, and thus in charge of maintenance, growth and - if necessary - decommissioning of the arcology structure.

The **Nai'sol of the Craun Sanctum** are a number of highly trained, veteran Soleri who manage its affairs, working alongside the lower **Du'sol** who serve an number of functions ranging from administration, to aiding in planning trimming or growths, to physical growing of the arcology, through programming replichrome and trimming where necessary. 

Most of their interaction with the other arms of the Rozencraun are restrained to the Craun Tenders, as while the Soleri maintain the arcology, it is the Tenders with their executive powers that decide how the internal space of the arcology is used. When rearrangements need to be made, it is done with the Craun Soleri and Craun Tenders working in tandem.

##### Further Notes
Further notes relevant to the matter of Fel-Arcad governance.
> Further or precursor reading in the form of [[The Fel-Arcad#Fel-Arcad Law|Fel-Arcad Law]] is encouraged.

**Electoral Civics**
The Rozencraun exists as a representative democracy, with individual Fel-Arcad voting for their leaders when the time arises for such to occur. Arcologies as structures are subdivided under physical and social lines; arcologies themselves being divided into **wings** or **branches**, these being divided into **districts**, and districts being divided into **blocs**. Blocs are further divided by social lines, into clans, families and individuals.

These units of Fel-Arcad social measure are invoked often when electoral and decision-making instances. In most matters, Fel-Arcad are dealt with as blocs and districts, with the members of each unit having the majority vote under their representative umbrella counting as the vote for their unit.

It goes without saying that with much of the Fel-Arcad arcology running process heavily involving the votes and contributions of many, it is thus paramount that the fairness and sanctity of the electoral process be upheld. The intricacies of calcic dynamics are used, with each Fel-Arcad voting with unfalsifiable chalk ribbon created from the stuff of their lattice at birth, and electoral counting is often done by other arcologies or handled by non-human actors, the entire process being done calcically.

On the note of voting chalk ribbon, and perhaps on the note of the functionality of arcologies in general, civic participation and general participation in Fel-Arcad society is necessary for both Fel-Arcad electoral civics and arcology functioning as a whole. Mentioned and discussed endlessly by Fel-Arcad social architects is that the arcology model is necessarily collectivist and indeed requires many individual elements working selflessly to guarantee its functioning. For many, this is criticized as a flaw, but also understood as something with no real work-around that doesn't undermine or compress the integrity of the arcology model.

**Constitutional Framework - the Arcal**
All of Fel-Arcad law and guiding principles is outlined in the **Arcal**, the works of the Curlicue it derives its foundation from, and the various derivative works that emerge from it. Each arcology possesses their own individual Arcal, all of build off of the central, baseline arcology that is housed and thus dictated by the legal scholars of the Second Arcology at Sanscrii. The various writings within the Arcal dictate Fel-Arcad conduct, from individual behavior to the building of nation-states.

All of Fel-Arcad society is built with the Arcal as its backbone; it enshrines the rights, privileges and responsibilities of Fel-Arcad the stars-over and the powers and function of the Rozencraun government. It enshrines the rule of law, the protection if individual rights and the procedures of its own amendment. Above all, the Arcal declares its own supremacy, given that power and relevance by the Fel-Arcad who write it, and the Fel-Arcad subject to it.

**Egalitarianism in Word and Deed**
The enshrinement of the rule of law in the Arcal declares all Fel-Arcad to be equal to one another, in the eyes of both other Fel-Arcad and the various institutions under the Fel-Arcad umbrella. For this reason, the fabric of Fel-Arcad - more specifically, arcology - society is built around upholding this equality, and working towards more equal shapes of society in general.

It is for this reason that the Fel-Arcad generally reject Rosenthalist thinking, the structure of Vahnkin society, and - despite being good allies - much of Sil'khan thought about the placement of persons in society as well. To various extents these philosophies are judged to have non-trivial deviations from Fel-Arcad conclusions about the equality of beings in the Switchboard, and thus face critique in Fel-Arcad circles.

In actual practice, various systems exist towards this end, ranging from policies such as universal basic incomes, social safety nets, free education and healthcare, wealth redistribution, community engagement and individual empowerment and the like. Much of this is due to the necessity of a general sense of equality for all actors as regards the operation of arcologies. No single individual can be worth more than another under the arcology model, and the model needs all individuals acting with this in mind for it to succeed.

This is naturally met with considerable criticism even from Fel-Arcad themselves, who inevitably come across moment after moment in which some action they would've have liked to take, or pleasure they could have enjoyed must be foregone as the arcology model demands it. It faces continuous criticism on how arcologies incentivize laziness, kill drive, stifle innovation, encourage a form of self-absorbed hedonism, and generally breed all manners of vices. It has led many Fel-Arcad to leave the arcologies and become Feljourn, living nomadic lives under a differing definition of freedom, declaring the arcologies as antithetical to that philosophy. 

The vectors of critique vary; the Rosenthalists, Vahnkin, Feljourn and Sil'khan all espouse differing extents of the same view, that being the relative inequality of kin. The Rosenthalist and Vahnkin entertain a version of this idea that stems from birth, and the Feljourn and Sil'khan espouse one dictated by deed. It is because the Fel-Arcad entertain the Sil'khan and Feljourn as allies that they are far more inclined towards entertaining their antithetical philosophy, and there is much debate between them on whether it is possible to raise the value of any individual being. The Sil'khan believe so as a matter of nigh-religious creed; that the ontology of beings in the Switchboard is in constant flux, and that 'value' according to calcic yardsticks is accumulated through living and the actions taken while living. The Feljourn believe this but to a lesser extent; espousing a more utilitarian view of the word where a being that can wield a hammer is greater than one who cannot.

The Lancasters espouse a mix of both; believing both in high-born and low-born heritage, as well as rejecting the hand that one is dealt in favor of forging one's own path. That the heights one can go are dictated by the circumstances of birth - but only loosely - and that the driven, dedicated and disciplined are more than capable of reaching the utmost heights allotted to them, and even breaking past that ceiling to transcend it.

The Fel-Arcad reject all, embracing an oft-declared 'naïve' idealism, that sees them striving towards shaping the Switchboard where such dynamics of the value of beings or the lack thereof are unnecessary. Beings can simply be, and be to the utmost extent that they are inclined towards, without worrying about whether their being is valuable in manners that satisfy primordial ledgers or within-scarcity societies. 

**On Rights, Freedoms and Responsibilities**
The Fel-Arcad Arcal enshrines the various rights and freedoms enjoyed by arcology-dwelling Fel-Arcad and other Fel-Arcad beyond the arcologies. It is generally accepted and enforced that freedoms and rights in particular cannot be curtailed or denied except under gross circumstances, and even then it is subject to the decision of relevant authorities, and after-the-fact criticism by other authorities. Generally, the curtailment of certain more physical freedoms is made possible by the Sekators, who are trained to handle such affairs with utmost delicacy and effectiveness, the crux of their training being striking the balance between those two. By design, their every action is criticized, and while it is viewed by man as excessive, it is also accepted as the only means by which they can improve.

Coupled with rights and freedoms are responsibilities, spawned primarily from the nature of the arcology model. As a collectivist institution, the arcology demands selfless mass cooperation from all involved to succeed, and this requires an innate understanding of what one must do and not do at all times. All Fel-Arcad are responsible in some manner or another for the operation and upkeep of their host arcology, both in deliberate actions and deliberate inaction. Enforcement of these responsibilities remains a continuous topic of debate, with no conclusive answers beyond the continuous push to foster a sense of unity among arcology dwellers, and thus obligation towards facilitating that unity.

One of the ways responsibilities manifest is in occupation, in that all Fel-Arcad are expected to work in some regard, and are additionally given various options on what work they wish to do. It is generally understood that much work is hard and lacking in glamour, and thus there must be considerable incentive in place to ensure that it gets done. Approaches vary, from acceptance of the nature of work as a sort of necessary evil, and thus it must be counterbalanced with the various 'goods' provided by arcology living, to a somewhat stricter strategy of sticks rather than carrots - though within the realms of Fel-Arcad punitive philosophy.

#### The Fel-Arcad Economy
Outlined in many of the Fey Curlicue's texts were notes on the matter of economics; how it shaped the other great families in the earliest Switchboard, and the star-spanning effects it would have in the near and distant futures. For this reason, the Arcad and Fel-Arcad over time have theory-crafted and tested various models and approaches to this problem, in order to minimize ills while still reaping the benefits of trade in general. 

##### The Fel-Arcad Economy & The Wider Switchboard
How does the Fel-Arcad economy work?

In a sense, this is a question of how chalk and its mechanics affect everyday living in the Switchboard. More specifically put, the ability for rituals to create things from chalk has had a significant effect on the existence of things *at all* in the Switchboard, and is the crux of the reason why the Fel-Arcad play so essential a role in the wider Switchboard and in particular why arcologies are able to maintain their incredibly high standards of living - speaking on their welfare states, for example.

Individual arcologies and the Fel-Arcad as a whole are the Switchboard's largest producer of a wide selection of goods, all through their ability to fabricate these things through the calcic ritualism. This also means that arcologies consume massive amounts of chalk in their upkeep alone, to talk less of the massive production demands they meet. This chalk can't be obtained from a region or from its latent chalk, as even small arcologies would vacuum up all the chalk in a regions atmosphere in mere days of operation. As such, this chalk needs to be supplied from elsewhere.

Fortunately, where there is demand, supply rises to meet it. **Lancaster Innovations**, inarguably the Dancirah's largest conglomerate of somewhat profit-minded individuals and groups, exists to meet this demand. By establishing colossal mining encampments on Wellsprings and commanding massive fleets of cargo-hauling spacefaring vessels, massive crystalline deposits are cut from Wellsprings and supplied to arcologies as requested, delivered by the metric ton. This supply of chalk serves to upkeep the arcologies, maintaining the Fel-Arcad's high standard of living, as well as allow them to play their own economic role.

Mirroring this, the Fel-Arcad supply most of the Dancirah's calcic goods, due wholly to their unrivalled skill with the calcic ritualism. Almost all calcic *anything* is manufactured - spun from chalk ribbon - by the Fel-Arcad arcologies. This in turn earns them Lancaster-issued currency, which the vast majority of the Switchboard operates upon. The External Affairs and Executive arms of an arcology handle this.

> External Affairs and Executive are PHldr names. Refer back when final names are acquired.

These calcic goods are then handed over in bulk to Lancaster Innovations, who partners with arcologies and acts as a distributor of them on an interstellar scale, paying back the arcologies a share of the revenue earned. Additionally, arcologies sell to smaller parties such as the Sil'khan and the Feljourn, both individuals and small groups. The handling of all things calcic done by the arcologies sees a general trend of outsourcing these thing to them, such as the Spyndl Academy leaving the handling of all their rituals and calcic equipment manufacture to partnered arcologies, generating further revenue. 

Deviating from explicit commerce, the Fel-Arcad are also great sellers of their knowledge and talents to those willing to pay a fee. Many from all over the Switchboard come to arcologies to learn the calcic ritualism from the best practitioners of it at a Versit, or to ask for a ritual to be carried out for them, a ritual schema to be created, for consultation on improving existing ones, and plenty come to make use of the Sembleworks, either for similar reasons as the Fel-Arcad themselves, cosmetic reasons, or to give themselves various bodily upgrades, the latter a very common practice by Academy Operators.

The Fel-Arcad also maintain immensely vast and comprehensive libraries on ritual schema. While ritual schema can be acquired from a number of sources, there is always a fair bit of risk involved, coming from the fact that ritual schema could have various covert elements built into them that wouldn't be apparent to an untrained Weaver. The Fel-Arcad offer trust, in the form of assurance that their libraries contain ritual schema that in most cases, have been cast at least once, and thus can be confidently said to have no unscrupulous elements built into them. Access to these libraries is fairly restricted, and those who are even approved for entry have a pretty penny to pay. In addition to storing rituals schema, the Fel-Arcad over their services in developing them - also at considerable cost - to interested parties. 

Though not nearly to the degree of the Sil'khan, the Fel-Arcad pride themselves on being dealers in information, particularly information that has 'aged' or refers to ancient subject matter in the Switchboard. Usually this provision of information is contractual with a clause attached that benefits the Fel-Arcad; if the information provided is a map to a relic, the Fel-Arcad contract-giver generally expect you to bring it back. Refusing to do so can be met with a refusal to do further business with the offending party at that arcology and other arcologies, or worse, hired bounty hunters going after the offender.

Internal handling of an arcology's wealth is down by its Executive, who compute incoming revenue, outgoing expenses and generally handle all accounting. They also handle how this wealth is spent and distributed among the Fel-Arcad, allotments being issued to various sectors and parties as necessary. 

##### Notes on Employment & Arcology Economies
Arcologies and Fel-Arcad society at large functions via the smooth operation of various interconnected systems, which in more cases than not would benefit from the presence and overall handling by a Fel-Arcad operator. With how pre-planned Fel-Arcad physical infrastructure is, it is fairly simple to determine the exact kind and size of workforce needed to operate an arcology, made possible by the social-architecture mathematics practiced by the Soleri. As arcologies expand or shrink or generally change, these changes are accounted for and the values shift, the operating staff of an arcology always being something with a relatively exact value.

For this reason it is thus a fairly simple task to form the workforce of an arcology, and assign roles to various Fel-Arcad dwelling within. The Craun Tenders work with our-world union analogues to assemble rotating workforces, as Fel-Arcad are not expected to work the same profession (unless otherwise desired) for extended, concurrent periods of time (unless otherwise desired). The Soleri's calculus makes it possible to design a maximally efficient workforce, such that no more than is absolutely necessary are working at any given time, factoring in the work that needs to be done, and the determined capacity of individual members of the workforce to perform work.

On the point of rotating workforces, at intervals in a procession - usually at the Radiance Cycle seasons - the workforce is reshuffled in a number of manners. Varying from arcology to arcology, Fel-Arcad are expected to perform a number of seasonal 'shifts' in a procession, these being allotments of days determined by a fixed value modified by capability assessments and the Fel-Arcad's own wishes. With time slots chosen, they are allowed to choose or are given the profession or role they are expected to perform for the time. This stage of seasonal rotations often sees a fair bit of contention, as some individuals are better suited for some tasks, and it is entirely possible to have a season where many want to be cooks and none want to be cleaners. In these instances, selection is opened up to off-season workers, who are offered the less desired positions at increased wages. Generally, most Fel-Arcad will have upwards of a third of an entire profession to themselves, doing virtually zero compelled work, a structure put in place from the earliest days of the Arcad, and penned down in *The Farseer's Lament*.

This system is what applies to what can be called an arcology's public sector, that is, work that directly serves the Rozencraun. The Fel-Arcad private sector employs somewhat different employment methodology. Most private sector firms in arcology's cannot do any hiring themselves, and instead apply for workers and employees through the Rozencraun's relevant employment authorities - a measure put in place to curb bias and nepotism as well as ensure the protections of worker's rights. While arcology's very much do have markets, the question of their 'freeness' is up for debate, as the Rozencraun puts regulation in place to prevent runaway profiteering, as well as provides generic but quality alternatives to the privately-produced goods on the market at reduced prices, to better serve Fel-Arcad with less income beyond the universal stipend provided to all of them. Policy prevents the rise of monopolies and anti-competition practices, the proliferation of substandard goods, exploitation of workers, runaway inflation, and environmental damage from production, ensuring the wellbeing of workers and non-workers as well as tidy profits for Fel-Arcad who feel so inclined. 

##### Notes on Governmental Corruption
It is nearly non-existent, as the systems employed by the Fel-Arcad make it simply too difficult to steal unnoticed. The grandest schemes are defeated by virtue of needing multiple accomplices, and the socialization of the Fel-Arcad has instilled a sense of obligation to the arcology and each other, that is wholly incompatible with illicit wealth-hoarding. Corruption only truly works if the entirety of the Rozencraun is in on it, and it then results in the internal squabbles characteristic of a band of thieves. Arcologies rarely ever reach this state, and when they do, their denizens often simply leave or ask another arcology to intervene. What follows next is unceremonious collapse.

##### On Currency
 > Indev, the running idea is that Lancaster Innovation mints the cross-Dancirah currency, and each arcology has their own internally regulated currency.

**Problem List**
1. Isolationist nature of arcology living, which has resulted in Fel-Arcad being fairly unlearned on the dealings of the other families in the Switchboard, as well as lacking socialization skills.
2. Congestion and forced community.
3. Semblance philosophy is very self-absorbed, leading many Fel-Arcad to be incredibly self-centered and preoccupied primarily with their own lives.
4. Leaving arcologies is frowned upon.
5. Pacifistic philosophy is fairly unaligned with the rest of the Switchboard.
6. Arcologies taken over by unscrupulous actors elements become nexuses for unsavory things in the Switchboard.
7. Active conflict with the Vahnkin due to the actions of Antamara, which grow increasingly more bold and violent.
8. The Rosenthalists remain an ever-present threat, particularly to the Sil'khan, and their ideology of conquest of the Switchboard has begun appealing to more and more Fel-Arcad.
9. Very large 'calcic eugenics' concerns through extensive usage of the Conjugation and sembleworks tech. Some arcologies and sembleworkers already have embraced working towards the engineering of perfect descendants.
> Add apparatus for maximizing the utility and outcomes for the Conjugat under 'Technology'
10. Elimination of most minor and even major threats to day-to-day living has made the Fel-Arcad a very 'tender' people.
11. The Fel-Arcad population as a whole is aging, due to most younger Fel leaving the arcologies to join the Feljourn and organizations like the Spyndl Academy, while those who are left behind are not having children while living for extended periods.
