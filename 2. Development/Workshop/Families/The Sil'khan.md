# The Sil'khan
When the Danseers had fought and won the place of the Third Kin in the Dancirah, they could never have foreseen at the time that it would be at the cost of their own lives. Reborn from the salvaged backbone-weave of their kin, the Sil'khan boast mastery of the Strider Protocol and dominance over the Great Sky. Zealously nomadic kin of nigh-gods, their Silken Writ proclaims that the only life with any meaning is one spent cultivating strength, jaunting between stars, and building a legacy of discovery and conquest.

### Rough Outline
### Snap Thoughts
Spur of the moment thoughts that could use work.

**Danseer Ancestor-Kin Names**
Established idea; out of their great understanding of these things, the Fel-Arcad selected nine to twelve Danseers from which to build the Sil'khan peoples. These Danseers in true Switchboard fashion bore a name, aspect and had some lore associated with them and how they shaped the Sil'khan civilization, as when the new Sil'khan were born, the Danseers served as their parents, and educated them in their skills and doctrine.

- This particular bit is best elaborated upon in the **Ancestral Histories & Mythologies** section. 
- I also want to use this section - regarding the names - to make some calls to things I've liked over the years, though subtle, such as having a 'Danseer Karatross' as a light call to the Alchemaster.

**Nomad Classes**
The Sil'khan are nomads but how so? I've had an idea of dividing them into the nomad 'purists' and the nomad... something else. We'll call them the alphas and betas.

Nomad alphas are Sil'khan who ascribe to nomadic living in a purer form, defined by living light, travelling light, and having an almost religious slant to their nomadic living. Their nomadism is worship to the Danseers almost, both their ancestor-kin and the Skydancers that fought for all Third Kin. They are preoccupied with seeing, discovering, hopping from one region to the next, one star to the next, and their aims while on individual regions vary from group to group. Some are nomadic evangelists - spreading the word of the Nine Skydancers and serving the Third Kin through their immense proficiency with the SProt, others are nomadic conquerors, who believe that the victory won by their ancestor-kin grants them the entire Switchboard as their birthright. 

The Nomad betas are Sil'khan who are also nomads, but less so through the SProt, and more through command of fleets of spacefaring ships. These Sil'khan fleets amble through the Dancirah and serve as hubs for Sil'khan and others throughout the Switchboard. Often, they serve militaristic purposes, projecting immense amounts of force in stellar space. These fleets and the Sil'khan on them - though they do still hold their Danseer ancestors in high regard - busy themselves with pursuits more in the present, such as trade and commerce, personal study and development, occupations and leisurely pursuits, and exploratory outings. These Sil'khan are 'worldlier' in that regard.

#### 'The King of Roads'
Most prominent of the myths is that of the King of Roads, a figure rumored to be the first Strider. He is rumored to have the fastest Stride Velocity in all the Switchboard, some even suspecting he can move at the speed of light. He is also rumored to have made tens of millions of sojourns across the Switchboard, and the first few Starcharts containing the first established paths are rumored to be his own creation.

His unattainable Stride Velocity has made him elusive, and though many swear to have seen trails of a Strider moving across the Switchboard at speeds that could only have been his, none have been able to catch up with him. Organizations such as the Academy have given him an alphanumeric callsign: '1P0XC' or one-point-zero times c, the speed of light.

	The consequences of travelling at light speed are too many to count. While the King is thought to travel at light-speed (due to the fact no one has ever caught up with him) in actuality he simply moves at speeds immensely close to it. 
	
His Starcharts are particularly valuable as they revealed unknown safe paths through the Switchboard, as well as secretive regions of interest to Striders. In the early Switchboard, they were an essential component of the endeavors of the first few Striders. They are highly coveted naturally, and while reproductions exist of the known ones, it is suspected thousands more exist, scattered throughout the Switchboard.

In addition to Starcharts he is believed to hoard all manners of Teks, Relics, rituals and equations and all manners of things acquired in his endless travels. Many believe that all things there ever was are known by the King, making him not just the fastest Strider, but the strongest by the virtue of Knowing.

It became commonplace then, for Striders to swear by the King, staking the truthfulness of their words on the most powerful Strider there could possibly be. Some began performing gestures akin to prayer, asking the King of Roads to grant safe passage across the Switchboard, to still the flux storms, clear the paths forward, keep instruments tuned, all to guarantee safe passage. Taken further, some gave gifts and offerings, firing objects they imagine will be valued by the King (such as Starcharts) into the depths of the Switchboard, in hope that he encounters them in their travels, and in return, keeps the skies clear.

As such, the King of Roads holds a place of cultural significance in Strider society.
