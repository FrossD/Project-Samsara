# The Strider Protocol
The real actual Strider Protocol, it's nature, mechanics, ramifications and mythos.

## Preamble
The Strider Protocol is the crystallization of the human desire to be free.

Put more properly, the Strider Protocol outlines the steps that make a Strider. It is a set of rules, doctrine, criteria, methodology, that governs a state of being. Most simply, the Strider Protocol has only one singular precept; a mind may escape it's bounds and gain the capacity to understand the true nature of information. All other things follow suit.

The 'Strider Protocol' as an act is the highest form of freedom. Portrayed most elementarily, it is Near-Light-Speed travel. A Strider without need for anything other than the understanding of the true nature of information, is able to manipulate their information so as to cross vast distances functionally instantaneously. The ability to do so simultaneously conquered all current frontiers, awakening new ones to pursue.

The freedom granted by the Strider Protocol and the power granted by understanding the true nature of information awoke Striders to the secrets that had always been out of reach. Powers in mundane things, the esoteric secrets that had always been out of reach, the magnificent things that could be experienced lay too far away, the Strider Protocol granted access to this and more.

It is captured in [[The Skywards Pursuit]]; the charge given to man had always been to explore, to launch out into an unknown, expansive deep, to seek knowledge and understanding for the sake of a tangible good. The Strider Protocol is that charge. It is that noble ambition transformed from mere word and feeling to tangible power.

There was an inevitable deification of the Striders and the Strider Protocol. The mere act of knowing made one more than others, and knowing more made a Strider even *more* than they initially were. Striders grasped quickly their potential to become like deities, the path for doing so being obvious; discovery of greater and greater hidden things. This relentless pursuit characterizes Striders; newborn gods leaving their weaning of milk, leaving in search of meat, by means of their holy velocities.

The Strider Protocol, by means of providing a path to power, guarantees the freedom of those who wield it, as well as it being a manifestation of the desire to be free as well. The path to power is through learning, and learning is done through exploration, further deepening its ties with human nature. To Stride is to imbibe values of humanity in their most distilled state. 

	But what *IS* the Strider Protocol? Currently, the SProt is an immensely complex equation baked into the lattiece of Striders, that facilitates Striding as one of the many powers it grants, and as an extension of its actual function - granting the power to interact with chalk at the ribbon level in the form of the WeaveProt, Teks and Rituals.

## Mechanics
### Information Affinity

^6075ff

The first truth realized is becoming aware of Information Tangibility, that all things, including the self, are composed of information. The second truth usually realized is Information Affinity. Understanding of the information that exists in naturally allows drawing it towards the self. ^a39ed7

This unharnessed information (chalk) is used by Striders for most of their information powers. This unharnessed power is stored in the 'potential' Chalk line (as described in [[The Hands as Chalk]]) until needed. Information abilities deplete Chalk from the Potential line.

Chalk is passively accumulated by Striders by simply being. The rate is controlled by a number of factors;
	1. Active or passive accumulation. Striders can focus and draw Chalk to them when large amounts are needed quickly.
	2. Availability. Regions saturated with Latent Chalk increase the rate of passive accumulation.
	3. Interferences. Factors can impair or catalyze absorption, such as the presence of other Striders, active rituals, a Tek or a relic etc.

Accumulating Chalk rapidly can saturate a Strider beyond their capacity to hold Chalk. As unharnessed Chalk is functionally random information, over-accumulation can lead to mental overload, filling the mind with 'noise'. This is usually dealt with by 'flaring'; subjecting unharnessed Chalk to equations that result in the production of heat, and emitting it off the body. But it is not mandatory it be heat alone.

### The Stride
Striding is flaring Chalk in the form of vectors that produce velocity. A Strider gathers latent chalk from the environs until they are saturated with pure potential, subjects it to a unique 'stride equation' that produces and stores momentum, before releasing it as immense velocity. ^5257eb

It helps to think of Striders as compressed springs or a fueled rocket. Once the compression is released or the fuel ignited, immense motion begins that decays gradually over time. This is the nature of Striding. A Strider moves somewhere between 0.9 and 0.99 times the speed of light. This is called the '**Stride Velocity**'.

The distance a Strider can cover is thus proportional to how much latent chalk they can accumulate.

Midflight, a Strider is unable to accumulate chalk, and so all the momentum they produce at the initial launch is all they have to work with. As the Strider crosses distance, it's momentum reduces due to the density of inter-regional space (the Switchboard Sky) and the interspatial void.

### Launch Threshold
A Strider needs a certain amount of accumulated Chalk to exceed the information mass of their own person to commence Striding. In addition to themselves, they must also accumulate enough chalk to move anything else carried with them. Accumulated Information must exceed the 'information mass' for Striding to take place.

This is particularly the reason why despite the power of Striding, vehicles such as starships exist, ferrying people and goods between regions. The information mass of an object increases rapidly when it contains equations, ritual components, is a relic (anything that makes it information dense) that can make carrying it via the Strider Protocol nearly impossible. Attempting to accumulate enough chalk to Stride with such objects in hand can 'fry' the brains of the Strider.

### 'Bubble-skating'
When Striding through inter-regional space, a Strider is unable to change direction mid-flight. Much like a rocket, a Strider upon launch travels in a straight line until they encounter something that alters their trajectory. However (as described in [[The Skywards Pursuit]]) a straight line is often not the safest way or even a way at all to travel from region to region.

To work around this, Striders use 'bubble-skating'. Striders can 'hop' from region to region by allowing themselves to be caught in the gravity caused by the information mass of a region, 'skating' over the boundary that contains that region, making a partial revolution, converting linear to angular momentum, and then back to linear momentum to 'sling-shot' around the region, launching in a new direction.

Repeated multiple times, a Strider can weave between dense pockets of void or regions they'd rather not make contact with, eventually reaching their destination.

	This maneuver is based on an actual technique used by spacecraft, known as a 'gravity assist' or gravity slingshot. Further information can be gleaned by studying these topics.

### Distance Constraints
The Strider Protocol typically cannot be used to travel short distances, such as moving within a region. Primarily, this is because of the launch threshold; the momentum required to overcome the information weight of a Strider is simultaneously enough to accelerate the Strider to a considerable fraction of light speed. Decelerating from light speed is difficult, and is usually only feasible by having the velocity greatly reduced by extended travel and momentum lost to bubble-skating and traversing pockets of void. ^ee7e6f

Moving within regions is usually done through conventional means; land vehicles and personal NLS ships. 

### Arrival Maneuvers
Additionally, aiming the Stride to land at an exact spot is particularly difficult as well as dangerous. Upon reaching a region, Striders may circle around it (orbiting it similar to a satellite) to burn further momentum before attempting entry, though this maneuver is typically used by amateur Striders alone. Skilled Striders simply drop to a sufficiently unoccupied space, convert their remaining momentum to heat, and flare it

Aiming the descent is done similarly to a space shuttle arriving from extraplanetary travel, in that it must touch the outer boundaries of the region a certain distance away horizontal from the desired landing location, and begin a controlled descent downwards and at an angle to eventually make contact with the ground.

Some Striders choose to begin flaring their excess momentum once they enter a region and gravity takes hold, converting it to heat and light - usually for theatrics. Striders that aim to make their arrival known typically do this, leaving a light show in their wake while landing gracefully at their destination.

### Initiate Fly
It is believed the Strider Protocol is the first ritual ever conceived, and as such, operates under ritual mechanics. One of these is the 'Initiate Fly' gesture.

It is a move granted purpose and function by repetition. By performing an otherwise meaningless gesture, the information of a Strider (mind and body) align themselves to prepare to Stride. Much like turning the keys to a car, the initiate fly sets in motion internal changes that brace the Strider for usage of the Strider Protocol.

The gesture can be nearly anything; snapping fingers, clasping the hands, tying shoelaces, rotating a bracelet around the wrist. Any gesture a Strider chooses to grant significance can be their initiation gesture.

It is similarly used by Striders preceding combat, configuring themselves to do battle.
