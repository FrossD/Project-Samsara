# The Hands as Chalk
The entirety of the Switchboard runs on the dynamics and interplay of information in tangible form, known as 'Chalk'. The Hands as Chalk foundational pillar seeks to describe Chalk and how Striders interact with it, how it interacts with the wider Switchboard, and the products of the interplay with all three.

## Tangible Information - Chalk
As described under Information Tangibility, information constitutes a tangible component of all things in the Switchboard. *All* things in the Switchboard *are* information; they and their properties are information as well. As such, all things in the Switchboard exist as configurations - patterns - of unordered information. We call this 'Chalk'.

Chalk is information in physical form, taking on the appearance of jagged, translucent yet mildly cloudy crystals, diffracting pure light into rainbow spectra when passing through it. Reduced to powdered form, it appears similar to cloudy, powdered glass. When in use, Chalk typically takes the form of 'ribbons'; gossamer streaks of chalk, moving seemingly weightlessly, suspended by invisible strings. Chalk also comes in 'ray' or 'radiance' form, emitted by [[The Skywards Pursuit#The Grand Stellar Procession |Law Stars]], in the Switchboard Sky. When these rays are slowed or strike an obstacle, they deposit as chalk in dust/powder form.

Chalk as it exists normally is random information. When arranged or 'patterned', it takes the shape of more conventional objects, such as things as people, as well as properties such as color, taste, etc. From the infinite randomness, all things can be sequenced and created, the mechanics of doing so described further on.

### Pattern and 'Ribbon' Duality
Because all things in the Switchboard are made of patterned chalk, it helps to view objects (such as a piece of fruit) as an origami of chalk 'paper'. When folded, it takes the form the name compels us to reasonably expect. However, when unfolded, a formerly three-dimensional object now becomes flat - chalk ribbons. These chalk ribbons still contain the information of the former three-dimensional object, needing only instructions on 'folding' to be supplied to restore them to their original form. This is the Pattern-Ribbon Duality.

A shirt can be reduced to a chalk ribbon containing all the information of that shirt. Same thing for a house plant, or a slice of bread, or a jet engine or skyscraper. Simple things like a pencil, complex constructs such as a silicon board - **all can be reduced to their ribbon form, and interacted with in their ribbon form, which is the state at which most chalk interactions take place - down at the ribbon level**. This allows us to neatly move into how chalk is interacted with. ^c91b12

## The Weave Protocol
Chalk achieves a state of 'stability' in crystalline form, dense amounts of it forming deposits in the Wellsprings. In dust form, chalk traverses the great Sky of the Switchboard, moving between Law Stars and Wellsprings, regions, super-regions, vaults, and regions of curvature and low depth, falling into the Void. Most meaningful interaction between chalk, however, happens in ribbon form, and interaction with ribbon Chalk by Striders is an innate, essential ability for operating in the Switchboard. This is called the Weave Protocol.

### The Five-Strait
The primary ability granted by the Weave Protocol is 'drawing'. Similar to the Strider Protocol, Information Affinity allows drawing latent chalk to the self, and storing it within the Strider's body, turning them into a reservoir of unharnessed potential. Striding is performed by 'flaring' this chalk to produce velocity, but with the Weave Protocol, Striders can instead - using their fingers - 'draw' ribbons of chalk on surfaces.

With this we then move into the Five-Strait system. To meaningfully interact with the wider world of the Switchboard, Striders must create a series of chalk 'lines', all with a specific purpose. These lines - ribbons - 'communicate' with the lines between them and the 'ribbons' of other objects and phenomena in the outside world.

The first strait created is the ***'potential line'***. This strait is pure, unharnessed chalk, and manifests within Striders, growing in 'mass' as Striders accumulate latent chalk passively or actively. It contains - literally - untapped potential, in the form of chalk not assigned to any exact purpose. 

Following it is the ***'interpreter line'***. The purpose of this line, mainly, is to convert some of the esoteric and convoluted bits of information amassed by accumulating chalk into readable form. Chalk that is moved from the potential line just before comes here to be studied. Teks, instructions for rituals, bits and pieces of information that aren't truly random get detected and sorted here, moving to later lines as necessary. 

The ***'memory line'*** stands in the middle of the Five Straits. Striders being beings of pure chalk lack a centralized memory organ such as a brain. This is elaborated upon more fully in [[The Blank-Slate Mind]]. Summarized, memory in Striders is the memory line, an immensely dense ribbon of chalk that contains everything a Strider knows. Everything. Useful information acquired from the interpreter line comes here to be stored, as well as information created and used in the next line, and *acquired* from the line after *that*. This is also where known Equations are stored, a particularly relevant fact to the final purpose of the Five Strait system.

The ***'computational line'*** is the seat of Strider 'thinking'. Here, chalk is processed and calculated using equations and thinking methodologies to reach an outcome. A Strider can have more than one computational line, and each computational line can be seen as a thread of a multicore processor, all able to work independent of the others, while at the same time working on the same task. The processing speed done by the computational lines is dependent on the Strider's own mental proficiency, and the ability to form additional computational lines relies on the Strider's capacity for parallel processing.

Certain passive computational lines exist that govern more latent processes (bodily and metabolic ones for example) and forming additional, active computational lines can draw too heavily from the 'available pool' of the Strider's mental ability. A Strider aiming to focus all mental power on a task can quite literally forget to breathe. 

The final line in the Five Straits is the ***'interface line'***. This chalk line functions much like the semi-permeable membrane of a cell, the sensors on a complicated robot, or the input devices on a computer. This line interacts with the ribbons of the outside chalk world and wider Switchboard, taking in information, and outputting change.

### How the Five-Strait Works
Information pulled in from the interface line is sent to the potential line, this being the act of accumulating chalk. If this information isn't pure randomness, that is deduced by the interpreter line, with purely random chalk staying back in the potential line. Non-random chalk - chalk with 'pattern' - is sent to the memory line for storage and computational lines for processing where necessary. Any change made is imparted upon the outside world using the interface line once again.

But the true purpose of the Weave Protocol is the usage of Equations. A Switchboard Equation is - most simply put - a set of instructions for weaving ribbons of chalk, to form patterns. As mentioned above, these equations (or rather knowledge of them) are kept in the Memory Line, and computation using them is done in the Computational Line. The results of these calculations are output by the Interface Line. This is the means by which Strider's interact deeply with the Switchboard.

#### Utilization of the Five-Strait
A Strider can produce fire from wood by drawing five concentric Chalk circles around it; the potential, interpreter, memory, computational and interface. The interface line observes the wood, sending a breakdown of information the Strider feels will be necessary for his next steps. The computational line takes numbers from the interpreter and a equation from the memory, specifically one that finds how many joules of energy must be supplied to the wood to produce a certain change in temperature. This number is acquired and sent to the interface line, which draws the energy by folding latent chalk, and supplies it to the wood, inducing heat, and creating fire.

Taken further, a Strider can create a simple camera by drawing a series of concentric circles around the rim of a cup and pointing it at something to be photographed. The interface line is instructed to begin measuring the hexadecimal color values of everything in an arc in front of it, sending these values to a series of computational lines, that stitch the hexadecimal values one after the other in small squares, creating pixels. Adjustments can be made by other computational lines, such as formula that produces a greyscale filter. The resulting series of pixels is sent to the memory line to be stored. It can be output by drawing all five lines in a rectangle, the image being projected in the space created.

### Weave Mechanics
Interacting with chalk occasionally demands Striders to utilize the power to Weave in more intricate ways. These are the 'Weave Mechanics'.

The most common Weave Mechanic learned by Striders is **Point Propagation**. Typically, chalk straits are drawn by physical movement of fingers or a hand across a surface, which necessarily requires that the spaces being interacted with are reachable by hands. With Point Propagation, A Strider can place a finger, multiple fingers or a full hand on a surface, and send out streams of chalk in any direction they choose, allowing reaching locations hands cannot; inside minuscule environments such as machine circuitry, at immense heights, or in conceptual spaces such as minds.

**Ritual Geometry** is a concept that dictates the way certain equations require a subject of that equation to be 'bound' in chalk straits for that equation to function. For example, to start a fire using the Five Straits, you may have to draw a singular, two dimensional circle around the source of fuel. To lockpick a safe using chalk, however, you may have to draw lines all over the the safe that intersect, 'wrapping' it. The Ritual Geometry used is reliant on the parameters of the equation. Encasements of chalk lines are called 'Chalk Boundaries' ^a4757c

Necessarily, some equations may mandate chalk wrapping around the subject, but also that those lines dynamically shift as the equation works upon the subject. In the case of the safe for example, the lines may need to shift into new configurations as the dial is turned one way or the other. Propagating new lines and withdrawing old ones may not allow the equation to work as intended.

The solution to this is **Chalk Within Chalk**. When Five-Strait chalk lines are propagated parallel to each other, additional chalk lines are deployed, perpendicular to the initial. It helps to imagine it as scale of sheet music. These perpendicular 'brace' chalk lines 'hold' the parallel Five-Strait lines, and interface with the Computational Lines. When necessary, the 'brace' lines receive instruction from the Computational Line to move the entire construct of chalk straits, done as the equation demands. 

Control of the CWC brace lines is **Linear Dynamism**, the action of feeding the CWC brace lines with instructions on when a Strider needs the strait lines to assemble, disassemble and reassemble in intricate shapes, move in certain paths and patterns, all to facilitate fulfillment of the equations being used, or the will of the Strider. This is particularly relevant when we get to actual Rituals used by Striders. Linear Dynamism also allows CWC lines to detach the straits from surfaces themselves, granting the Strider the power to draw and form chalk boundaries in air.

### Weavesight
Tapping into the Weave Protocol grants weavers a litany of powers in the form of manipulating chalk ribbon and using the Five Straits. A somewhat more subtle power they are provided with however, is a special manner of 'sight' that is tuned specifically for use in the Switchboard and the calcic world. This is the '**Weavesight**', and with it, Striders can obtain information around the wider calcic world through 'casting their perception'.

**Mechanism**
The Weavesight functions almost in opposition to the power to 'draw' chalk to oneself granted by Strider's and Weavers innate information affinity. In the Weavesight, a subject projects outwards 'rays' of chalk that strike all objects or patterns in their vicinity. By observing the 'outline' formed by these rays of chalk being intercepted by the patterns they strike, the subject obtains firstly a 'wireframe' construction of their immediate environment. This power is reliant on the Five Straits, as chalk that is fed back to the subject as the rays return from where they strike enter the potential line, and are passed to the interpreter line for useful information gleaned to be extracted and passed to the memory line.

>As a note, despite being a manner of 'sight', Weavesight is not reliant on the physical eyes of the subject, and instead, calcic perception-rays can be fired from any part of the body. This is often employed when assessing a subject held in the hands for example.

Naturally, Striders who grow more proficient in using the Weavesight are able to employ perception-rays that penetrate deep into struck targets, allowing the subject to glean incremental amounts of useful information the deeper the rays penetrate. Deeper Weavesight allows for ascertaining the nature of the weaves within a pattern, the nature of the equation that might have been used to fold it, how easy or difficult it would be to unfold and extract weave from. Even more information can be gleaned by subjects who know how to 'focus' their Weavesight, such as narrowing down a large sphere of observation into a singular, laser-like cone of deeply penetrating chalk rays. Focused Weavesight like this, however, is tantamount to blasting a subject with chalk, and occasionally this may not be something the caster may desire.

Functionally, it's a 'scanner' power that is essential for those traversing the Switchboard. It possesses additional utility in combat, in allowing detection of weak points or assessing threats, and utility in calcic casting too in observation of enemy casts as well as your own. Cultivating strong Weavesight is mandatory for Striders who wish to last long in the Switchboard.

>It is common practice for chromegrafted Striders to have their memory lines interface with their Slates, so that information gleaned from Weavesight is passed instantly to their mobile computers and stored into, or cross-referenced against available databases, allowing gleaning even more information, and indexing new discoveries for the usage of others. 

Because Weavesight is a calcic ability, it is subject to rules that other calcic abilities are subject too as well. It expends chalk in its casting, and if chalk casting is being suppressed, Weavesight will feed the user inaccurate data or fail altogether. Less developed forms of Weavesight can also be tricked, through clever usage of weaves meant to disguise the true nature of something. It is also possible to detect when a Strider or Weaver is in the vicinity as Weavesight results in passive emittance of chalk by subjects using it. This can be used to rig traps for example, designed to go off only when Striders or Weavers are present. Particularly skilled and malicious actors are able to encoded weave in a subject that when analyzed by the Weavesight and passed to the interpreter lines, can result in malicious weave spontaneously forming in the interpreter line, and harming the caster of the sight. This is particularly useful for creating environments where Weavesight usage is curtailed.

## Latent Chalk
Both the Strider Protocol and the Weave Protocol function by expending chalk to perform actions, chalk that is accumulated actively or passively via [[The Strider Protocol#^6075ff |Information Affinity]]. Chalk exists in 'clouds' of it in dust form in the general environment, and though the concentration can be low, it is present. This is 'Latent Chalk'. Striders draw from it extensively when using their powers.

	This section delves into world mechanics heavily reliant on concepts outlined in The Skywards Pursuit.

Latent Chalk tends to accumulate in already fairly information-dense regions, drawn towards them like water moving from a high point to a lower one. Latent Chalk often accumulates into crystalline form, become crystal chalk, depositing itself and often growing to colossal proportions. We see this often in the [[The Skywards Pursuit#The Wellsprings |Wellsprings]], regions of immense information density fed directly by Law Stars. 

### Spontaneous Equations
Equations - despite being instructions for folding chalk - are chalk themselves. Occasionally and by pure chance, Latent Chalk arranges itself in just the right ways for an equation to begin to form. Chalk equations are fairly self-correcting, and these Spontaneous Equations grow in complexity and viability over the course of many iterations, eventually becoming an equation capable of producing major observable outcomes.

A major example of this are Regional Equations. Most Regional Equations that dictate the nature of the Switchboard's regions arise naturally in the Wellsprings, growing, evolving and improving over time, until reaching a state at which they begin to fold chalk to produce proto-planetary structures and qualities; quantities of dirt and rock to form landmass, water for oceans, an atmosphere and - most importantly - a gravitational field. At this point the equation and proto-region is ejected into the wider Switchboard. ^b5a598

Despite the separation of distance, regional equations contain a 'clause' within their makeup that links them to the Wellspring that seeds them. They are linked by supporting 'chains', much like the load-bearing steel cord on a suspension bridge, and these chains link the region, the Wellspring that birthed it, and other regions and structures in the vicinity in three dimensional space, allowing all to hinge and provide support to each other. These chains collectively form the '*anchorage superstructures*'. Loss of these support structures results in the regional equation coming undone, leading to regional collapse.  ^10330c

### The Micro-Spontaneous
Curiously, certain entities in the Switchboard may induce the creation of [[The Lattice as a Canvas#Emergent Minds|Emergent Minds]], elementary calcic intelligences that arise through the folding of chalk under rigorous self-correction mechanism and selection. They cannot live very long without vessels however. Coincidentally, what often causes these Emergent Minds to emerge is the presence of objects and oddities with specific kinds of very dense pattern, the kind that forms primarily in objects that are very old and/or have seen use in the hands of Striders. These objects are usually denoted as [[The Relics of New|Relics]]. Emergent intelligences that arise around them usually emerge with singular prime directive, a doctrine; protect what it is that brought them to be. This is accomplished by the construction of a Vault, which serves as both protection for what caused the intelligence to arise, as well as a body for the intelligence itself. Often, the first few 'building blocks' of the Vault spontaneously evolve as well, granting the emerging intelligence a baseplate upon which to build. This is further elaborated upon in [[The Skywards Pursuit]]. ^33b0d3

Happening on a much smaller scale, a spontaneous equation can evolve using some object or concept as a 'seed', which dictates the outcome. Around objects, the results are Relics, items granted additional power from equations encased within them. Objects already containing considerable amounts of information act as sinks, more information pooling into them, subsequently resulting in spontaneous equations. This is further elaborated upon in [[The Relics of New#^a3de16 |The Relics of New]].  ^abc506

Teks are another product of the micro-spontaneous equations. These are powerful equations that grant Striders powers, taking the form of chalk ribbon, often encased in chalk crystal, or in transit across the Switchboard on chalk currents. Finding one of such Teks is no mean feat. A vast majority of Teks wielded by Striders are seeded by scraps of patterned chalk moving across the Switchboard Sky; ideas from Striders themselves, bits from other concepts lost in the Switchboard, etc. More on Teks can be found in [[The Blank-Slate Mind]].
