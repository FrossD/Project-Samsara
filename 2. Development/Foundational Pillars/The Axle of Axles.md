# The Axle of Axles
*"Ask not for a lighter load, but broader shoulders."*

This doc seeks to unite a litany of Switchboard/Samsara concepts;
- [[The Blank-Slate Mind]]
- [[The Bayesian SlateMind]]
- Information Tangibility
- [[The Mysticism]]
- [[The Lattice as a Canvas]] & [[LatCanvasHex]], though to a somewhat lesser extent.

From the intersection of these concepts will something emerge; the **Zenith Axle**, the Axle of Axles, on which all things in the Samsara canon will hinge. 

## Pivotal Concepts
New concepts and old concepts redefined as we work towards the realization of the Axle of Axles.

### The Bayesian Slate-Mind 
The power system; Striders gain and show their power by efficient usage of information, and this is done via perceiving accurate correlations, and using these correlations to draw conclusions that are as reflective of reality as possible.

### Information Tangibility
The idea that these correlations can be manipulated once understood - in the form of chalk. All things are chalk, and can be unfolded and refolded if the correlation between folded and unfolded/the right equation to fold and unfold - are known.

### Fractal Infometry
The 'whole' and the 'part' exist in a dualism of equality. From one page of a book can we get all of it, using **Bayesianity** to perceive the correlation between page and book, and **InfoTang** to perform the actual reconstruction of book from page.

### The Core
As discussed by Hexagonelle is an alternative way of putting an amorphously defined, but preexisting concept - that of Strider's existing primarily alongside guiding doctrines, and Strider conflicts being a clash of one doctrine against another. This loops well into concepts such as the Theory of Damage, where damage to the Strider is sustained by the lattice, and further allows for the existence of doctrinal/philosophical weapons, used rarely but to immense effect in the Switchboard.

### Information Quality vs Quantity
In the making of SlateMind we sought to develop the means by which one Strider might be stronger than another. We came up with a first draft; that simply having information made you stronger, and having information that answered questions that people sought answers too made you stronger still. We then ran into an issue in which we then had to explain why a Strider couldn't just generate infinite strings of alphanumerical data - which are indeed information - and by simply *having* that information, vastly exceed all other Striders in strength.

To solve this issue, we split the 'power' provided by the interaction between information *quantity* and information *quality*. We called the quantity of information what it is, **Knowledge**, and the quality of information what it *causes*, **Power**. Knowledge is hence, *not*, power in the Switchboard.

Knowledge is fairly simple; it is accumulated by merely being, sensing and thinking. Power is a bit more complex; the 'quality' of the Knowledge held by a Strider is dependent on what questions can be answered using that knowledge. In the question of "What is the composition of quartz?", knowing the composition of iron is not particularly powerful, the reason why being the knowledge *had* and the answer *sought* are not *well correlated*. 

### Correlation & Bayesianity
So how do we get power out of our knowledge of the composition of iron? We must take a tangent to look at the world and understand that it is - for the most part - perceptible and as a result, interactable with. All things that exist in any sense where that word is usable are perceptible and interactable with in some manner and too some degree, and in the rare instance they are not, their effects on *other* things can be perceived and interacted with. Think how we can't see gravity but it's effects are very clear on things that we *can* see. 

From this we can make a conclusion; nothing in the universe has *zero correlation* with any other and arguably *every other* thing in the universe. It is always possible to construct a chain of correlations between any one thing and any other thing in the universe, and this chain allows us to use what we know about the thing at the start of the chain to obtain answers about what sits at the end of it. Any knowledge about any thing has *non-zero* correlation with any truth about any other thing. It can be lower than other fistfuls of knowledge, but **never zero.**

By principle, all things are correlated - in varying degrees - to all other things.

	The deployment of this principle in - quite literally - its final form, is the Mysticism.

The power then of the Bayesian SlateMind - and the power of a Strider as a derivative of that - is the ability to make use of these correlations. To perceive the link between information and question - that correlation - requires an unbiased Blank-Slate Mind and efficiency in execution. The efficiency of using information (and correlations) to make predictions - answer questions - is 'Bayesianity'. 

A mind is an engine that burns fuel, how 'good' that fuel is being dependent on how well the information (which is the fuel) correlates with the question. But just as important as the information-fuel is the aforementioned mind-engine. 

The degree to which a mind can make use of correlations is the mind's Bayesianity. Perceiving correlations *where there are none*, subsequently, produces *negative* power, which is of great detriment to Striders. Certainty about something - then - is irrelevant if the means used to reach it are faulty.

	A bit lost here; 'correlations where there are none' but also 'everything has non-zero correlation with everything else'? Ask Hex to clarify.

	NOTE: Hex actually clarifies this later in the doc, using 'strong' and 'weak' correlations. Strong, weak, but never none. Splendid.

To restate, Bayesianity is seeing patterns only when they are actually present, and only when a correlation exists.

	This 'seeing patterns' is where the Teks aspect of SlateMind comes in. 

We can then talk about scaling Bayesian mind-engines; using our example on the composition of a piece of quartz, we can begin with a poor, faulty, barely Bayesian at all engine that erroneously correlates the *had* knowledge of - say - the composition of a piece of calcite, and concludes that that it is quartz. The fact that this example barely even follows to you, the reader, shows how lacking in Bayesianity - and thus, any sense whatsoever.

An engine a few notches above could make the distinction between various materials when seeking to answer the question of 'what is the composition of quartz?'. Given an ensemble of granite, plastic, wool, iron and wood, they can make use of their knowledge about these materials to deduce which would be the most useful in answering the question that is the composition of quartz.

A mind-engine in it's final form is one that can make use of even the slightest correlation to answer questions. Any knowledge had - in the hands of a master Bayesian thinker - *could* have relevance to *any* question at hand, so long as this thinker is willing to plumb the very depths for the dots, and connect the lines between them, no matter how short or inelastic the cord. In the question of the composition of quartz when that of iron is known, the master Bayesian goes down to the fundamental; both iron and quartz are made up of elementary particles - protons, neutrons and electrons - and observing that the behavior of these particles is not unique to iron, but rather exists in both the iron and the quartz. With this connection made, it is possible to deduce the composition of quartz.

### Doctrinal Powers
The purity of the mind engine and its Bayesianity as an extension of that is reflected in the Strider's personhood - more specifically, their **Doctrinal Core**. The doctrinal core is at the heart of a Strider's lattice, and it is the *efficiency with which that doctrine was formed* that determines the strength of the doctrine, the doctrinal core within a Strider, and hence, the strength of a Strider themselves.

At its simplest, the doctrinal core can be viewed as a numerical multiplier to a Strider's various powers. Well-formed doctrine quite literally translates to harder fists, faster kicks and more durable blocks, as well as buffing the strength of calcic powers such as teks and relics. To reiterate, the doctrine itself isn't a source of strength - at most, it guides a Strider's actions, the strength comes from the level of efficiency - Bayesianity - with which the doctrine is concluded upon. 

There is risk inherent in this however, in that the doctrinal core is vulnerable to influence by ideology, philosophy and bias - conclusions that may not have been  reached using Bayesian principles. This can weaken the overall Bayesianity of the core, and thus, weaken the Strider. 

	Disconnect between what is believed and the resultant of that belief can be a source of considerable turmoil; and could prove very useful for narrative.

Additionally, more Bayesian Striders find themselves able to extract additional value from the information (knowledge) they obtain, as they are able to perceive additional links - connections and correlations - within it. They are more prone to being changed by the knowledge they obtain and the correlations they make using it. The more efficient the mind, the more useful correlations become, and the weightier they become on their perceiver.  

### Learning, Knowing and Thinking
As adapted from [[The Blank-Slate Mind]];

	Salvaging operation; some principles under this are still intact, while others have been changed.

For one, the mental actions of 'learning', 'thinking' and 'knowing' are not carried out by Striders in a centralized node as it is with us - in our brain. Striders instead perform these actions using the Five Strait lines within their lattices; specifically the **memory**, **interface** and **computational** lines. Hence, LTK (learning, thinking, knowing) functions are carried out using the Strider's entire person. 

To add more detail, 'knowing' is the storage of information, and is thusly a product of the memory line. 'Learning' makes use of the interface lines, as learning is intake of information from the wider environment. 'Thinking' takes root in the computational line. 

**Knowledge (and Power)**
The first iteration of SB 'knowledge' revolved around having knowledge being the source of a Strider's power and the difference in knowledge between Striders resulted in the difference in power. It also worked using the old iteration of information tangibility; that things were like file cabinets and the qualities and 'features' of those things were like files in that cabinet in which the presence of files affecting the cabinet itself. The issues with this system were many, the details of which can be recalled with effort, but aren't of immense importance in the moment.

The new model of Knowledge-Power interplay in the Switchboard (which we can call KPI) is defined by power being a product of the questions that can be answered by a given piece of knowledge. We can then use this model to address what the old model tried to do, but taken from a newer and superior angle - power being a product of having secrets. 

	Ironically - and something I've noticed as I continue to work through Samsara - is that I have developed principles and concepts that already exist often from scratch. Under the Power Through 'Knowing' heading in 'The Blank-Slate Mind', what is described is a hypothetical in which knowing a thing allowed for making educated, better, guesses - the very core of Bayesianity. It aimed to describe how KNOWING more allowed for DOING more, and doing better.

The major takeaway is that there must be a minor differentiation between 'knowledge' and 'secrets', defined by a certain threshold of the desirability of a piece of knowledge as well as the difficulty of obtaining it - that allows it to become a secret.

Put more simply, suppose I had a box with three colored balls in it; red, yellow and blue. The color of the balls is knowledge that can be obtained, and the power obtained from that knowledge, under KPI, scales with how many questions that knowledge can answer. However, where knowledge becomes a 'secret' is when **enough unique inquirers are asking the same question**.

You could imagine a number tied to any piece of knowledge which represents 'curiosity about it', and then imagine that a certain formula converts that curiosity to power. Questions are asked - and so only exist when asked - by things that think, and so questions don't necessarily exist as amorphous holes that exist in space and time that certain bits of knowledge are able to fill. The necessity of this is that if questions existed in the same way sand on the ground did, then infinite questions could exist, all of which could be answered by bits of knowledge - the result of this being that any question that can possibly be conceived exists, and so every bit of knowledge will produce an infinite amount of power. This, obviously, breaks the system.

As such, the KPI is dependent on the very people subject to it. For me to derive power from my knowledge, it must answer questions, but these questions need to be asked by other Striders for them to exist. The fundamental difference between knowledge and a secret is that a secret is knowledge about which an arbitrary threshold of inquiry has been crossed.

	Narratively, a secret is often a reward for endeavors in the Switchboard, particularly when clearing vaults.

**Power (from Knowledge)**
So what actual power is derived from 'powerful' knowledge? Ironically, it is far simpler than the actual KPI mechanism. At its simplest, possessing powerful knowledge provides what can be described as an arbitrary numerical multiplier to a Strider's abilities. Striders with useful knowledge quite literally can hit harder, move faster, and take more damage than those with less.

Regarding calcic powers, it's also similar; possessing this useful knowledge increases the efficacy of a Strider's teks, relics, rituals and weaving abilities in what ever way these can be made more effective; rituals cost lest and are more effective upon cast, relic weapons can be lighter to wield, heavier on hit, more durable and dangerous, and teks similarly see improvements in general utility and lethality where applicable. 

	Narratively, it allows for certain assumptions and justifications to be made about the relative strength of one Strider versus another. Older Striders tend to be more powerful by virtue of simply having been exposed to more - and thus, have learned - more knowledge. Experienced Striders - Striders frequently braving new frontiers and the like - are also justifiably more powerful as their pursuits yield fruit and this serves to increase their power.

Of course, there is also power granted by the actual contents of the knowledge itself, such as knowing the location of something lost, or the schema of a ritual to achieve some aim many have need of.

	Perhaps the final analogy to describe KPI interpaly is that knowledge of the code for a safe gives both access to the valuables inside as well as the physical strength to carry them. 

**The Dilemma of 'Mass Knowing'**
Under the old system, a clause existed such that the power granted by knowledge of a thing also scaled with how many people knew that thing. For example, the power I gain from the knowledge of colors in a box reduces if I were to share that knowledge with someone else.

This clause was intended to drive narrative. For one, a very powerful Strider would be one who knows things known by no one else - a keeper of secrets, as it were - and as such allowed narrative 'drivers' to naturally emerge from them; 

- What do they know? 
- Where did they get the knowledge? 
- What can they do because they have it?
- Is anyone trying to take that knowledge from them?
- Are they trying to prevent that?
- What lengths are they going to prevent that, if they are?

Is there any reason for this to carry over to the new system? For one, there is mechanical reason for this clause to exist; if curiosity about knowledge is converted to power obtained when that knowledge is known, it follows then that a decline in curiosity - caused by people having answers to their questions - would result in a decline in the power provided by the knowledge that satisfies that curiosity. 

	My personal stance is that the clause should continue to exist in the new system. The narrative potential surrounding knowledge as a currency in which hoarding is incentivized is too great to lose. 

### Strider Evolution

	I will need the good doctor to comment further on this.

At first glance, I feel Strider Evolution is already all that it needs to be. Initially it exists a means to justify the existence of the Mysticism, and outside of it, it doesn't have any real defined use other than as an axle for something in the future to hinge upon. 

It can however be restated with new language, as done in [[The Mysticism]] under [[The Mysticism#Thinking 2.0 |Thinking 2.0]]; 'thinking' in Striders is a product of the computational line, and the computational line itself is made of chalk, and is hence subject to the same principles chalk is. And so while the computational line is what directs equations to fold chalk, the computational line itself can be subject to an equation that causes it to unfold and refold in a manner that allows new kinds of thinking, and the powers that result from it. This is the means by which Striders 'evolve', and was the cause of the Mysticism. 

What I feel is the next issue to contend with it what prompts the computational line to fold. The old SlateMind doc described it as 'applying new thinking methodologies' - a phrase devoid of meaning, almost. It basically states that the ability to think in new ways can be achieved by... thinking in new ways. The Mysticism does better; refolding the computational line takes 'massive evolutionary jumps' or 'epiphanies'; something external that causes cascading monumental change. 

Where we might see an opportunity for this concept to take root is in the Core; the seat of the Strider's being - the centralized placement of their doctrine. Doctrine guides and drives Striders, and so it follows that a change to doctrine results in a radical change to the Strider that grows from it. It still leaves us with further questions; does the change in doctrine alone facilitate the folding of the computational line, or must some new doctrine be adopted for the folding to take place? Can damage to the Core drive the change? These questions are narrative ones.
