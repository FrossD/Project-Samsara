# The Blank-Slate Mind
Striders do not think with brains. Instead, the seat of cognition and consciousness is decentralized - undertaken instead by the Strider's entire person. The lattice of the Strider - their entire self - is a singular engine that grows powerful through adherence to the principles of spotting correlations and patterns, answering questions and Bayesianity. 

## The Doctrinal Core
At the center of a Strider sits the doctrinal core. At the center of the Switchboard lies doctrine. Doctrine guides a Strider. It is the basis of all of their power and principle. The purity of doctrine ultimately decides the differences between Striders across a litany of spheres, but ultimately, all Strider interactions are an interaction between doctrines. Particularly in combat, doctrine is pitted against doctrine in their capacity to overcome one another, and prove - for the most part - what doctrine is greater. 

Doctrines in the Switchboard are old and many. A Strider may hold on to their family's doctrine, and choose to pursue the perfect Semblance as the Fel-Arcad do, or to traverse the Great Sky as the Sil'khan. Doctrine can be borrowed from organizations, such as the Spyndl Academy, who's Operators fight, explore and learn. Striders may choose to embrace the doctrine of the Current, and live well simply so that what they return to the great stream of chalk may inspire and bestow boons upon the next generation. Some create their own doctrine, and others follow it for hundreds of processions. Some choose to forgo all others; that too is doctrine. Doctrine is an inevitability. 

## Doctrinal Powers
> It is highly recommended you read [[The Grand Mechanica]] before perusing this section.

The purity of the mind engine and its Bayesianity as an extension of that is reflected in the Strider's personhood - more specifically, their **Doctrinal Core**. The doctrinal core is at the heart of a Strider's lattice, and it is the *efficiency with which that doctrine was formed* that determines the strength of the doctrine, the doctrinal core within a Strider, and hence, the strength of a Strider themselves.

At its simplest, the doctrinal core can be viewed as a numerical multiplier to a Strider's various powers. Well-formed doctrine quite literally translates to harder fists, faster kicks and more durable blocks, as well as buffing the strength of calcic powers such as teks and relics. To reiterate, the doctrine itself isn't a source of strength - at most, it guides a Strider's actions, the strength comes from the level of efficiency - Bayesianity - with which the doctrine is concluded upon. 

There is risk inherent in this however, in that the doctrinal core is vulnerable to influence by ideology, philosophy and bias - conclusions that may not have been  reached using Bayesian principles. This can weaken the overall Bayesianity of the core, and thus, weaken the Strider. 

	Disconnect between what is believed and the resultant of that belief can be a source of considerable turmoil; and could prove very useful for narrative.

Additionally, more Bayesian Striders find themselves able to extract additional value from the information (knowledge) they obtain, as they are able to perceive additional links - connections and correlations - within it. They are more prone to being changed by the knowledge they obtain and the correlations they make using it. The more efficient the mind, the more useful correlations become, and the weightier they become on their perceiver.  

## Learning, Knowing and Thinking
For one, the mental actions of 'learning', 'thinking' and 'knowing' are not carried out by Striders in a centralized node as it is with us - in our brain. Striders instead perform these actions using the Five Strait lines within their lattices; specifically the **memory**, **interface** and **computational** lines. Hence, LTK (learning, thinking, knowing) functions are carried out using the Strider's entire person. 

>It is recommend you read [[The Hands as Chalk]] before perusing this section.

To add more detail, 'knowing' is the storage of information, and is thusly a product of the memory line. 'Learning' makes use of the interface lines, as learning is intake of information from the wider environment. 'Thinking' takes root in the computational line. 

**Knowledge (and Power)**
The first iteration of SB 'knowledge' revolved around having knowledge being the source of a Strider's power and the difference in knowledge between Striders resulted in the difference in power. It also worked using the old iteration of information tangibility; that things were like file cabinets and the qualities and 'features' of those things were like files in that cabinet in which the presence of files affecting the cabinet itself. The issues with this system were many, the details of which can be recalled with effort, but aren't of immense importance in the moment.

The new model of Knowledge-Power interplay in the Switchboard (which we can call KPI) is defined by power being a product of the questions that can be answered by a given piece of knowledge. We can then use this model to address what the old model tried to do, but taken from a newer and superior angle - power being a product of having secrets. 

The major takeaway is that there must be a minor differentiation between 'knowledge' and 'secrets', defined by a certain threshold of the desirability of a piece of knowledge as well as the difficulty of obtaining it - that allows it to become a secret.

Put more simply, suppose I had a box with three colored balls in it; red, yellow and blue. The color of the balls is knowledge that can be obtained, and the power obtained from that knowledge, under KPI, scales with how many questions that knowledge can answer. However, where knowledge becomes a 'secret' is when **enough unique inquirers are asking the same question**.

You could imagine a number tied to any piece of knowledge which represents 'curiosity about it', and then imagine that a certain formula converts that curiosity to power. Questions are asked - and so only exist when asked - by things that think, and so questions don't necessarily exist as amorphous holes that exist in space and time that certain bits of knowledge are able to fill. The necessity of this is that if questions existed in the same way sand on the ground did, then infinite questions could exist, all of which could be answered by bits of knowledge - the result of this being that any question that can possibly be conceived exists, and so every bit of knowledge will produce an infinite amount of power. This, obviously, breaks the system.

As such, the KPI is dependent on the very people subject to it. For me to derive power from my knowledge, it must answer questions, but these questions need to be asked by other Striders for them to exist. The fundamental difference between knowledge and a secret is that a secret is knowledge about which an arbitrary threshold of inquiry has been crossed.

	Narratively, a secret is often a reward for endeavors in the Switchboard, particularly when clearing vaults.

**Power (from Knowledge)**
So what actual power is derived from 'powerful' knowledge? Ironically, it is far simpler than the actual KPI mechanism. At its simplest, possessing powerful knowledge provides what can be described as an arbitrary numerical multiplier to a Strider's abilities. Striders with useful knowledge quite literally can hit harder, move faster, and take more damage than those with less.

Regarding calcic powers, it's also similar; possessing this useful knowledge increases the efficacy of a Strider's teks, relics, rituals and weaving abilities in what ever way these can be made more effective; rituals cost lest and are more effective upon cast, relic weapons can be lighter to wield, heavier on hit, more durable and dangerous, and teks similarly see improvements in general utility and lethality where applicable. 

	Narratively, it allows for certain assumptions and justifications to be made about the relative strength of one Strider versus another. Older Striders tend to be more powerful by virtue of simply having been exposed to more - and thus, have learned - more knowledge. Experienced Striders - Striders frequently braving new frontiers and the like - are also justifiably more powerful as their pursuits yield fruit and this serves to increase their power.

Of course, there is also power granted by the actual contents of the knowledge itself, such as knowing the location of something lost, or the schema of a ritual to achieve some aim many have need of.

	Perhaps the final analogy to describe KPI interpaly is that knowledge of the code for a safe gives both access to the valuables inside as well as the physical strength to carry them. 

**The Dilemma of 'Mass Knowing'**
Under the old system, a clause existed such that the power granted by knowledge of a thing also scaled with how many people knew that thing. For example, the power I gain from the knowledge of colors in a box reduces if I were to share that knowledge with someone else.

This clause was intended to drive narrative. For one, a very powerful Strider would be one who knows things known by no one else - a keeper of secrets, as it were - and as such allowed narrative 'drivers' to naturally emerge from them; 

- What do they know? 
- Where did they get the knowledge? 
- What can they do because they have it?
- Is anyone trying to take that knowledge from them?
- Are they trying to prevent that?
- What lengths are they going to prevent that, if they are?

There is mechanical reason for this clause to exist; if curiosity about knowledge is converted to power obtained when that knowledge is known, it follows then that a decline in curiosity - caused by people having answers to their questions - would result in a decline in the power provided by the knowledge that satisfies that curiosity. 

## Strider Evolution

	I will need the good doctor to comment further on this.

At first glance, I feel Strider Evolution is already all that it needs to be. Initially it exists a means to justify the existence of the Mysticism, and outside of it, it doesn't have any real defined use other than as an axle for something in the future to hinge upon. 

It can however be restated with new language, as done in [[The Mysticism]] under [[The Mysticism#Thinking 2.0 |Thinking 2.0]]; 'thinking' in Striders is a product of the computational line, and the computational line itself is made of chalk, and is hence subject to the same principles chalk is. And so while the computational line is what directs equations to fold chalk, the computational line itself can be subject to an equation that causes it to unfold and refold in a manner that allows new kinds of thinking, and the powers that result from it. This is the means by which Striders 'evolve', and was the cause of the Mysticism. 

What I feel is the next issue to contend with it what prompts the computational line to fold. The old SlateMind doc described it as 'applying new thinking methodologies' - a phrase devoid of meaning, almost. It basically states that the ability to think in new ways can be achieved by... thinking in new ways. The Mysticism does better; refolding the computational line takes 'massive evolutionary jumps' or 'epiphanies'; something external that causes cascading monumental change. 

Where we might see an opportunity for this concept to take root is in the Core; the seat of the Strider's being - the centralized placement of their doctrine. Doctrine guides and drives Striders, and so it follows that a change to doctrine results in a radical change to the Strider that grows from it. It still leaves us with further questions; does the change in doctrine alone facilitate the folding of the computational line, or must some new doctrine be adopted for the folding to take place? Can damage to the Core drive the change? These questions are narrative ones. 

## Teks
Teks are Chalk Equations that channel Latent Chalk as well as Chalk within a Strider, according to internal parameters, to produce external changes. Dropping the pretense, Teks are functionally the same as magical abilities, though I add (defensively) considerably more thought behind them.

	Teks can be read as 'techniques'.

### The Nature of Teks
Teks being Chalk Equations makes them subject to the same rules that chalk itself is, particularly that of arising spontaneously. Though they can also be artificially created, most Teks form in the crystalline chalk deposits of the Wellsprings, dragged up by currents and beginning a slow wander across the Sky, usually to be captured and encased in crystalline chalk elsewhere.

Teks function using the Five-Straits. As having the ability to use a Tek requires Knowing, Teks are stored in the Memory Line. They draw from the potential line where a Strider either uses internal or Latent Chalk to fuel the Tek, and pass instruction to the interpreter line that interprets the equations of the Tek to the computational line, which combines data supplied from the interface line, and outputs the result of those calculations through the interface line. 

### Categories of Teks
Teks are primarily powers wielded by Striders in combat, though Teks vary widely in what they are able to do. Teks for combat are classified into four categories, with names for the Striders that use them, though it must also be mentioned Teks have use outside purely combat as well;
- **Sequencer Teks**
	- Used by **Strider Sequencers**. Sequencer Teks work by copying ('sequencing') chalk equations and replicating them for use by the Strider. Teks here are fairly elementary, resembling elemental arcane powers such as summoning fire and lightning.
- **Vector Manipulation Teks**
	- Used by **Strider Redirectors**. Grant control over all quantities with magnitude and direction. Elementary Redirectors can typically only modify direction, with more advanced Teks allowing altering magnitude as well. Can turn a light tap on the ground into a teeth-rattling shockwave.
- **Assembly and Disassembly Teks**
	- Used by **Strider Psychitects**. The power to form constructs out of pure chalk and mathematics, as well as disassemble them. More advanced Teks allows for finer control and greater intricacy of what is formed. Elementary forms allows for making barriers or dismantling obstacles, more refined, allows for creating blades or firearms.
- **Modification Teks**
	- Used by **Strider Augmenters**. Much like playing support in a game; enhancing the abilities of others as well as preexisting abilities held by the Strider themselves. Advanced eyesight. Better hearing. Boosted agility and reflexes. Faster and more parallel thinking. Accelerated regeneration.
Additionally;
- **Esoteric Teks**
	- Used by **Strider Esoterics**. These Teks exist outside conventional classification, acting more as wildcards. Some stand alone, while others modify the preexisting categories of Teks. Examples are pure teleportation and mental powers. 

### Teks and Striders
The complex nature of Teks means that though many Teks exist, Striders typically only know one or two, as this constraint is place on them by their Memory Lines. Attempting to learn more has the same effect as accumulating too much chalk when attempting to Stride; overwriting essential information with noise and randomness.

An unintentional side-effect of this is that Striders known for using certain Teks accumulate renown or notoriety, the result of which is elaborated upon with [[The Cyclicality of Names |Strider Ballads]]. Striders with particularly powerful and well-known Teks may knowingly or unknowingly cultivate groups of other Striders that follow them, and by virtue of Strider Evolution, may develop weaker versions of the Tek they posses. It leads to the formation of 'cults' of Striders, all using powers similar to that of their leader's. 

Some Striders choose to accept that Teks function indisputably similarly to fictional arcane powers, and thusly take arcane titles (such as mage, wizard, alchemist, spell-blade) for aesthetic purposes. Under the concept of[[The Cyclicality of Names | Strider Titles]] however, Striders particularly skilled at using their Teks may gain arcane titles and the titular powers associated with them.

### Obtaining Teks
Teks are intricately patterned Chalk that forms equations, which take the shape of wieldable powers used by Striders as tools or as weapons in combat. An essential part of the growth of a Strider to power and prominence is finding and mastering a Tek, which then raises the question of how Teks can be found.

Teks being Chalk equations work under the same principles as Chalk, particularly the ones outlined under '**Spontaneous Equations**' in [[The Hands as Chalk]]. Teks form from Latent Chalk that accumulates and due to a certain amount of internal self-correction, grow, change, and evolve over time into coherent, functional equations. 

	As a random thought, it would make sense logically if the evolution of latent chalk to a Tek would be truly completed through further refinement by Striders. It seems somewhat - if not fairly - absurd that the ability to, for example, form balls of fire is just a 'thing' that 'becomes' even if it takes considerable time and happens in favorable conditions. Narratively, it further works to stress Teks as not just a thing Striders 'do', but in ways, they 'are'. A Strider *is* their Tek because their Tek is most likely unique, and almost synonymous with their name, often being the means by which they are recognized.

Where are Teks formed then? Primarily, in Wellsprings. Law Stars emit pure streams of Chalk endlessly, which accumulate in regions, saturating them with the raw potential of unharnessed chalk. These regions - the Wellsprings - are where Teks form over long periods of time. 

	As an appendum, if all that is needed for Teks to form is latent chalk and time, then it is fair to say they aren't exclusive to the Wellsprings. What truly are the limits to where a Tek can generate? Can there be a regional Tek, created by the proximity of people in the region or the regional equation itself, to a crystalline deposit of chalk?
	
	It seems perfectly rational that Vaults would thave Teks within them as well, placed there by the Minds that created the Vault, slipping into them from riding on chalk currents, or evolving over time in the information-dense environments they present.

How then are Teks found? Teks typically reach near-completion in the same general area the evolution process began, meaning that a vast majority of Teks are hidden or encased in layers and layers of chalk, making them hard to detect. Teks are ordered chalk, but ordered in a manner that doesn't make it easily distinguishable from unordered, random Chalk. 

To answer a complex question simply, finding a Tek is a matter of identifying negentropy; 'negative chaos'. It is finding pi or Avogadro's number or the gravitational constant in a sea of random numbers. Doing so without any aid is nigh impossible, and so tools, tricks and just plain experience create the divide between Striders who can find Teks as though they called out their names, and Striders who never see one in their lifetime. 

To answer a complex question with the equivalent complexity it deserves, imagine travelling across a frozen tundra, sheets of ice as far as the eyes can see. Blizzards strike - seemingly - whenever they choose. Altitude varies, with valleys featuring colder temperatures leading into mountains promising deadly exposure. And then, without explanation, you find a patch of verdant, green grass. Next to it, a larger patch. Next to *that*, an even larger patch, this one with flowers blooming pleasantly within it. You follow these patches until they merge and grow, becoming a large field - and at the center of it - a pool of clear, steaming hot water.

This is a more obvious Tek. It alters the environment around it indisputably, in a manner visible to all who take a casual glance. In homogeneity of the icy wastes, any deviation from the expected is most rationally explained by esoteric factors. It is similar in the Switchboard; a Tek may shape the environment around - sometimes dangerously - and Striders are tasked with locating the abstract 'center' of the deviation, and retrieve the Tek from within.

Some Teks, however, are more complex.

Returning to the frozen tundra, suppose you set up a monitoring facility and observed the tundra for three months (108 days, as a Switchboard 'month' is 36 days). You chart the resulting data and find... oddities. Blizzards hit on the sixth and eighteenth of each month. Snowdrifts grew and shrank by multiples of seventeen. Auroras hit at the start of every month. Polar animals migrated in pack sizes of ascending prime numbers, following zig-zagging paths at alternating angles. It is far too much coincidence, something greater must be at work. 

Noticing these intricacies without conscious measurement will undoubtedly take time, and noticing some (such as Auroras at the start of every month) are somewhat explainable away, prompting no further inquiry. However, a discerning mind will able to observe these occurrences and draw a more apt conclusion; a line of negentropy - 'anti-chaos' - in the cacophony.

Finding Teks is a test of a Strider's ability to find patterns, consistencies, similarities, in deluges of chalk.
