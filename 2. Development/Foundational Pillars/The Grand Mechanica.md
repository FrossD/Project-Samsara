# The Grand Mechanica
Lathe-spun tool-cut brass cogs interlock, spin and whine; each of them a law. The constitution-engine resultant is a parent to many children, and an axle upon which all other concepts and creation hinge. This is the Grand Mechanica of the Switchboard. 

## Information
The core of the Switchboard is that of **information**, which takes on physical form as **chalk**. All things in the Switchboard are chalk, and it is from the mechanics and behavior of chalk do we get all things. Because all things are chalk, there are tangible bridges that span the gaps between any one thing and the other, and understanding of those bridges allows for their manipulation. This concept is **information tangibility**; understanding of chalk allows total manipulation of it. By proxy, understanding of chalk grants the power to alter all that is real.

Through the mechanics outlined in [[The Hands as Chalk]], chalk in the Switchboard is its system of power. Possession of it, utilization of it - using chalk in the Switchboard is how power is exerted. And chalk is information, and so information is power. But there are mechanics to this as well.

## Information Quality vs Quantity
In older iterations of the mechanica we sought to develop the means by which one Strider might be stronger than another. We came up with a first draft; that simply having information made you stronger, and having information that answered questions that people sought answers to made you stronger still. We then ran into an issue in which we then had to explain why a Strider couldn't just generate infinite strings of alphanumerical data - which are indeed information - and by simply *having* that information, vastly exceed all other Striders in strength.

To solve this issue, we split the 'power' provided by the interaction between information *quantity* and information *quality*. We called the quantity of information what it is, **Knowledge**, and the quality of information what it *causes*, **Power**. Knowledge is hence, *not*, power in the Switchboard.

Knowledge is fairly simple; it is accumulated by merely being, sensing and thinking. Power is a bit more complex; the 'quality' of the Knowledge held by a Strider is dependent on what questions can be answered using that knowledge. In the question of "What is the composition of quartz?", knowing the composition of iron is not particularly powerful, the reason why being the knowledge *had* and the answer *sought* are not *well correlated*. These correlations are the bridge between chalk and chalk in the Switchboard, and understanding these correlations grants the power to manipulate them, and through manipulating them is power obtained.

## Correlation & Bayesianity
>We must first address a concept; **Bayesianity**.

>Most simply put, Striders gain and show their power by efficient usage of information, and this is done via perceiving accurate correlations, and using these correlations to draw conclusions that are as reflective of reality as possible. This is a massively simplified explanation of the subject, but enough for our purposes. Striders utilize this concept of Bayesianity using another concept known as [[The Blank-Slate Mind]], or the 'SlateMind' as it is often contracted to.

So how do we get power out of our knowledge of the composition of iron? We must take a tangent to look at the world and understand that it is - for the most part - perceptible and as a result, interactable with. All things that exist in any sense where that word is usable are perceptible and interactable with in some manner and too some degree, and in the rare instance they are not, their effects on *other* things can be perceived and interacted with. Think how we can't see gravity but it's effects are very clear on things that we *can* see. 

From this we can make a conclusion; nothing in the universe has *zero correlation* with any other and arguably *every other* thing in the universe. It is always possible to construct a chain of correlations between any one thing and any other thing in the universe, and this chain allows us to use what we know about the thing at the start of the chain to obtain answers about what sits at the end of it. Any knowledge about any thing has *non-zero* correlation with any truth about any other thing. It can be lower than other fistfuls of knowledge, but **never zero.**

By principle, all things are correlated - in varying degrees - to all other things.

The power then of the Bayesian SlateMind - and the power of a Strider as a derivative of that - is the ability to make use of these correlations. To perceive the link between information and question - that correlation - requires an unbiased Blank-Slate Mind and efficiency in execution. The efficiency of using information (and correlations) to make predictions - answer questions - is 'Bayesianity'. 

A mind is an engine that burns fuel, how 'good' that fuel is being dependent on how well the information (which is the fuel) correlates with the question. But just as important as the information-fuel is the aforementioned mind-engine. 

The degree to which a mind can make use of correlations is the mind's Bayesianity. Perceiving correlations *where there are none*, subsequently, produces *negative* power, which is of great detriment to Striders. Certainty about something - then - is irrelevant if the means used to reach it are faulty.

**To restate, Bayesianity is seeing patterns only when they are actually present, and only when a correlation exists.**

We can then talk about scaling Bayesian mind-engines; using our example on the composition of a piece of quartz, we can begin with a poor, faulty, barely Bayesian at all engine that erroneously correlates the *had* knowledge of - say - the composition of a piece of calcite, and concludes that that it is quartz. The fact that this example barely even follows to you, the reader, shows how lacking in Bayesianity - and thus, any sense whatsoever.

An engine a few notches above could make the distinction between various materials when seeking to answer the question of 'what is the composition of quartz?'. Given an ensemble of granite, plastic, wool, iron and wood, they can make use of their knowledge about these materials to deduce which would be the most useful in answering the question that is the composition of quartz.

A mind-engine in it's final form is one that can make use of even the slightest correlation to answer questions. Any knowledge had - in the hands of a master Bayesian thinker - *could* have relevance to *any* question at hand, so long as this thinker is willing to plumb the very depths for the dots, and connect the lines between them, no matter how short or inelastic the cord. In the question of the composition of quartz when that of iron is known, the master Bayesian goes down to the fundamental; both iron and quartz are made up of elementary particles - protons, neutrons and electrons - and observing that the behavior of these particles is not unique to iron, but rather exists in both the iron and the quartz. With this connection made, it is possible to deduce the composition of quartz.

## How It All Works
At the intersection of [[The Grand Mechanica]], [[The Blank-Slate Mind]] and [[The Hands as Chalk]] lies the power system of the Switchboard, and at large, the principles by which the entire universe operates. The bridges between all things are manipulated by manipulating chalk. The strength of Striders comes through learning and thinking, and utilizing the information obtained and refined by the former and latter as efficiently as possible. This is in part made possible by a Strider's doctrine, which itself must be as efficiently devised as possible.
