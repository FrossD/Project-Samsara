## The Grand Mechanica
The final realization of [[The Axle of Axles]]. This is a doc that elaborates on all things discussed in A of A, which are then used to write the final iteration of two documents; [[The Blank-Slate Mind]] and another '**Grand Mechanica**' document, which illustrates the operating principles of the Switchboard.

This doc somehow may tie-in the Mysticism.

### Miscellaneous
**Radiantcord**;
Royal family and ranks; 
- Wardens controlled the Holds
- Under the holds are Keeps controlled by Keepmasters
- Keepmasters appoint aides

Radiant Guard; Controlled by the Auric Saber, under them are Lesser Sabers

Colleges controlled by Master Librars. College in Rosenthal (Rose Staff) taught magic, College in (unnamed) taught/trained Radiant Guard. There was a college in Endelm but never decided what it did. Weswynd and Rheazorn were guard cities. 

Church headed by the Auric Staff.

Auditors;
>And many more with a pen. The Radiant Guard conducted global operations, and every arrow fired, or nail hammered had to be accounted for. This was the task of the Auditors, a force of learned persons skilled in language and mathematics, and a position many dreaded. A post among the Auditors was frequently a punishment for gross misconduct, and so the ranks were filled with distinct groups; failed service people seething at their demotion, failed trainees relegated to the safest positions in the guard, corrupt merchants and the equally corrupt guardsmen that worked with them, masochists that truly enjoyed counting grains of rice and stalks of wheat, and the sadists that oversaw them all, growing to derive degenerate pleasure from the thought of labor beyond their office doors.
>It was a party. They had all graduated as Auditors. They knew no other way to celebrate than to argue and drink, and so they yelled plenty and alcohol flowed. A friend sat next to her, waving something resembling a thesis, likely on the workings of battle. The combat-focused Auditors were notorious for their sadism, as their theses featured brutal descriptions on minimizing manpower expenditure in battle. Or maximizing it. Auditors also hated the Radiant Guard, and it was suspected many military failures were the fault of the mathematicians upstairs who had learned to please themselves to reports of losses.

The Clandestins;
Very possible to repurpose in Ven-2. Could even be the random gang that's gonna be so pivotal in doing things.

**Soleisal**;
Major plot point aligned with the Many Worlds Idea and Codefall; huge pyramid-like vault structures dotted the landscape of the Soleisal desert filled with otherworldly tech from outside Discord. Society is a combination of old magics and traditions and barely understood tech harnessed in ways to enhance the former. 

Nomad civilization; clans/major families roam the desert, often camping outside the major pyramids they're raiding at the time. Claim to a pyramid must often be defended against other families. 

Deadly desert; nigh infinite, wholly unmapped, filled with terrors. Idea was for the desert to contain all manners of beasts and brigands and a sort of hybrid between the two, in the form of sentient mummified 'art'. Creatures made almost of patterned textiles and oil paintings. 

[[MDT#^84d439 |Snap Thoughts]]: Cardinarcanics kind of still has a place in Chalk Ritualism, despite how undeveloped it was and is. The vast unending treachery meant to be conveyed by the Soleisal Desert is handled better by the Challenger Dark.

## The Grand Stellar Procession

^476aad
The Grand Stellar Procession dictates most things to do with time and location in the Switchboard.

**Time**
Switchboard 'years' are 10 months long, each month 36 days with six 6-day weeks, creating a block of six-by-six days per month. Weeks are four week 'days' and two week 'ends'. A Switchboard Year is still 365 days, and the last 5 days are a 'limbo' period between the end of one year and the beginning of another. On leap years, the limbo period ends with the 6th day.

Hours, minutes and seconds are dictated by the movement of the stars above (as hour, minute and second hands) and time telling is done via measures of angular degrees 'to' and 'from' an established point. 

**Location**

## The Switchboard Topography
The general structure of the Switchboard as a disk or sphere. It's mathematical pits and valleys. 

Elaborating on the 'bubble-wrap' model and seeing if it works better narratively as a disc or globe. 

The pits of the Legislation Protocol and the 'Worldlines' held up by the 'Outposts/Junctions'. The L. Prot 'pits' being not pits but 'fountains' known as 'Wellsprings' (placeholder).

The hypothetical 'upside down/under the Switchboard'.

Other Switchboard cities, collectively known as the 'Spheric Cities'. Currently a placeholder name, leave it long enough and it will stick eventually.

~~Work on this is being done in the [[The Hands as Chalk]] document.~~ Should get it's own document.

### New Valkyjria

![[Pasted image 20220617173939.png]]

**City Sectors**
Hyacinth
- The more northerly sector of NV. The Academy complex is present here, as well as much of the city's government, banking, white-collar industry etc. Cleaner, upper-class living.

Chrysantheum
- The location right under Hyacinth in the chain, contains most of the heavy industry and the ports for stridcraft. Rubs shoulders with the Conclave of Vahn's head quarters 
 
Freesia
- Residential areas and have most of the crime and is the staging ground for much of NV's underworld. 

**Outskirts**
The Fringe
- An area south of Freesia beyond city limits, much of the illegal trade between other Switchboard cities and the unscrupulous elements of NV is done here.

The Stacks
- A region west of NV that was under development by the Psychitects

## Strider Ritualism
- The Cyclism/Prophetism of Names
Names as a self-fulfilling prophecy; names determine the nature, nature determines the name.

- The Voice of Flowers  
A custom began by McCoy Goldman, the Gentleman Strider. A method of communication between Striders that uses flowers that grow in the expanse of the Switchboard. 

- The Doctrine of Passing  
Refers to both the life of a Strider from birth to death as well as the funeral rites meant to be performed over Striders after their demise.

- The Skywards Pursuit/Pursuit of the Star/Path of the Sky  
The Strider art of finding paths through the Switchboard using the stars above. Involves usage of star charts, the procession calendar and the Sextants. 

- Thy Relics; Thy Mettle
The creation, utlization and nature of Switchboard 'relics', objects of potent information wielded by Striders in the Switchboard for various reasons. The MOD-46 is one such relic, as well as the 'wings', a relic that a Strider uses to better facilitate the Stride.

	The 'relics' thing is very related to the MOD-46 concept, so ensure those are intertwined.

- The Hands as Chalk
Formerly the 'Assembly Protocol'. The principles and ritualism surrounding rituals themselves; their creation, utilization, circumvention and undoing. 

- The Blank-Slate Mind
The nature of knowing. The mind as a blank slate on which that which is known is etched. Compress Teks and Strider Evolution in here as it's most apt.

## "What is a Switchboard Law?"
Residue from older and dead ideas.

Initially, a Switchboard Law was the unmodifiable counterpart to a Strider's Law. A Strider's Law functioned as a sort of 'inherent' Tek that worked passively, as opposed to Teks which are active powers a Strider invokes when needed. A Law would be something a Strider crafts and then 'adds' to the Switchboard via a 'pit', much like adding a document to a folder in a file cabinet, that would then result in that law being a part of the Strider that created it.

A Switchboard law would be that but the Switchboard, until you realize that the laws are just rules the universe worked by and there was no need to call the Laws of the Switchboard, 'Switchboard Laws' as though they were a thing distinct from the Switchboard's worldbuilding.
 
As such, Switchboard Laws are a redundancy, and thus, wholly deprecated. 


---

## The 'Rule' of Threes & Clocking 2.0

	A hypothetical. Currently there are three 'paths' of power in the Switchboard best exemplified by how the Academy groups it's forces; 
	
	- the Operators, Striders using a vast collection of things to grant their power
	- The Psychitects, Chalk Ritualism Purists who operate using the power of Chalk almost solely.
	- The Depthstriders, Striders using the power of void.

### Clocking Dilemma

	It raises the issue of what 'Clocking' is, or meant to be. The Clocking document needs a hard rewrite. Plan can be to scrap it, but the idea of an 'outer path' power is too alluring and useful as a plot device. Currently Clocking functions via;
	
	1. The Variable Instability Core that grants the power to 'Clock'
	2. 'Clocking' itself being frequency and probability manipulation, as well as some elements of control over time.
	3. The core of Clocking being looping events, either returning them to a more desireable original state, or performing a desireable action repeatedly. 
	4. This is done by applying the 60-Law (Now the 1-Law) to an event, dictating how many times that event occurs in a singular second.
	
	This is as far as it goes while remaining somewhat logical and possible to follow. It works off information tangibility; you understand that something occurring is information, and you manipulate a component of that information.
	
	Naturally you try to take it further and see if concepts not neessarily bound to rate-time can be Clocked. An example being position. Position-per-time can be viewed as how many different locations an entity can be at a given time. A sort of measure of randomness, the endgame being Clockers are nigh impossible to track due to the information that is their position being 'Clocked' to output jargon.
	
	This still logically follows somewhat, though more examples are needed to explain what this second stage Clocking does.
	
	The third stage of Clocking is the 'VFRs' or the Variable Frequency Regions, which existed back when Switchboard 'Laws' were a thing and a power, and the ultimate power of a Strider was creating domanins in which they set the rules of engagement. While this still exists in spirit (Structural Casting and Psychitecture in [[The Hands as Chalk]]) in Clocking it can be modified.
	
	The core of the VFRs and third stage Clocking was setting a 'Clock Rule' and a region where that Clock Rule applies. The region is such that, there is a 'balanced' state in the region dictated by the rule, and if that balanced state is not met, the region will take measures to resolve itself such that they are. 
	
	Suppose I drew a circle and applied a ten-apples-per-pear rule to it, anytime I toss a pear in the circle, ten apples will appear as well. The apples don't appear from inexistence, but are rather pulled from existing Latent Chalk in the environs. If an apple is removed from the circle, it resolves back into Chalk, and another apple appears, taking it's place in the circle.
	
	VFR and Clocking then tries to reach a fourth stage, that involves becoming parts of equations and manipulating the laws of physics. The idea was that in an equation, for the LHS to equal the RHS, modifiying one variable induced change in other variables. The Clocker could become one of these variables as a means to exert effects.
	
	Imo, this can be scrapped. The fourth stage delves too far into the psuedo-plausible. Of all the things to be a power, suspending the laws of physics is probably the least interesting, especially in the manner that is planned.
	
	How does Clocking interplay with Chalk and the Void? Perhaps clocks and clocking rules can't be disrupted the way chalk rituals can. That alone makes it particularly hard to work against. It does this by the clocks themselves being clocked to reset to the state at which they were deployed an infinite number of times per second.
	
	The limitations of Clocking are simple and typical; an arbitrary, invisible 'bar' or 'meter' of depletable resource that dictates how many active clocks a Clocker can have at a given time.
	
	So the Clocking Rework;
	**Clocking 'Preamble'**
		1. The Variable Instability Core can be deprecated and replaced with simply 'knowing', under the principles outlined in [[The Blank-Slate Mind]]. 
		2. Clocking summarized is event frequency manipulation, which results in probability manipulation, and produces effects similar to control over time itself. The actual terminology of 'Clocking' stems from the speed of a CPU being known as it's 'Clock Speed', and that clock speed being a measure of a certain number of operations ber second.
		3. The frequency manipulation is done by looping events, to return the event to a more desireable initial state, performing an action repeatedly at a given rate, or to perform an action repeatedly until it produces a desired outcome.
		4. This is all done using a 'Tek' (more a psuedo-Tek) known as the 'Dash-One' Law. It dictates how many times an event occurs in a singular second.

	**Clocking Stages**
		1. Stage One Clocking; elementary frequency manipulation. A coin is flipped and it spins a given number of times per second, I apply a clock to it that either increases or decreases the number of spins per second. I have a firearm that outputs a certain number of rounds per minute, I clock up the firerate to send even more lead downrange.
		2. Stage Two Clocking; abstract interpretative clocking. A parameter that is both dynamic and measurable can be clocked. Location can be clocked, transforming it into random data and making the Clocker untraceable.
		3. Stage Three Clocking; Variable Frequency Regions (name change on the table). Creation of a microregion and manipulation of it by imposing a 'Clock Rule'. The Clock Rule dictates a balanced or equlibrium state, and any deviation from that state is corrected for. The region is dictated via Chalk Ritualism. Suppose I drew a circle and applied a ten-apples-per-pear rule to it, anytime I toss a pear in the circle, ten apples will appear as well. The apples don't appear from inexistence, but are rather pulled from existing Latent Chalk in the environs. If an apple is removed from the circle, it resolves back into Chalk, and another apple appears, taking it's place in the circle.
	
	This seems to be a sufficient outline for Clocking. An idea however, is the usage of Clocking in structural casting.

## Teks (Combat)
The classification of kinds of combat Teks.

Ideas;
- Elementals: use the conventional magic powers like throwing fire and lightning. Another word can be Manifesters. Was thinking of Thaumaturges but it's too heavy on magical implications. 
- Vector-manipulators: Manipulate vectors. Forces. Need cool name. Psions. Vectors. Graphers. Redirectors.
- Sequencers: No idea what they do but the name is cool.
- Constructors: Or assemblers. Chalk constructs. Blocks. Walls. Big things. Brute force. They're Minecraft players. The initial idea for Psychitecture.
- Augmenters: Tek that enhances the preexisting. Better eyesight. Or agility. Super strength and speed. Faster thinking. 

Any name should get contracted to sound shorter and snappier. Redirectors to Redirs. Redeers. Red Ears. Don't know how we got here. 

Where would teleportation as a power go?

Suppose the elementals are called the Sequencers, what is being sequenced? Perhaps it comes down to how they understand and replicate existing phenomena and re-sequence it. It's a stretch but it works. Taken further, they could just be phenomena copiers or replicators. 

Ideas 2;
- **Sequencers**: Elementary copy-pasters. Able to grasp simple phenomena, modify them, deploy them for use. Use the more conventional powers like fire, lightning, elemental stuff. Able to copy other Teks though varies in proficiency.
- Currently, **Redirectors**: Control over vectors and forces. Able primarily to change direction, higher levels can alter magnitude as well.
- Currently, **Psychitects**: Geometry and patterns. Creating blocks and spheres. Constructs. The most capable structural casters. Assembly and disassembly powers.
- **Augmenters:** Enhancers and modifiers. Upgrade the preexisting; better eyesight, hearing, senses in general. Faster reflexes. Parallel thinking. 

And the fifth;
- **Esoterics**: The jokers and wildcards. Powers that escape typical classification. Esoteric Teks often modify the other Teks classifications, changing them in ways that produce upgrades or side-grades.

## Void 3.0
The redesign of the Void, namely;
- The Void as a Location
- The Void as a Power
- The Void-Stride and Void Drifters

### The Shape of the Void
The Void possess a global curvature that grants it it's shape, and this curvature dictates what can occupy the Void, as well path taken when passing through it. The global curvature additionally slows down anything attempting to pass through it, via its effect of global deceleration, which exists as a result of it's curvature. 

The presence of Information induces information density, which further warps the Void but a considerably smaller scale, causing 'local curvature', and the Void itself warps and bends on smaller scales - relative to the global scale - causing flux storms ([[The Skywards Pursuit]]). Throwing an object out into inter-regional space should result in consistent deceleration then, but due to small dips, dings, curves and bends along the way, it is not so.

**The Depth of the Void**
Independent of the Void's behavior in three-dimensional space is it's depth in the fourth dimension, function as a massive cave system or the rest of a waterbody below the surface. 

	It additionally explains a plothole of why objects with zero momentum (such as Law Stars) don't fall into the Void, but are rather seemingly affixed in place. It is due to the shallowness of the Void at that specific region, ignoring the curvature.

A base depth of Void needs establishing. A Void a kilometer deep at it's shallowest allows neutron stars to be somewhat above 'v-level'. A Strider however, is not a kilometer tall and so falling even into impossibly shallow Void means loss to the Challenger Dark. This is why the Strider Protocol is essential; it allows moving too fast - much like a stone skipped across water - to fall into the Void.

The imperfect nature of the Void can also be exploited by particularly proficient Striders to perform deft maneuvers during the Stride, described best as skipping a stone to reach the edge of a whirlpool, bending it from it's initial path to reach another shore.

### The Void vs. The Strider Protocol
The Stride is performed by gathering Chalk and flaring it to produce momentum. The Void however, interferes due to it's curvature, causing a net deceleration from initial speed due to it's bumps and warps.

	As a narrative point, early Striders with no knowledge of the Void could have assumed that inter-regional space possessed something akin to 'air-resistance' that slowed down the Stride, produced by som unknown fluid. This was the case until an Einstein-analogue came up with a more complete description of mechanics by somehow measuring the Void. Historically this was done by measuring the curvature of light from a star 'around the sun' (ask Hex for clarification) during an eclipse. Similar thing can be done (leaning towards 'should be done') with information flow.

	As a further sidenote, this is a very workable way to introduce Vahn as a character in mythos, as the arrival of someone from functionally, down under, radically shakes up known science, propmting new inquiry.

### Veils
Veils can be products of either infinite curvature, such that all travel curves into the Void unavoidably, and thus cannot be traversed - or infinite depth, which can be traversed depending on curvature, but recovery from falling in is impossible.

We lean towards the former idea; the Void has finite but in some regions, indescribable depth, with singularities and discontinuities being impossible to traverse.

	Ask Hex for clarification on 'singularities' and 'discontinuities'.

The above warp your momentum to nothing, and attempting to traverse them results in falling into the Challenger Dark. 

### Veils (Doc Version)
Veils are products of infinite curvature of the Void, such that all travel across them curves into the Void unavoidably, rendering them impossible for regular Striders and even Depthstriders to travel. They warp all momentum to nothing, and any attempting to traverse them is inescapably dragged into the Challenger Dark.

The Veils present an immense obstacle to travel in the Switchboard. They can be imagined as immense walls that cordon off sections of the Switchboard from each other. Floating curtains in 3D space, the way around too long and the way through impossible. The most common method to pass a Veil is doing so in the Challenger Dark. Veils in the Switchboard correspond to points of immense treachery in the dark below, as the infinite pull of Veils means oddities from near and far (both within the Switchboard and the dark) are drawn and accumulate just below it. Passing the treacherous roads in the Challenger Dark and travelling a safe distance away allows reemerging on the other side of the Veil.

The most optimal way of crossing a Veil, however, is with a Void Drifter. Void Drifters can induce infinite anti-curvature to cancel out a Veil's infinite curvature, the resultant of this being zero, allowing safe passage through the Veil.

Because of the barrier presented by Veils and the relative rarity of Void Drifters, many regions in the Switchboard are resigned to their sectors, with little communication happening between sectors, effectively ensuring most regions remain isolationist.

### Void Striders
The Void Stride works on the principle of *negative information.*

The Void has natural curvature, but the presence of information creates information density, which produces additional curvature. The Void necessarily has it's own 'gravity', which can be interpreted as further curvature along a fourth dimension, except thoroughly uniform. Thus, escaping the Void requires 'falling upwards', but this simply isn't possible due to the Void's curvature.

However, if information produces density which produces curvature, then it follows that *negative information* can produce *negative information density*, which expectedly results in *negative curvature*, which cancels out existing curvature, and allows escaping the pull of the Void. Thus, traversing the Void requires the creation of negative information. Negative information grants the power to unbend space, and with bending and unbending working in tandem, you are granted the power to void-stride. 

	The problem now is what negative information even is, in-universe.

### Giving and Taking
Taking from nothing requires becoming less than nothing, and this will be done by 'cancelling out' your information with negative information, opening yourself to the Void, and allowing it to fill without consuming. 

	The Less-Than-Blank-Slate Mind.

>"Stare into nothing. See the shape of absence. And maintain the knowledge of who you are."

Doing so allows emerging from the Void with more than what you entered with.

	We got deep into the cool lingo here. More clarification on what exactly is being done here is needed.

As for giving, things fall into the Void. A query can be passed, focusing on a wish or desire, and allow what was already present to emerge. Its functionally ransacking the depths of the Void for whatever has fallen to it, such as the corpses of Striders past, or the more useful contents of Chalk streams that pour into it ceaselessly.

The advantage of Giving as a power is that it doesn't require nearly as much mental proficiency and fortitude. Giving allows for relative vagueness if the one asking isn't particularly concerned with the results, or the question being asked doesn't have particularly terrible consequences if - as an analogy - you were wishing upon a monkey's paw, or a very untrustworthy genie.

This is a double-edged sword however, as particularly vague inquiries may unearth things an asker would rather not come up, like asking for 'something really cool' resulting in an arm frozen in liquid nitrogen. Vague questions can unseal horrors; being arbitrary - though it can result in immense payoff - is rarely wise.

Giving and Taking are two sides of the same coin, with the difference being specificity of the search, and the accuracy of the results. Taking allows precise search due to exact knowledge of what is needed, allowing acquiring exactly what is needed, or shaping it from Void if it is not present. Taking could be split into The Power to Demand and the Power to Shape.

	Shaping is a power I think best reserved for Void Drifters.

Giving is granted additional advantages when the Void as Being is considered. Taking requires knowledge of what is desired, meaning what is acquired is already Known. Being Given is reaching into a very deep box filled with nearly anything, and as such, rare knowledge can be obtained, and what is obtained can be shaped by the Void as a Being.

A fair example of a limitation of Giving is asking for the corpse of someone alive. Since it is not present in the Void, it cannot be Given. However, were you to Know the entirety of the information of that person, you would theoretically be able to shape them from Void, using the power to Take. 

	As a narrative appendum, Giving and Taking having some elements of asymmetry and subsequently, spectrumicity (is that a word?) allows for some kind of hypocrisy among the faithful of Vahn, with those who dress themselves as followers of Vanity making requests that border on Avarice. 

#### Further Notes on Giving & Taking
Could Taking be perhaps a product of creating negative information with a shape - that shape being created by the intent of the taker - and have information, which will be what is desired, fill that negative information shape?

For example, if I wanted to take a cup from the Void, would I do so first by creating a 'negative' cup, reaching into the Void, and having that shape of 'negative cup' be filled by a regular cup? It very much seems to correlate with the initial idea of 'letting the Void fill you'. Perhaps it is not enough to just 'see' the shape of absence; you must create it as well.

Further specificity that is needed to Take could stem from not being able to get the exact positive information analogue of the negative information 'void' created. If I want a red cup and no such red cup exists, the Void might place a blue cup in my hands. But it will never give me a bowl.

It does still work with the initial idea of becoming less-than-nothing if forming a negative information 'void' was done - as an example - by inducing that void within yourself. Taking could be the manifestation of the desire to be complete; by inducing a hole, and using the Void to obtain the appropriately-(enough)-sized peg with which to fill it. It follows that something you want is necessarily, something you don't have, and (this works with both Giving and Taking) the aim is to obtain that from the Void.

Some things can't be Given however, and what can't be given must be Taken.

The issue of specificity is solved by Void Drifters, who's power to Take extends beyond Demanding, to the power to Shape. With it, you can obtain exactly what is desired from the Void.

### The Blackout Arrow (and Depthstrider Combat)
The Blackout Arrow - functioning by drawing information towards it - does so by inducing local curvature. Functionally, Depthstrider combat should revolve around inducing curvature and anti-curvature using information and negative information. 

	Do Depthstriders effectively have gravity powers? Yes. This is not the path we chose, but it's the most rational one. 

	Find that mock-up for the third Destiny 2 Darkness Subclass that featured gravity-based powers. That thing was pretty cool but 'Massweilders' as a class name is pure ass. 

[(3) Fan Concept for 3rd Darkness subclass for Lightfall : destiny2 (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/m1j2ls/fan_concept_for_3rd_darkness_subclass_for/)

#### Further Notes on Depthstrider Combat
Adapting from other notes (The [[The Void#Depthstrider Combat |Depthstrider Combat]] section in the Void 2.0 doc as well as the Theory of Damage section of Strider Combat) we can view Depthstrider's methods of fighting Striders is inflicting physical damage via curvature manipulation, and Lattice damage using the nature of the Void to gather information to itself.

The Void's power to 'pull' information to cause damage is the inverse of Law Stars causing damage by constantly outputting intense waves of Chalk. Law Stars would take your shirt off by blowing on you until it flies off your back, while the Void would grab your collar and rip it off you from the front. It behaves similarly towards Lattices, aiming to undo them by pulling on the weakest threads so the rest comes apart.

Because of this, the second aspect of Depthstrider Combat is disruption; aiming to disrupt all Chalk-reliant systems. The apparent pull of the Void induces pressure on Chalk, weakening it, producing inaccuracy and inconsistency, which can be exploited by the rest of a Depthstrider's arsenal. 

Particularly proficient use of this pull can allow Depthstriders to steal secrets and information from their opponents, and due to Information Tangibility principles, it results in the weakening of the one taken from, and increased strength for the Depthstrider. Protracted matches favor Depthstriders, who continuously adapt in their fight against an opponent, as more and more of their nature is Learned by the Void Strider.

## Skywards Pursuit Appendum
**Rough**
- Tracking Stars that undergo Procession
- Regional Stars and Regional Equations

### Regional Modeling
The model of regions is similar to a conventional planet, consisting of a solid spheroid center, a layer of atmosphere, and - due to the nature of the Switchboard - a final layer viewable as a barrier or membrane, that serves to contain the contents of the region. This final layer is maintained both by the regional equation and the anchorage superstructure that connects a region to the Wellspring that birthed it. 

### Regional Equations
A regional equation is a complex engine that takes in raw Chalk and produces a region. In actuality, it is a singular unit that consists of hundreds of smaller equations who's processes within themselves and interactions with others produces the properties of the region they govern.

All things you would typically associate with a planet - such as weather and climate, plate tectonics, ocean-to-land ratio, gravity, soil nature (such as acidity), mineral distribution in the
crust, depth of the crust and all things under it, and more esoteric properties such as prevalence of Latent Chalk - are all controlled by the regional equation.

Regional Equations also have a 'coefficient of evolution'. Regional equations are formed from spontaneous equations that evolve over time, but their evolution continues even after the region reaches relative stability. This variable adds a degree of randomness to every single calculation undergone in the regional equation, producing subtle changes in the nature of the region, observable usually only if consciously tracked, or after long periods of time. The activities of Striders and external factors in the Switchboard can alter this coefficient, producing radical effects. 

Particularly skilled groups of Striders can concoct and execute a ritual that allows directly interfacing with a regional equation, and subsequently altering the entire region as they see fit. Expectedly, this is an immensely delicate task, with considerably dire ramifications when executed improperly. Why it's most commonly done, however, is to alter the region's sky, and regional stars.

### Regional Stars
Regional Stars differ from Law Stars in that they don't exist. Regional Stars are the product of a region's Regional Equation, and instead of being actual stars, are instead projections in the sky. Being projections, lensing effects lend them the illusion of immense distance, as well as their brightness. Their movement patterns are also dictated by the regional equation. 

Typically, regional stars function as clock - just on a cosmological scale. The regional equation pulls Switchboard time from the Astrolabe Super-Region, and maps seconds, minutes, hours - even days, weeks and months - to the movement of stars in the sky. 

That said however, because they are projections, and because the Regional Equation is editable, it is not written in any law that regional stars must be use to tell Switchboard time, or time at all, or even create the phenomena of day-night cycles.

Some regions choose to have stars tell time since the inception of the region, rather than Switchboard time that counts from *t=0*; the dawn of the Switchboard. Additionally, regional stars can have their brightness controlled, a region with particularly dim stars may never have a 'day', instead existing in perpetual night. The speed at which they seeming orbit a region can be tuned too, meaning a region may have days longer or shorter than the typical twenty four hours.

Some stars are purely cosmetic. A region can assemble and deploy a constellation of stars that appear only on a significant day, acting as a cosmic tapestry relaying the sequence of events they describe. Singular stars can mark significant dates, such as births, deaths and discoveries. 

### Appendum To Stellar Processions: How to Track Moving Stars
Tracking Stars is done via two means: sequencing their pulse patterns, and following the trails they leave behind as they move. 

The first is that stars have a unique 'signature' that can be sequenced by monitoring the patterns in it's inconsistent rate of Chalk output. The star varies in the rate at which it outputs Chalk, such as five seconds of full (100%) output, thirteen seconds of 45% output, and nine seconds of 10% output, creating a sequence that looks something like [5(100), 13(45), 9(10)]. 

The second is that stars as they move - much like how chalk leaves white streaks on a blackboard - they leave streaks in the Sky. These trails are pure Chalk lingering in place, and following them can lead right back to the Star. As an idea, it can be one of the sources of Malachite Streams across the sky, as the Star induces a current of Chalk radiating from it as it moves in a direction opposite to the one it is moving. A star moving from a previously unreachable region to a well explored one is similar to sand-filling a river to make a new path across, granting Striders a way into the new frontier. 



## The Blank-Slate Mind: Finding Teks
Adapted from Hex's discussion: https://discord.com/channels/699722310910738513/1026484056759750697/1027730801590284389

Teks are intricately patterned Chalk that forms equations, which take the shape of wieldable powers used by Striders as tools or as weapons in combat. An essential part of the growth of a Strider to power and prominence is finding and mastering a Tek, which then raises the question of how Teks can be found.

Teks being Chalk equations work under the same principles as Chalk, particularly the ones outlined under '**Spontaneous Equations**' in [[The Hands as Chalk]]. Teks form from Latent Chalk that accumulates and due to a certain amount of internal self-correction, grow, change, and evolve over time into coherent, functional equations. 

	As a random thought, it would make sense logically if the evolution of latent chalk to a Tek would be truly completed through further refinement by Striders. It seems somewhat - if not fairly - absurd that the ability to, for example, form balls of fire is just a 'thing' that 'becomes' even if it takes considerable time and happens in favorable conditions. Narratively, it further works to stress Teks as not just a thing Striders 'do', but in ways, they 'are'. A Strider *is* their Tek because their Tek is most likely unique, and almost synonymous with their name, often being the means by which they are recognized.

Where are Teks formed then? Primarily, in Wellsprings. Law Stars emit pure streams of Chalk  endlessly, which accumulate in regions, saturating them with the raw potential of unharnessed chalk. These regions - the Wellsprings - are where Teks form over long periods of time. 

	As an appendum, if all that is needed for Teks to form is latent chalk and time, then it is fair to say they aren't exclusive to the Wellsprings. What truly are the limits to where a Tek can generate? Can there be a regional Tek, created by the proximity of people in the region or the regional equation itself, to a crystalline deposit of chalk?
	
	It seems perfectly rational that Vaults would thave Teks within them as well, placed there by the powers that created the Vault, or evolving over time in the information-dense environments they present.

How then are Teks found? Teks typically reach near-completion in the same general area the evolution process began, meaning that a vast majority of Teks are hidden or encased in layers and layers of chalk, making them hard to detect. Teks are ordered chalk, but ordered in a manner that doesn't make it easily distinguishable from unordered, random Chalk. 

To answer a complex question simply, finding a Tek is a matter of identifying negentropy; 'negative chaos'. It is finding pi or Avogadro's number or the gravitational constant in a sea of random numbers. Doing so without any aid is nigh impossible, and so tools, tricks and just plain experience create the divide between Striders who can find Teks as though they called out their names, and Striders who never see one in their lifetime. 

To answer a complex question with the equivalent complexity it deserves, imagine travelling across a frozen tundra, sheets of ice as far as the eyes can see. Blizzards strike - seemingly - whenever they choose. Altitude varies, with valleys featuring colder temperatures leading into mountains promising deadly exposure. And then, without explanation, you find a patch of verdant, green grass. Next to it, a larger patch. Next to *that*, an even larger patch, this one with flowers blooming pleasantly within it. You follow these patches until they merge and grow, becoming a large field - and at the center of it - a pool of clear, steaming hot water.

This is a more obvious Tek. It alters the environment around it indisputably, in a manner visible to all who take a casual glance. In homogeneity of the icy wastes, any deviation from the expected is most rationally explained by esoteric factors. It is similar in the Switchboard; a Tek may shape the environment around - sometimes dangerously - and Striders are tasked with locating the abstract 'center' of the deviation, and retrieve the Tek from within.

Some Teks, however, are more complex.

Returning to the frozen tundra, suppose you set up a monitoring facility and observed the tundra for three months (108 days, as a Switchboard 'month' is 36 days). You chart the resulting data and find... oddities. Blizzards hit on the sixth and eighteenth of each month. Snowdrifts grew and shrank by multiples of seventeen. Auroras hit at the start of every month. Polar animals migrated in pack sizes of ascending prime numbers, following zig-zagging paths at alternating angles. It is far too much coincidence, something greater must be at work. 

Noticing these intricacies without conscious measurement will undoubtedly take time, and noticing some (such as Auroras at the start of every month) are somewhat explainable away, prompting no further inquiry. However, a discerning mind will able to observe these occurrences and draw a more apt conclusion; a line of negentropy - 'anti-chaos' - in the cacophony.

Finding Teks is a test of a Strider's ability to find patterns, consistencies, similarities, in deluges of chalk. 

	There is a point Hex tried to make on Bayesianity 'being' the Blank-Slate Mind, but I did not fully grasp it. I will ask them to elaborate more.

## InfoConsol and Further Consolidation
A document that outlines the behavior of Chalk in the Switchboard. The Grand Stellar Procession but for something far simpler. There's an argument to be made that this document is an extension of Information Tangibility, as all discussion on information inevitably needs to factor in it's tangibility.

- [[The Void]]
	- Information having 'mass' and this 'mass' being able to induce density and subsequently, curvature.

As we delve into the possibility of further consolidation, it might be a good idea to fold some docs into [[The Strider Protocol]], especially ones like Strider Combat (similar to how Void Strider Combat is kept in [[The Void]] document) and some more information on Strider toolkits.

## Theorizing Depthstrider Combat Methods
### Foundational Methods
The core of Depthstrider combat being gravity manipulation presents a selection of abilities that appear constrained at first, but with creativity, can demonstrate to be particularly varied and quite powerful.

Point attraction and point repulsion are the basics, and functionally give a Depthstrider spatial control of a battlefield. Offensively, placing attraction and repulsion points allows forcefully moving combatants and objects in any direction the void-wielder chooses. Defensively, projectiles can be deflected off-course by interfering gravitational fields, or locked in place by the resultant of counteracting gravitational forces. 

It presents brute force methods of engagement. An opponent can be flattened under immense repulsive force acting above them, or flung repeatedly into objects or have objects flung repeatedly into them. 

As a utility power, gravity manipulation can allow for flight and moving large objects, as well as dexterous movement at high speeds (think gravity slingshot maneuvers but for someone running on the ground). Fine application of gravitational force - such as extremely minute, immensely weak forces of attraction and repulsion - can be used for far more delicate work, such as moving cylinders to pick a lock, or opposing forces producing spin, allowing removal of screws in watches, as an example.

Currently, gravity manipulation works as a very ranged power, allowing exerting considerable lethality from afar. Close range applications exist as well, when it is considered that a brief moment - a 'pulse' - of immense attraction or repulsion, can rapidly accelerate anything in the vicinity, allowing adding more force to certain actions.

A bladed weapon could have a point of immense attraction tethered to it's cutting edge, effectively pulling it along as the user moves for a swing, manufacturing additional force behind each attack. Similarly, a blunt weapon such as a hammer can be propelled from rest to immense velocity by 'pulsing' a repulsive force behind it, amplifying it's destructive power. Projectiles - both thrown and propelled - can be accelerated similarly.

### Esoteric Methods
Delving into the speculative, in what ways can the gravity powers of Depthstriders be used?

The first example is 'paired' points of attraction and repulsion; instead of indiscriminately attracting or repelling everything in the vicinity, pairs or sets of points can only act on each other, similar to two-way radios. Additionally, an attraction or repulsion point could be modified to only attract or repel designated objects. A Void Strider could tether an attraction point to an opponent, and fling projectiles attuned to that point, causing them to 'home in' on the target. 

Also to consider is that with enough gravity, light itself can be dragged towards a point and consumed. An intense point of gravitational attraction could produce a region of impenetrable shadow, while one of immense repulsion would be awash with blinding light. Pulsing the latter could serve as a 'gravity flashbang', the brightness disorienting targets. 

#### Redacted
	Far more to come under this section after the [Redacted Event on Thursday, October 20th ;)]

**Case Study**: The Blackout Arrow

The Blackout Arrow - functioning by drawing information towards it - does so by inducing local curvature. Functionally, Depthstrider combat should revolve around inducing curvature and anti-curvature using information and negative information. 

	Do Depthstriders effectively have gravity powers? Yes. This is not the path we chose, but it's the most rational one. 

	Find that mock-up for the third Destiny 2 Darkness Subclass that featured gravity-based powers. That thing was pretty cool but 'Massweilders' as a class name is pure ass.

## Void Drifter Powers - Dynamic Coupling Constant
There exists a relationship between curvature of space and dilation of time, an amount of the former producing a certain amount of the latter. The ratio this relationship is subjected to is known as the Coupling Constant.

When Void Striders alter curvature as they Stride or fight, the spatial distortion produces a corresponding amount of temporal distortion. Due to the coupling constant however, even immense amounts of spatial distortion produce very little distortion in time. A Void Strider at their absolute pinnacle cannot produce enough spatial distortion to amount to many, many fractions of a second gained or lost.

Void Drifters however, can produce considerable temporal distortion without need for much spatial. They do so by altering the coupling constant itself. Void Drifters are the only information-wielders with any true dominance over time itself. 

## Assimilated Snap Thoughts

### Uncategorized (Complete)
- Clocking and [[The Void]] existing as non-Chalk derivative powers that grant power outside the Ritualism. The void stride draws it's power from the Void and Clocking can be an artificial creation. Meant as narrative elements to provide the Grounded with power to fight on similar footing with Striders.
	- It creates room for a Clocking-derivative form of Striding. Worth thinking about.
- Chalk is the antithesis to Glass, and Glass is what obstructs the propagation of Chalk. ^98319c

### Major
- Switchboard Topography; 'Malachite' superstructures the source of all chalk. Spheric city regions hinged on supersized 'chains' that let them 'hang' in three dimensional space off other nearby regions. Collapse of these chains is what led to the fall of Dustarin.
- Grand Stellar Procession; The 'Law' stars that appear in all regions everywhere. Permanent stars that exist in 3D space between regions, and are used for Wayfinding across the Switchboard. The 'clock' stars are projected upon the sky of every region by their regional equation. Wayfinding is done with the Sextants. ^13d480



## SkyPur: The Snap-Shrink
The shape of a region is kept intact by the anchorage superstructures linked to it. These superstructure 'chains' link directly into the region's regional equation, acting to keep it functional. When the superstructures collapse, the regional equations collapses in upon itself, and the region follows suit.

Regional equation collapse is less of a collapse in the sense of the pillars folding in and the roof falling down, but is more likened to decay. Once the supports are snapped, the equation gradually comes undone, patterns of woven chalk ribbon slowly beginning to unravel and fray. The result of this is natural disasters in the region; runaway climate, unstable plate tectonics and more. The last bit of the region to collapse is it's sky, it's stars winking out, replaced by the unfiltered sky of the Switchboard, light coming from distant Law Stars. 

At this, great cracks cascade across the region, fissures that split continent-sized landmasses, stretching down to the core. Unraveled chalk pushes at these landmasses from beneath, propelling them upwards and outwards away from the region's core, drifting into the Switchboard Sky. Regions decay by shattering, expelling chunks of themselves out into intra-regional space.

The last dregs of the regional equation collapse in upon itself, forming a core with immense leftover power; the gravity axle.

### The Gravity Axle
A gravity axle is a dense core of woven chalk, containing the last dregs of a region's power. Before a region' collapse, the gravity axle is a singular wheel in the expansive gear-box of a regional equation, serving a function relating to the curvature induced by the information mass of the region. Upon collapse, it is the last thing left in the cadaverous shattered fields in the Sky.

Mere shards of them are highly coveted for the dense chalk contained within, but they are most valued for their usage in rituals, particularly in those used in creating regions of your own.

## Information Consolidation et al.
### Outline of the Endeavor
The final shape of information as a power. InfoConsol is an endeavor to consolidate the mechanics of Information within the Switchboard, as well as off-shoots of it that are fairly intertwined with it, such as [[The Hands as Chalk]] and [[The Strider Protocol]]. 

A large amount of it is combining fragmented documents into cohesive wholes, packed with detail.

##### Depthstrider Combat
A quote from Blakk;
> Concerning the last point, the natural extension of that is force fields, a sharply defined area of so much repulsive force that nothing can exist within it. This can then be used much like clay, ie, to sculpt all sorts of things. Platforms, shields, swords whatnot. You can work out the exact details. This is of course immensely difficult, shaping the inverse square law into clearly defined boundaries requires fine control over the dense points of anti-information, which is why only powerful Striders are able to do it.
> Also remember that gravity warps not just space, but time, namely time runs slower in areas with high gravity. If anti gravity is also a feature, then time runs faster there, in reverse. I think we've all seen enough Matrix to know why slowing time in an area around yourself can be immensely useful, but it can also be used to, say, accelerate natural processes. For example, a Void Strider can accelerate time to hasten the decay of a Strider's information. A Strider with fine precision could possibly also create fields of gravity and antigravity with themselves to accelerate or slow down bodily functions.

This section simply requires creativity. Describe how Depthstrider combat is reliant on gravity manipulation. Work from there.

## Glass 3.0
Incredibly, I found something to do with Glass. The Vitric Shelf, Anarhiza, the DevitNET, this stuff can very much be used to realize my 'Garden of Glass' vision for a final frontier of the Switchboard, one nigh impossible to traverse by Striders. It can work. 

### Legacy: Glass 1.0+2.0
The notes on Glass retrieved from [[The Hands as Chalk]].

---
Adapted from legacy Glass (1.0) doc.

	Glass serves as a sort of antithesis to Chalk. Materially they are different and yet similar, interacting in manners that mirror how Glass as an information void behaves towards Chalk as information density.
	Materially;
	- Chalk cannot stain Glass, but Glass can carve deep into chalk.
	- Glass shatters, Chalk flakes.
	- Glass in shard form is immensely dangerous, sharp enough to easily pierce skin. Chalk breaks into harmless chunks.
	- Both can reach a powdered state, Glass becoming more dangerous and Chalk becoming more harmless.

Glass is a Switchboard phenomena best understood as a transparent glass 'box' around the viewers head, which is best understood as a blank chalk-slate. Chalk attempts to mark the blank-slate of the mind, but fails due to the interference of Glass.

Glass serves as a means to prevent the movement and activity of Chalk/information. It has it's uses in insulating things against Strider powers, but it's origin lies in the ear of the Mysticism. When it was understood that the secrets of the Mystics drove Striders insane, Glass was developed as a countermeasure, preventing the secrets of the Mystics from implanting themselves in the minds of Striders. 

'Taking the Glass' as it came to be called was done typically by consuming a prepared measure of it, designed to insulate the mind against a given subject matter. The process is typically irreversible, and this presented ethical issues when discovered. Taking Glass produces no noticeable physical change, meaning it could be forced on a Strider whilst they are unaware, and they'd have no way of knowing without encountering the information they are insulated from, or speaking to a professional.

These 'professionals' are Strider Glassbreakers, Striders versed in manipulating and removing Glass. The exact methods of doing so varies from Strider to Strider, but what is a constant is that it is impossible to wholly remove Glass without fault or flaw. Much like punching a window, it leaves sharp corners and ends. Striders who have been 'Shattered' in this regard can learn the information they were shielded from, but it causes them immense anguish.

#### Further Uses
Glass became an effective treatment for various traumas endured by Striders. Either from upbringing, general living, or by encountering information bordering on cognitohazardous, or any other threats to the mind presented by the Switchboard. 

#### Perception
Some Striders oppose the existence of Glass as it is the antithesis of their power. Others do so as they view it as 'ultimate cowardice'; voluntarily choosing ignorance in a world where knowledge is true strength.

	Further elaboration is best done in [[The Doctrine of Passing]].

#### Instrument Six (Tentative)
The ported Instrument Six document, adapted under Chalk principles as a derivative of Glass.

I-6 is the colloquial name for the first successful instance of anti-Strider weaponry that doesn't require being a Strider or possessing a relic.

It's history is that it was developed as a countermeasure against the Strider Mystics during their stint terrorizing the Switchboard. Because of the nature of the Mystics' power, fighting them conventionally was insufficient, and a new method - attacking their Strider Protocol itself - was necessary.

Being an information weapon, it functions according to information principles. It takes the form of a hypodermic syringe or hollow bullet modified to deliver a payload of a Chalk equation combined with a measure of Glass that is tailored to attack a small section of the Strider Protocol, overwriting it with emptiness.

Variants of it were created;
		1. I-6As, which only temporarily suppresses the ability to Stride. It is widely used and regarded as an underhanded method to gain an upper-hand in a fight.
		2. I-6Ds or 'sixties', the actual military grade iteration of it, locking down the ability to Stride to facilitate suppression and capture. However, it's effects can be undone using various methods. For every ritual there are counter rituals.
		3. I-6Rs 'rulebreakers', an iteration designed to attack the Strider Protocol of victims as well as the Mysticism itself. It ultimately led to the downfall of the Mystics.
		4. I-6Es 'executioners', issued by courts as a punitive measure, and cannot be undone. It irreversibly destroys the Strider Protocol, and makes those inflicted with it, 'Slow'.

The existence of I-6 drives endless conflict across the Switchboard, as they are the simplest way to defeat a Strider. Despite them being outlawed, black markets make them fairly available, and even morally upstanding Striders carry at least I-6As as a last resort.
