# The Cyclicality of Names
The concept of Strider Titles goes here. Like Russel Walls being the Strider Exalted and Ventura the Strider Sojourner.

## Names and Information Tangibility
Names connect to Information Tangibility in that names are intrinsic properties of things within the Switchboard. All things have names, and all things that there will ever be have been named. All names there will ever be already exist, and naming something for the first time is merely fulfilling an outcome determined from the very inception of the Switchboard.  ^d212a2

Because names are information themselves, they are subject to similar rules such as the Chalk Ritualism and have rules of their own. 

## The Cyclicality
All names having already existed and all 'naming' being fulfillment of pre-determined outcomes has a minor caveat that simultaneously plays into this principle. While all names are predetermined, the name given to a thing will make it grow more into it's nature, altering it's information as a result.

A sword is predetermined to have been called a sword since the inception of the Switchboard, and in calling it a sword, it becomes truer to its nature of sharpness. However, things that are sharpened through other means become more sword-like in nature, and can hence take up 'sword' as a sort of latent, hidden name.

Naming things influences their nature, and their nature grants them names. This is the Cyclicality of Names.

## Names as Power
As names are information and an intrinsic quality of a thing, names can be given to a thing to manifest those qualities in it. A pen may be called a sword, and this alters the pen's information in that it becomes more like a sword. The pen may not necessarily become capable of stabbing or slashing, but it may gain the power to divide, to cut, to draw blood in it's actions. The more people (Striders especially) call a thing by a name, the more it alters it's nature. A pen may never become a sword, but it may cut even keener than the finest one could ever hope to.

**For Striders**
It applies to an extent to Striders themselves, though with rules. A Strider who calls himself 'God' and who is called 'God' by other Striders won't necessarily gain godhood or godlike power. Sincere belief in 'God' being an apt name for a the Strider is required for the power of 'God' as name to manifest. In a sense, a Strider must alter their nature to be godlike to be meaningfully called 'God', further demonstrating the cyclicality.

It is far more common for Striders to name themselves after a virtue, or principle, or creed, or object, or some assembly of letters given meaning solely by virtue of it being a name. Being called by their name further enforces the nature of the Strider, and Strider's who's name is called with greater feeling (hatred, reverence, love) grow truer to their nature and stronger as a result. Striders strive primarily for memorable names that are in themselves statements; that in calling their name, you inadvertently bring the deeds of it's bearer to the fore.

**Teks and Relics**
Also particularly affected by names are Teks and Relics; powers and instruments of power that themselves have a nature that determines a name, and names that further solidify their nature. Teks and Relics that evolve naturally via Latent Chalk come with their own names, that become known to Striders using them on contact. Teks and Relics created by Striders are subsequently named by them, reflective of the nature of the Relic/Tek and the Strider that wields them.

For this reason Striders put in significant effort in naming things that will be associated with them, though it is taken further.

## Strider 'Ballads'
	An operating name, and a section probably more suited for [[The Doctrine of Passing]]

The core principle is that things with names accrue stories. As they exist, act, are acted with or acted upon, these actions and events become apart of the named entity's information, granting it further significance and power. While natural evolved Reliteks accrue power typically from the sheer volume and density of unutilized information flowing around them, created Reliteks wielded by Striders follow the Strider in their Passing, living with them, gathering the information of the events around them, and growing as a result.

As such, Reliteks grow more powerful with age and experience, aging like wine. And the principle applies to Striders too, in line with principles elaborated upon in [[The Blank-Slate Mind]]. Striders grow in age and experience, and what they witness and survive makes them stronger as a result.

Named entities gain the power to witness the Switchboard, and by doing so they become stronger, more like their names, truer to their nature.

Striders go even further however, in that becoming truer to a nature grants something higher than a name; a title. A title is a name, perfected.

## Strider Titles and Titular Powers

^7e23b9

A Title is a perfected name.

The cyclicality is such that name drives nature and nature drives name, and can assume that name drives higher nature, higher nature drives even higher name, and eventually this crystallizes as a tangible phenomena in the Switchboard. These are titles. 

A Title is feat and philosophy made manifest. The actions of Striders in the Switchboard can crystallize into tangible form, such that those who continue those actions play into a greater philosophy, a philosophy that evolved from repetition of said actions. These actions and philosophies are 'truer' means of being a Strider, and are given names. These names are Titles then assigned to Striders who imbibe the nature of those names.

Most common are Strider 'Sojourners', a title given to Striders that show an unquenchable thirst to explore, to go out into the wider Switchboard, treading old paths and forging new ones, hunting for powers (Teks and relics), new frontiers, points of interest etc. A vast majority of fairly elderly Striders will carry the title of Sojourner.

Titles themselves add to the nature of the Strider, in the form of Titular Powers, powers resembling Teks exclusive to those that bear the title. Strider Sojourners have the uncanny ability to enter places assumed impassable and escape from places thought inescapable, as well as proficiency with instruments that facilitate [[The Skywards Pursuit]].

What can become a Title is lacking in limitations. Often, a Title requires solely patterns of action and conviction of that pattern and of the action 

## Further Notes: A Definition of Terms
There are various terms used to describe the various kinds of people in the Switchboard in relation to their power in the Switchboard. Due to many of them being used somewhat haphazardly, it felt important to define some of the terms in use here.

- **Strider**; a wielder and user of the Strider Protocol.
- **Chalkstrider**; same as a Strider, but used when differentiating between Striders who use the **Strider Protocol** and Striders who use the **Depthstride**.
- **Weaver/Chalkweaver**; Someone who can use the **Weave Protocol**. They, however, **may not necessarily be able** to use the Strider Protocol. Most Fel-Arcad are Weavers. All **Chalkstriders** can use the Weave Protocol.
- **Depthstrider**; a Strider who uses the power of the Void to traverse the Sky, via Depthstriding.
- **Grounded**; someone incapable of using either the Weave Protocol, Strider Protocol or Depthstride.
