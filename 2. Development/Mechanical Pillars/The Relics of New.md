# The Relics of New
The Relics, Thy Mettle 2.0, updated with the new name, in-line with the fresh canon, and taking on the new name and lore of CARP - the Collaborative Artificial Relics Project.

## The Natural Relics
![[The Hands as Chalk#^abc506]]

Natural Relics in the Switchboard arise through the mechanics of spontaneous equations; chalk gathers and accumulates around something - a concept, object, something that can serve as a 'seed' for something grander - and it takes on patterns that grant it powers beyond its mundane nature.  ^a3de16

These patterns often are drawn from the surroundings or produced by the implements own weave (such as a sword producing the pattern for sharpness). While they lack the versatility and direction in purpose possessed by the artificial relics, their creation from the raw stuff of the Switchboard seeping into them over eons makes them immensely powerful. 

## The Artificial Relics
As a matter of necessity, the earliest Chalkstriders learned to make Artificial Relics. Originally this was done by simply letting mundane implements marinate in chalk-dense environments, but the practice was refined by the usage of rituals to fold patterns that produced the desired changes into mundane implements. The use of these early artificial relics was in casting more advanced rituals, combat and utility, and opposing the various problematic equations existing in the Switchboard.

As such, relics were a means to direct a Strider's power. Often, a Strider 'casts' their various powers with their relic in hand, serving as an inlet and outlet, a bridge between them and the Switchboard. With natural relics being too rare, artificial relics provided on-demand power for Striders in need.

### The Collaborative Artificial Rituals Project (CARP)
	This section delves into Switchboard canon.

It became a problem for the early Chalkstriders that in the making of artificial relics, they would have to subject them to an extensive list of rituals that were time-consuming, expensive and risky to perform. As they journeyed further into the Switchboard, they faced new challenges and needed to either create new tools or modify old ones to keep their arsenal up-to-date. The craft of creating relics became convoluted, overly fragmented and fraught with additional problems. It was agreed upon that a central body that coordinated and created a standardized model for all relics in the Switchboard would be optimal. 

This task was lain at the feet of the newly budding Academy, which plumbed through many iterations before finally reaching the **Collaborative Artificial Relics Project**, shortened to **CARP**. CARP was basically a collaborative of Striders dedicated to producing standardized ritual schema that when cast upon a mundane implement, would convert it to a '**CARP relic**' that would have immense power and versatility right from the get-go, usable immediately as a tool for tackling the various dangers and challenges of the Switchboard. 

As Striders traverse the Switchboard and encounter new frontiers and all that they bring, this information is taken back to the CARP and its subdivision's  development teams, analyzed and assessed, with conclusions drawn on how to improve the next iteration of the CARP ritual schema. As with any on-going collaborative endeavor, frequent checks are made to trim away accumulated fat and rot, keeping the entire project streamlined and potent.

Of particular note is the schema produced by the **Modular Offensives Division** under CARP, responsible for the creation of the Academy's weaponry used by their various actors, particularly their Operators. The '**MOD**' schema, as it's shortened to, confers mundane weaponry with considerable power and - most importantly - **modularity**, allowing individual Striders to 'mod' the resulting relic as they saw fit, ensuring it fills a niche no other could in their repertoire.

Each iteration of CARP and their subdivision's ritual schema would be denoted by 'AAAA-XXX' where 'AAAA' was the subdivision that handled the particular schema in question - or CARP themselves, and the 'XXX' being the 'iteration number' of the schema - how many versions of has passed since the initial. It became common for Academy Striders to make personal 'forks' of the root CARP ritual schema, often to make them more compatible with other powers the Strider possesses, or to grant it powers and capabilities either not yet implemented in the root schema or removed from newer iterations of it. These forks would typically be denoted by 'CARP-XXX-F#YYYY', the 'F#' (pronounced 'F Sharp') indicating the fork of the CARP or subdivision schema version mentioned, and the 'YYYY' being an alphanumeric string that refers to who crafted the fork.

	In the canon, the latest iteration of the MOD schema is #046, making all relics that use it have a preceeding denotation of 'MOD-046', followed by the relic's name. As a better example, Adven Ventura, the Strider-Sojourner wields a pair of relic revolvers bearing the denotation 'MOD-046-F#VEN4: Sojourner's Tale'.

### Relic Forging
The mundane component that becomes any kind of artificial relic benefits greatly from it's own construction and functionality as well, as many benefits added by the ritual applied primarily enhance the pre-existing nature of the subject implement. As a clarification, however, a ritual will not typically grant powers to a relics that are too far a stretch of the imagination for it to have.

A relic that is a sword or similar, will not gain the ability to function like a firearm, nor will a relic based on a firearm function as a sword. Striders craft their pre-relics to exacting specifications before imbuing them with the power of a ritual to complete them as relics.

As mentioned earlier, these relics benefit from their construction. The usage of high-quality materials and craftsmanship go a long way to improving the final relic product. More subjectively, the care put by a Strider in the crafting process and how well it relates to the Strider making it also affect the information tangible qualities of the relic, and serve to enhance its power and deepen the unity between it and the Strider that made it. 

## Prime Relics (PHldr.)
Prime Relics are a subdivision of natural relics, forming only under extreme circumstances. These circumstances vary, but in the canon so far, the only means of forming a Prime Relic are using a collapsed region's [[The Skywards Pursuit#The Gravity Axle |Gravity Axle]], or via a [[Chalk Ritualism#Structural Casting |Structural Cast]]. When wielded by a Strider, they read their lattice and refold themselves to be best suited to be wielded by that Strider and reflect the doctrine that guides them. Their power is unmatched in the ability to cause vast, sweeping change to the Switchboard.

## Further Notes
### Terminology
Differentiating between a **relic** and an **artifact**.
- **Relics** are used to describe calcic-enhanced **weaponry**. As a term, it's used almost exclusively to refer to calcic weaponry enhanced by means of weave or a ritual baked into it.
- **Artifacts** refer to nearly everything non-offensive or combative that has been enhanced by chalk.
