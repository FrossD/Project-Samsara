# The Skywards Pursuit
This document is all about the Switchboard Sky; how it serves as both a clock and a map and the tools used for deducing information from aforementioned sky.

Also should talk about what's out there in the Switchboard, and the general philosophy of launching out into an expansive deep. ^8eb955

## The Switchboard as a World
The Switchboard exists as a vast, deep, traversable, populated space, stretching the definitions of three dimensions, time and distance. Traversal through the Switchboard is done primarily and almost exclusively via the Strider Protocol, the pillar of Strider Ritualism guiding the act of traversal being the Skywards Pursuit; a Strider principle that governs the 'sky' and the means of 'pursuing' it.

The Skywards Pursuit is the Strider Ritualism of dwelling in and navigating the Switchboard. It concerns the nature and nuances of time, distance and location, traversal from one point to another via Strider Wayfinding, points of interest and importance in the Switchboard, the impassable void veils and the nature of stars.

## The Switchboard Sky
Striders as a whole see the Switchboard as a 'sky'; a limitless expanse stretching far beyond sight and comprehension. Standing in a region peering outwards, the Switchboard appears as an endless night sky, shifting colored gaseous hues, pinpricks of light peering through from distant stars, duller lights from regions appearing as diffused halos. A Strider's life is spent constantly observing this sky, learning how much of the Ritualism is bound to it.

This view of the Sky is deepened with further Stride. Moving through the Switchboard, Striders are able to see the Sky more clearly, their information-seeking eyes able to view the dynamics of the mechanism at work. Paths between regions, superhighways of information moving across the expanse like wind, the gentle yet momentous glow of Law Stars, beaten paths taken by other Striders between regions, dense pockets of inter-spatial void, and the distant glow of unexplored frontiers, right before hitting the mighty veils of void that cordon of sections of the Switchboard from the rest.

The Skywards Pursuit exists as recognition of the prominence of the 'Switchboard Sky' by virtue of it being the cradle in which all other things rest, and the expansiveness of it therein. The Skywards Pursuit is quite literally, the pursuit of the sky and all that it holds.

## The Grand Stellar Procession
The Grand Stellar Procession is a concept that describes the nature and behavior of stars in the Switchboard. The stars in the Switchboard are constructs, energy wells of pure information radiated outwards constantly, primarily absorbed by Switchboard regions to form Latent Chalk as outlined in [[The Hands as Chalk]].

Stars in the Switchboard fall under two categories; Law Stars and Regional Stars. Law Stars exist in the actual Switchboard space, and serve as the radiant sources of information as well as (somewhat) fixed nodes for navigation. Regional Stars are projected in the sky of a region via it's Regional Equation. While Regional Stars are typically used for telling time (Horological Stars), regions can add additional stars to their sky to mark things of certain significance.

Some regions elect to not have a star that serves as a 'sun', bound to a certain cycle that produces the phenomena of day and night.

## The Stacked Bubble-Wrap Model
The Switchboard structurally is best represented by many stacked layers of bubble wrap. A vast majority of the Switchboard is contained in each individual bubble known as 'Regions', the space between these bubbles being the Interspatial Void; the Challenger Dark.

Bubble Regions exist by nature of their Regional Equations; Chalk constructs that dictate the nature of the bubble region, controlling it's gravity, pressure, temperature, the nature of it's 'sky', all factors that ultimately decide the answers to mundane questions such as habitability and more esoteric questions often held only by Striders.

### Regional Models
The model of regions is similar to a conventional planet, consisting of a solid spheroid center, a layer of atmosphere, and - due to the nature of the Switchboard - a final layer viewable as a barrier or membrane, that serves to contain the contents of the region. This final layer is maintained both by the regional equation and the anchorage superstructure that connects a region to the Wellspring that birthed it and other neighboring structures.

### Regional Formation
Regions form primarily through the mechanics of Latent Chalk and Spontaneous Equations.

### Regional Equations
A regional equation is a complex engine that takes in raw Chalk, folds it, and produces a region. In actuality, it is a singular unit that consists of hundreds of smaller equations who's processes within themselves and interactions with others produces the properties of the region they govern.

All things you would typically associate with a planet - such as weather and climate, plate tectonics, ocean-to-land ratio, gravity, soil nature (such as acidity), mineral distribution in the crust, depth of the crust and all things under it, and more esoteric properties such as prevalence of Latent Chalk - are all controlled by the regional equation.

Speaking more on how, the regional equation is - as the name implies - a chalk equation, and as a result it serves to fold chalk to produce pattern and phenomena. The regional equation, being more accurately a collection of tens of thousands of equations that control every facet of what is by all metrics a planet-sized system, thus takes in chalk from Law Stars and folds that chalk into the material and mechanisms of that region.

Regional Equations also have a '**coefficient of evolution**'. Regional equations are formed from spontaneous equations that evolve over time, but their evolution continues even after the region reaches relative stability and maturity. This variable adds a degree of randomness to every single calculation undergone in the regional equation, producing subtle changes in the nature of the region, observable usually only if consciously tracked, or after long periods of time. The activities of Striders and external factors in the Switchboard can alter this coefficient, producing radical effects. 

Particularly skilled groups of Striders can concoct and execute a ritual that allows directly interfacing with a regional equation, and subsequently altering the entire region as they see fit. Expectedly, this is an immensely delicate task, with considerably dire ramifications when executed improperly. Why it's most commonly done, however, is to alter the region's sky, and regional stars.

**Case In Point**
It is common practice for Striders and chalk ritualists more specifically to modify their region's **sky** in particular. Regions in the Switchboard have two skies; a 'real' sky that is the result of the celestial bodies such as Law Stars, Wellsprings, other regions and other constructs both near and far relative to the region in question, and a secondary 'false' sky that is a region-wide projection crafted and projected by the regional equation. Altering the sky-generating regional equation is commonplace for ritualists on a region who use it to uphold the Switchboard tradition of inscribing a region's history in the form of marks on its sky.

Through the regional equation, skilled ritualists can 'draw' constellations or false celestial bodies or any other construct they choose, change the color of the sky, the day-night cycle and more. In particular, constructs placed in the sky are used to mark important dates in a region's history, such as the birth of noteworthy figures, the founding day of cities, the dates of great conflicts or discoveries and more. Damage to a regional equation is often reflected in its sky as well, in the form of region-spanning scarring, discoloration and more in its sky. 

### Regional Collapse 
The shape of a region is kept intact by the anchorage superstructures linked to it. These superstructure 'chains' link directly into the region's regional equation and connect to the regional equations of other nearby regions and wellsprings, acting to keep it stable and functional. When the superstructures collapse, the regional equations collapses in upon itself, and the region follows suit.

Regional equation collapse is less of a collapse in the sense of the pillars folding in and the roof falling down, but is more likened to decay. Once the supports are snapped, the equation gradually comes undone, patterns of woven chalk ribbon slowly beginning to unravel and fray. The result of this is natural disasters in the region; runaway climate, unstable plate tectonics and more. The last bit of the region to collapse is it's sky, it's stars winking out, replaced by the unfiltered sky of the Switchboard, light coming from distant Law Stars. 

At this, great cracks cascade across the region, fissures that split continent-sized landmasses, stretching down to the core. Unraveled chalk pushes at these landmasses from beneath, propelling them upwards and outwards away from the region's core, drifting into the Switchboard Sky. Regions decay by shattering, expelling chunks of themselves out into intra-regional space.

The last dregs of the regional equation collapse in upon itself, forming a core with immense leftover power; the gravity axle.

#### The Gravity Axle
A gravity axle is a dense core of woven chalk, containing the last dregs of a region's power. Before a region' collapse, the gravity axle is a singular wheel in the expansive gear-box of a regional equation, serving a function relating to the curvature induced by the information mass of the region. Upon collapse, it is the last thing left in the cadaverous shattered fields in the Sky.

Mere shards of them are highly coveted for the dense chalk contained within, but they are most valued for their usage in rituals, particularly those used by Striders in creating regions of their own.

### Regional Stars
Regional Stars differ from Law Stars in that they don't exist. Regional Stars are the product of a region's Regional Equation, and instead of being actual stars, are instead projections in the sky. Being projections, lensing effects lend them the illusion of immense distance, as well as their brightness. Their movement patterns are also dictated by the regional equation. 

Typically, regional stars function as clocks - just on a cosmological scale. The regional equation pulls Switchboard time from the Astrolabe Super-Region, and maps seconds, minutes, hours - even days, weeks and months - to the movement of stars in the sky. 

That said however, because they are projections, and because the Regional Equation is editable, it is not written in any law that regional stars must be use to tell Switchboard time, or time at all, or even create the phenomena of day-night cycles.

Some regions choose to have stars tell time since the inception of the region, rather than Switchboard time that counts from *t=0*; the dawn of the Switchboard. Additionally, regional stars can have their brightness controlled, a region with particularly dim stars may never have a 'day', instead existing in perpetual night. The speed at which they seeming orbit a region can be tuned too, meaning a region may have days longer or shorter than the typical twenty four hours.

Some stars are purely cosmetic. A region can assemble and deploy a constellation of stars that appear only on a significant day, acting as a cosmic tapestry relaying the sequence of events they describe. Singular stars can mark significant dates, such as births, deaths and discoveries. 

### The Regional Biomes Table
Regional equations produce a wide variety of biomes, and many other phenomena interfere with regional calculus to create biomes that evoke wonder and terror alike in those gifted the ability to traverse the Great Sky and see them. Below is a table of the various biomes in the Switchboard;

| 1 | **Snowy**                | Cold             | T1         | The snowed expanse exists covered in soft powder. It crunches lightly under the travelling boot, and obscures creatures with white pelts, who dart into burrows on approach, or stand briefly on hind legs to study the intruder who dares deserve the impermeability of the expansive white. The chill here is only light, giving shape to breath.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The Astrolabe spins, the Great Sky computes its grand mechanics, and still does the taiga persist, its trees seemingly unaware of the burning stars above. The chill here is accompanied by the smell of earthen wood, woven with the low grow of creatures that choose to wander rather than sleep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Ice crystallizes on the face, giving the traveler the appearance of some aged apparition of frost. It is this most unfortunate fact that the final traveler in a group long since dead believes his company still marches alongside them. Only when blackened fingers fall out of their gloves do they notice that the tundra's horizon remains unmarred by upright forms. The chill makes a home out of the bones. Only the hardiest life calls this its abode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 4 | **Spike Waste**          | Cold             | T2         | Blizzarding snow meanders through the solid ice spikes piercing the melding of sky and earth, the abandoned spear-tips of some great war, fought before there were scholars to record that it did. Snow hardens to abrasive furor, crunched wickedly under the boots of only the bravest explorers. Collapsing spikes kill many. The chill here feasts on the lungs, and a bare hand left lazily on the wicked ice will find itself disinclined to leave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The heat prickles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 10 | **Tar Fields**           | Hot              | T1         | Death takes form as liquid, as ancient deposits of slurried life buried deep below spout black and sticky to the surface. Oil mixes with sand, sucking in limbs with enraging nonchalance. The heat sticks and coats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Dry brown, dull yellow, grit that scorches the bare foot, vast emptiness, great open sky. The sun observes blinklessly. The heat drains, stings and cuts. Invisible hands steal both supply and resolve. They manifest only on sun-bleached bone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The crimson dust sears flesh that treads upon it. Spilled blood disappears without a trace. Red covers the ground. Red hangs in the air. Red burns in the sky above. Red burns in the eyes and rusted blades of travelers. The heat boils blood. The beasts born from the crimson swirls breathe dry wind like fire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Frequency and passion both intensified, and nothing was yielded. All that remains is char and ash, grey flakes that choke the lungs and darken the sky. Pillars of charcoal march in disordered testament. The heat here is dull, settling listlessly over bones in various poises of flight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Consume and grow fat. Grow wild. Revel in a youth that strangles and chokes all around it. Be cut. Be too large to care. Grow lost limbs ten fold. Cover. Encompass. Swarm. Become dense. Become impenetrable. Become wood that remains unchanging en masse, even as it life swarms within it in a million forms. Let the only constant be growth. Become wood that consumes all. Become wood that never stops growing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The air seeps from the boils on their flesh and finds its next meal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The doctrine here bites at all metal, it crumbles mercilessly into dust, coating the scape reds, ochres, sprinkled with green-blues. All are made pacifists as the methods of the violence-tongue rot. The air here stings as it crashes against skin, turning sour on the wetted tongue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 28 | **Irradiated**           | Toxic            | T3         | Flesh played a tutor, rock played the pupil. As flesh rot, it was fed upon by flesh that still lived, returned to the soil so that it may restore life to more things to come. But when rock rot, it unraveled itself, its weave seeking new homes in new things, things that were disinclined to entertain it. And as the rock rot and left its own bones behind, virulent weave took host in flesh, and what it didn't kill it changed. What it changed is what learned to live with rot in is flesh. The air finds its way into bone, and the bone mourns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 29 | **Nuclear Wasteland**    | Toxic            | T3         | An ancient altercation between power and power is recorded in lands scorched by the invisible. Basins carved into the landscape are a hazard to cross, the greenery long since turned brown lends no safety from the elements or food for the traveler. Yet the true horror lurks invisibly, a suffocating blanket of violent weave, seeking to pacify itself. Sometimes it succeeds, and bones lie skewed in agony as testament. The air here is a dance of knife and sword, flaying meat from bone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 30 | **Forgotten**            | Toxic Special    | T3         | No psychitect sculpts these brown, bogged, rotting wastes. They emerge instead as a region forgets. People, places, things, creeds, vows, dreams; all that vanish from the minds of their fabricators come here to die, taking on forms that skulk through lands draped in dilute ink and soaked parchment. Those who tread these lands face either forgetting themselves, or being forgotten. Or torn to pieces by those eager to be remembered. The air here reeks of old books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

From elementary mouths does solid and liquid emerald drip; the volatile viridite, cousin of famylar, that fills the matter of plant and beast alike, verdant-lime crystal overcoming their weave. The air is abuzz with viridite insect life, glinting green lights like flares, flying in geometric formation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Elders above, versed in the intricacies and aesthetic of the regional craft. Youth below, starry-eyed, cultivating their own eyes and hands. But some are so inclined to usurp that order; elders that feed on naïve young, young that topple the feeble old. Eyes seeing red, hands stained with red, the first works they sculpt are flesh and madness, and the result are swathes of a region resembling mangled corpses. The air here maddens, driving knives into backs.

| 33 | **Wastes**               | Grey             | T1         | In every conclave of psychitects are there the doers, the thinkers, and the thinker-doers. The thinkers vary in how they are perceived, as while many shape the theories that in turn shape regional sculpting for processions to come, among them are those who - for want of artistic talent - justify what they produce or lack thereof, by stressing the importance of the contemplation induced in spaces of vast emptiness. The horizon is unbroken, as empty sky meets emptier earth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 34 | **Badlands**             | Grey             | T1         | The amateur psychitect erases with hands that redact landscape from existence. But the skilled psychitect knows better. With chisels of wind and water do they carve out gulley and gorges, deep cuts in dirt and rock, variegated layers creating a sandwich of colors on the walls of great pits. Travelers be wary, as the grooved landscape hides those who prey on the unprepared. The horizon hides from view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 35 | **Steppe**               | Grey             | T1         | There is indeed hope for the great thinkers who concoct spiels on the deep nature of the Wastes; when, in their raving madness, do their eyes come to rest on a dislodged brush, brilliance forms in their minds like stars emerging from their cradles. A thin layer of green atop the empty grey prompts a new philosophy; that the deep thinking provoked by grating emptiness is aided by the smell of wet earth. The horizon remains unbroken, but for the light fuzz of young green shoots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 36 | **Mountainous**          | Grey             | T2         | The Strider exists as a mighty thing. Constrained only by their imagination and skill, the Strider weaves thought-stuff into stuff-stuff and traverses the gaps between more that drives them to imagine and the material expended in realizing it in an eyeblink. Few things humble the Strider. But when the regional calculus looks skywards, and a fist clasps around the fabric of rock, pulling as far as the calcic slide rules allow, topping it with dustings of snow like icing sugar, repeating this across an expanse that stretches deep beyond their sight and far past their periphery, visible even from intra-regional space, the Strider is reminded that they are a small thing that becomes, and a mountain is a large thing that simply is. The horizon is pierced to pieces by ice-capped stone pyramid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 37 | **Bio-industrial**        | Grey Special     | T2         | Psychitects shape the regional calculus, their hands painting on the canvas. But their canvas is home to many, and those untouched by the appreciation for the marble spheres that hang in the Cradles have no qualms when they build their chrome towers, vats of toxic brews, spires of crackling power. The calculus is tainted, the landscape likewise, and new life crawls from cracked waste barrels and clouds of metal-vapor, shaped by the carelessness of industry. The horizon here is obscured by smoke stacks, and often, one is knocked to pieces by the claw of a beast born from what remains when man has taken all he cares to learn he can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 38 | **Tabula Rasa**          | Grey Special     | T2         | There are times when the regional calculus breaks, the result being skewed creations of arcane mathematics. And there are times when the regional calculus resolves… into nothing, or rather something adjacent to it; a flat, empty, barrenness so grating in its nondescription that many argue there is no use for words where rulers would suffice. The horizon is parallel with the landscape, and explorers steer clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 39 | **Chromehaven**          | Grey Special     | T3         | The passage of many a traveler and the equipment they abandon leaves latent chalk skewed by the presence of thinking lattices. In response, the elementary Mindspun, proto-minds that once permeated the earliest starscapes of the Dancirah, emerge from thought-sinks and take form in abandoned metal. Their scraping forms learn the shape of their lattice, preserving knowledge of it as elementary thinking-weaves as they amalgamate into stained-chrome mega-construct. It learns swiftly of its own impurity, rectifying this gradually as it calls forth ore from deep in a region's core, watching in swelling hunger as metal overtakes the landscape, and its waking kin obtain shapes of their own. The horizon is dominated by bipedal silver-amalgam, yellow floodlights emerging from seams in the chrome plate. Wind carries their creaks and howls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 40 | **Automat**              | Grey Special     | T4         | The land here mourns. Torn, stripped of all resources, acrid air, pyroclastic flow, patrolled by chrome automata, sweeping the landscape with bright ruby cones of information-eating light. A rodent scurries over a rock, the disturbance answered with salvos of vaporizing beams, carving molten troughs in the blackened cobble. The horizon is obscured by dense ash cloud, above it, the faint glint of a distant Vault, housing the Mind that feasts on the works of the psychitects, warping the regional calculus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 41 | **Hazy**                 | Dark             | T1         | Spindly trees grow beyond what is allotted to them, and they bend as wives in mourning, vines draping like curtains in mimicry of freed hair. Between them, in this slumbering grove, does a mist permeate throughout, gossamer in make, wholly intangible. The traveler is convinced without reason that they are being followed, and the cruel psychitect completes their terror by giving them one. As in the obscuring haze does occasionally rattling chain resound, squawking and beating wings accompanying deathly chill that shakes the boughs of the weeping forest. Night here is respite for the dead, as only the foolish dare brave the mist in the pitch dark. And there are graves enough for all of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 42 | **Penumbra**             | Dark             | T2         | From afar, thick cloud cover seems constrained to a space without cause. From afar, deep purple-black woods hedge in a world unknown, the foliage carpet taking on a wine hue. But from within, the world exists in a quasi-night, where no light permeates the clouds but for wrathful light-flashes heralding a storm that never comes, granting terrifying shape to all things tall and spindly. Aqua and lime bioluminescent growth grants the dark world beacons for those treading the overgrown depths. All that lives here sees through the lightless thicket, as relentless bio-calculus has left only those who can. Night here takes only the form of silence, as all that caws and creaks recedes into yet deeper shadow, letting the true masters of the half-light stalk on retractable claw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 43 | **Midnight**             | Dark             | T2         | The young psychitect is tread upon by their peers. Their love goes unrequited. Their ancestor-kin are sympathetic, but do not understand. Their incandescent wrath has long since cooled into something greater; a deep black sea of cold oil. They paint on the regional canvas with this oil, taking the form of swathes of cascading black velvet, through which pinpricks of light poke through. Whether they be the brightest of stars or the hungriest of eyes, matters not. Night here is a closed hand around the neck; it swallows both air and scream.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 44 | **Nightmist**            | Dark Special     | T3         | Through the haze that lurks ever just above the head, the daring adventurer will begin to question themselves. Castle and inn, fence and fortress, the mist solidifies into ruins before him, only to dissolve again into the lightlessness at the slightest touch. Only incomprehensible lights remain ever solid and permanent, spheres floating on soundless winds. They beckon to follow, and to follow is to join their procession. Night here is all there is. The young adventurer finds their elder gone - and another light on their shoulder, joining the growing collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Their unlucky counterparts and contemporaries sleep on the seabed below.

But there are times when the wrath takes the shape of a bottle poured on the sky and the sea below, and cloud touches wave with torrential rain and glowing lightning. The water here breaks steel. The unprepared are sacrificed to keep the wrath pouring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 48 | **Neon Sea**             | Wet Special      | T3         | Psychitect orders pride themselves on their charge to shape regions. These glass spheres that hang in the Dancirah are the unending work of generations, with each returning to the Current leaving their instructions and philosophy on the sculpting of spheres behind for their successors. But times come when the old doctrines are left to gather dust, starry-eyed descendant-kin choosing instead to test the limits of their hands and eyes. The Neon Sea glows as a jewel in the crown of Shalkarah. Priscillite crystallizes and floats atop its surfaces. Deposits the size of their creator's dreams dot the sea floor. Their color morphs from piercing yellows to sweet pinks to sickly bright limes according to unknown calculus. The neon water tastes like sugar and fruit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

One such mundane factor is the expanse of ocean that dominates a region. Another such factor is the glowing rock beneath it, existing in permanent near-melting state from the pyroclastic flow beneath it. The result? An ocean that steams, smells entirely of cooking fish, and a weather system that defies understanding.

But to know it, to fully grasp all that it is and capable of, escapes all. The compute is guided by alphanumeric seeds of uncountable length, the sheer depth of variability exhausting lifetimes just to begin to grasp. And so when any psychitect is seen to be becoming too loud, too confident, too sure in their own conclusions, there is always a joker waiting to ask what their findings lead them to conclude is the cause of the chicken soup ocean in the Cannoodle Expanse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 51 | **Amarascar**            | Esoteric         | T3         | The Challenger Dark occupies the spatial fourth axis, and the foolhardy traveller is always at risk of slipping below the horizon, finding themselves gulping mouthfuls of sour stardrip. Regions are likewise similarly unlucky, and a great sphere caught in ravenous flux storm may find itself blemished. Stardrip soaks into its soil and foilage, clouds turn scintillating violet, reflected in deep magenta waters where amaranthite sprouts and grows as crystal spire, depthstones sliding in from seemingly behind curtains of sky, crashing to the scarred lands below as lilac meteors. The depthstrider comes here to pay homage to his Void-dwelling kin. Chalk is strangled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 52 | **Vermeil**              | Esoteric         | T3         | The Strider historian leans down to the scarlet grass, masked in the shadow of wine-red rock above him. A column - possibly - wider than his wingspan, that must've held up a roof capable of eclipsing the hue-shifted stars above. From the dirt does he pluck something red and sharp, flower cut from red gemstone. The field is filled with them. Light becomes redder through its kaleidoscopic petals. He peers deep and sees silver lines in the cut. He peers through the petal at the column. An ancestor stares back, mechanical, quadrupedal, its hands bear fingers that split and reform, bound to a spiral cylinder body with threads of light and chalk. Six eyes peer from concentric rings, rotating around a morphing gallium foci. It speaks. There was weave that thought and envied its form. It is weave that thinks and envies your form. The chain will not end with the Chalkstriders. The red horizon is pierced by the headstones of an old world. The chalk here is old, and warns you of things to come.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 53 | **Sunderlyles**          | Esoteric         | T3         | The endless question posed by all psychitects is that of the limits of the regional calculus. The answer to the question remains in flux, the boundaries pushed with each genius scholar or new seed fed by the Astrolabe. In proper academic practice, they all concede that they do not know. That does not stop the question from being asked, however, and so when a strider psychitect slingshots around a region, and sees the long, black shadow casted by an island, archipelago or continent vaulted kilometers in the air, held aloft by only calcic mathematics, they merely shake their head and remind themselves that the answer to that question is already known; none at all, whatsoever. Chalk here lurks just outside comprehension, and it mocks you as you reach for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 54 | **Shatterstorm Expanse** | Esoteric         | T4         | Hatred dwells in this place. Clouds stack themselves in stories and between their layers do flavors of storm surge. At their top do jaws lie, the Vitric Shelf peering down, ready to feast on the tornadic chalk. Instead it finds its scintillating teeth dislodged from its mouth, and they join the cacophony of swirling elements below. Chalk lurks below the jaws, this storm a daughter of the Refrain so many processions ago, when the Astrolabe sought to resolve its mathematics and tore sphere and Strider apart in its haste. Similar is taking place here, as a regional equation bends and buckles under the weight of ten textbooks of possibilities. Chalk and Glass swirl and dance as it does, new things attempting to arise just as old things are marked and culled. Often, the calculus resolves, and the storm gives way to families of craters and a region able to live another day, but just as often is no resolution reached, and the storm rages until the equation unwinds to mere ribbon, or a skilled-enough psychitect dares touch the angry calculus with a bare hand. Chalk here lashes out, Glass in its wake. All are humbled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 55 | **Supervoid**            | Esoteric         | T4         | A psychitect will tell you that a regional equation is above all else, strange. It is remarkably resilient, incredibly elastic, and this is tested time and time again by how fickle it is. Influence of any kind, from any source, and it is more than willing to test the limits of imagination in how it resolves itself. Hearing this, you may feel inclined to ask what occurs when a regional equation breaks. The answer to that is well-known, and will be readily given. You may then feel inclined to ask what is the step just before breaking; what does a region look when it stabilizes at the cliff? These questions weed out the younger psychitects, leaving only the old, who are less inclined for talking where pictures would suffice. These pictures, in turn, weed out those with very specific phobias; holes, cracks, spikes. A region at the edge bears all of these, resembling a scar that refuses to heal. Through some, you can peer to a shadowy depth, your view obstructed by constructs like ribs spanning the boundaries. Spikes protrude from some walls. Fissures span others. Something glows from behind hairline fractures. Landscapes stretch to the horizon, their surface seemingly molested by drills. You ask what lies at the bottom, and the elder psychitect only grins. Chalk here takes an unnerving edge, as you get a glimpse of what weave can become when given the opportunity to break. |
| 56 | **Thoughtgrave**         | Esoteric         | T4         | With nothing to protect, the Vault Mind's doctrine is unfulfilled, and the Mind itself collapses into the Current. With no Mind to keep it intact, the Vault collapses. Cracks and fissures cascade through the seams, mechanisms turn wild, ordnance and weaponry detonate. The last of its anchorage chains to celestial neighbors in the Dancirah come undone, and the Vault shatters, pieces of it pulled towards local regions. Skies remain alight for days as glowing orange kacherock - rich with chalk and lore - streak across the skies, crashing to sizzling stops and rests in blast craters. And this kacherock reaches out to the regional equation, its age meeting its youth, and mathematics resolves. The traveller comes to see trees and rock thousands of processions older than their neighbors, craters housing beating orange hearts, disoriented Chromelings carving incisions of tessellating hexagons into every surface. The air here is warm, and it comes apparent to those gifted in the calcic that they stand amidst a carcass. Chalk here lives on in new form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 57 | **Timelost**             | Esoteric Special | T5         | The kin of Vahn have always prided themselves as odd socks, hated stepsiblings, unashamed black sheep. A fist is clenched, and within it do the Vahnkin dwell, deeply bonded in all-encompassing darkness. The depths of Isalveh suits them, where treachery breaks all unlike them, and the void-kin are free to pick through the ruin of their sky-brethren in a strange sadism that sees them peering at the amaranth sky and laughing as yet another region slips through, caught in the clutches of a flux storm. None espouse this as deeply as the Void Drifters, those who peered at the final resting place of their patriarch, and emerged from it with the power to curve the Dark and the Dancirah in a manner that leaves the uninitiated in awe. The first display of this power is done with a region as their victim. The gentleman-strider removes his pocketwatch and finds its arms in stasis. He peers at the tap, water stopped mid-flow. A bird hangs in midflight. A paper hangs in the air, midway between a mounted thrower and a doorstep, at which his wife stands in mockery of a statuette. He takes a walk through a word that had inhaled and done no further, and above him, the only movement a receding violet light. Chalk here, weave here, stands on the edge of a cliff, unable to act.                                                                                                               |
| 58 | **Crystalline**           | Esoteric Special | T5         | The Dancirah once had no neighbor upstairs, but that was changed. Great intelligences deceived the Astrolabe, and the ever-oscillating barristeel contraption danced to the tune of their malicious ballad. The calculus synthesized an ontological antithesis, scintillating, kaleidoscopic, ravenously hungry for discord. The intelligences taught it to open its gaping maw, to take wide scything bites, to feed on chalk, lacerate weave, pull the seams from pattern, reduce thinking weave to ordered file cabinets. The Vitric Shelf overlooks the Dancirah, and in its mathematical apathy, it makes meal of unlucky regions.

And just as there are names, there are names above names. Zakurich of Aur, the Strider Psychitect, lived his days as a beloved of Shalkarah, and his long sojourns along the Dancirah are marked with his touch upon regions; shining gold forests, white-rock temples atop mountaintops, nights filled with curtains of dancing color, rivers of water that renewed the spirit of the Strider, the spirit to look skywards, starwards, onwards. The spirit to ask Shalkarah, King of Roads, to renew their wings and pave paths through the wilderness-sky.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The First Arcadia at Rosenthal remains an immortal dream carved in the lattice of every one of them, a paradise who's perfection only grows further deified as generation after generation of Fel-Arcad grow more distant and silver-haired. That does not stop the rare prodigy in each generation from making the regional calculus their dogma, in a bid to reshape lands back into barristeel-shaped perfection. All fall short. Failures compound. But these failures are lands where chalk surges forth, and the chalk ritualist finds the craft saturating the very air.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The lone, fool-hardy Strider feels the starblight eat into their legs, watching as the dark of interregional space fades away, heating building as they crash towards a region. The Astrolabe clicks forward again, and again, and the wrath of the stars screams further, until that wrath leaps out and licks a region. Chalk, wild and free, plays across the surface of the regional equation, tearing into it and repairing it all at once, the result being... Chalk here flows, elementary beings rise on new feet, see with new eyes, think with sharpened minds. The downed Strider rises to their feet. White surrounds them, glowing hot, nigh molten, pricking their lattice. Yet they feel no pain. They rise above the trees. They sink an inch above the ground. Nefelé smiles upon them.

Would Morrigan's wrath ever be sated? Would Shadri's books ever be full? Would Leilani's cup ever be empty? One such question pondered was on Ryjik, the Eater; where did all the Glass his jaws consumed go? No answer was forthcoming, but one; the many chromatic, rainbow regions, built of the kaleidoscopic scintillate - Glass with no bite or edge - that dotted various regions, emerging - seemingly - overnight. But only after the reserved Skydancer was seen cleaning his scarred lips with a sleeve.

## The Astrolabic Regions
Some regions, however, were formed by the Astrolabe itself. These are the **Astrolabic Regions**, characterized by having the physical structure of a typical planet-like region, while also having the chalk and information density of a Wellspring.

The nine astrolabic regions formed by the Astrolabe existed in a stately orbit around the Astrolabe that birthed them and continue to do so even long after the Refrain, where they were shattered beyond habitability. Chief among the astrolabic regions is **Spyndl**, from which the Third Kin arose in the Switchboard. Serving as both calculation apparatus used by the Astrolabe and homes for the first Chalkstriders, the astrolabic regions occupy a significant place in Switchboard history. Spyndl, from which they arose, is frequently referred to as the **Seat of Shalkarah**, to honor Shalkarah and the other Skydancers that fought for the Third Kin.

**The Astrolabic regions - including Spyndl - are**;

The Astrolabic Regions had immensely simple regional equations, resulting in their generation primarily as vast deserts of pure chalk, littered with structures resembling ruins, but were actually essential components for various calculations performed by the Astrolabe. Study of these fragments of calculation gave the earliest Chalkstriders information on their universe and the knowledge necessary to begin weaving chalk, and eventually learning how to use the Strider Protocol.

When the Refrain came and went, the regions were shattered, though not totally. While individual spheres retain a fair bit of distinction from each other, a ring of highly calcic debris exists around the Astrolabe of today. It has been designated by Striders as holy ground, an essential part of their history and beliefs. While visiting the Astrolabic Cradle where the Astrolabe and the broken region-ring sits, the immensely dense calcic activity and sacred nature of the grounds has many preferring to steer clear out of caution and reverence.

Each Strider can trace their lineage both to a progenitor family and the astrolabic region upon which they dwelt before the Refrain.

For now, the Astrolabic Cradle serves as the basis upon which the Switchboard's horology is built.

## Time and Horology
Time in the Switchboard is the product of the super regional chalk mega-construct known as the **Astrolabe**, manifesting as a complex cosmological clockwork mechanism who's dozens of oscillating an rotating measures keep record of a number of quantities, most particular being time since the inception of the Switchboard; 't=0'.

Early Striders encountered the Astrolabe and through study, they discovered its purpose and behavior. From studying it's measures they deduced their system of time, beginning from years down to what we call 'seconds'.

A 'year' in the Switchboard is known as a **procession**, and it denotes a **432 day passage of time**, as marked out by the Astrolabe. The 432 day procession is further divided into **three seasons**, each 144 days long, and defined by varying amounts of calcic activity as displayed by the Law Stars. The Astrolabe in its grand calculus is inexplicably linked to all the Law Stars in the Switchboard, and the resultant of this calculus produces seasons of low, medium and high calcic radiance from the Law Stars.

At the start of each procession is **Ast'Lumies**, a season of the relatively weakest calcic radiance from the Law Stars, presenting the lowest risk of Overwrite to travelling Striders. As such, Striders choose to make their longest jaunts at the beginning of the year. Time passes into **Ast'Encendyr**, the middle season, where the Astrolabe's calculus results in the stars of the Switchboard glowing brighter and more powerfully. Where they were first merely luminous, they become incandescent, and Striders are somewhat less inclined to make long trips during this period. The final season at the tail end of the astrolabic procession is **Ast'Conflara**, where the conflagration of the stars begin. They burn with raw calcic force, burning the lattices of all that dare come near. In this season, the roads - as frequently travelled paths in the Switchboard are called - become dangerous to less proficient Striders, and even skilled ones are compelled to be more wary than usual.

At the end of the procession, the Astrolabe resets its calculus and begins the seasonal cycle anew - **Lumies**, **Encendyr**, **Conflara** - in a phenomenon known as the **Radiance Cycle**.

>Perhaps a way to shorten these as used in Strider 'slang' would be 'Mies', 'Dyr' and 'Lara'.

> They sound an awful lot like names. I like the idea of graphical/symbolic representation of the seasons as people.

During the seasons, periods of **lulls** and **surges** are also observed, where expected radiance potency dips or swells beyond expected values, and these periods occur fairly randomly as the Astrolabe sees fit to induce due to its calculus. Periods of significant lull can provide windows of travel for Striders even during highly radiant seasons, while surges can forbid travel for a period as well.

>One of the results of the Radiance Cycle is that calcic beings surge in strength towards the end of a procession, but the relative 'strength' provided to these beings **scales inversely with the complexity of their lattices**. Simpler beings such as the [[The EPIT#The Mindspun|Mindspun]] thus see surges in their strength, while Striders will see far less considerable boons to their power, further adding to the danger of travel in the later seasons.

Each season in the Switchboard is then further subdivided according to the procession of the **astrolabic regions** around the Astrolabe. Each of the nine astrolabic regions exist in a halo dance around the Astrolabe, and as they orbit it, each spends a period of **sixteen days** at the '**apex**' of the Astrolabe (a way of imagining this is if the numbers on a clock face spun rather than the hands, the 'apex' would be the original position of '12'; at the top of the clock). These sixteen-day spans of planetary apex positioning are what give the **weeks** in the Switchboard, a season thus consisting of **nine**, **sixteen-day weeks**.

The nine weeks repeat themselves in every season, meaning each astrolabic region will spend sixteen days at the apex of the Astrolabe three times a year, once in each season. The melding of the name of the region and the season in question gives us the **names of the weeks** in the Switchboard, which aid greatly in relaying measures of time.

For example, 'Spyndl-in-Lumies' describes the first week in the procession calendar, with 'Spyndl-in-Encendyr' and 'Spyndl-in-Conflara' describing the tenth and nineteenth weeks respectively. Some phrases used to denote periods of times go along the lines of;

- "At the next apex of Rosenthal." is the next week bearing Rosenthal as its region.
- "That happened seven cycles ago." refers to the cyclical dance of the regions around the Astrolabe, and better translates to 'seven weeks (7x16) days ago'.
- "At the turn of Spyndl." translates to 'next season', as Spyndl, the seat of Shalkarah, begins every season in the Switchboard.

However, Striders frequently contract the names of the weeks for brevity. Contracting the names of the Astrolabic Regions, we get prefixes, which are appended to suffixes derived from the contraction of the names of the seasons - Lumies becoming '**mies**', Encendyr becoming '**cendyr**' and Conflara becoming '**flara**'. That allows us to construct a table of sorts;

| # | Name      | Contracted | In Lumies' (1) | In Encendyr' (2) | In Conflara' (3) |
|---|------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Spyndl     | Spyn        | Spyn'mies      | Spyn'cendyr      | Spyn'flara       |
| 2 | Aurica     | Aur         | Aur'mies       | Aur'cendyr       | Aur'flara        |
| 3 | Devahs     | Deh         | Deh'mies       | Deh'cendyr       | Deh'flara        |
| 4 | Leydin     | Ly          | Ly'mies        | Ly'cendyr        | Ly'flara         |
| 5 | Endelm     | End         | End'mies       | End'cendyr       | End'flara        |
| 6 | Rosenthal  | Os          | Os'mies        | Os'cendyr        | Os'flara         |
| 7 | Sanscrii   | San         | San'mies       | San'cendyr       | San'flara        |
| 8 | Cylindrica | Cyrc        | Cyrc'mies      | Cyrc'cendyr      | Cyrc'flara       |
| 9 | Wyntrar    | Wyn         | Wyn'mies       | Wyn'cendyr       | Wyn'flara        |


With a sixteen-day week also being called a cycle, Striders further break down weeks or cycles into hacycles (half-cycles; eight days), quarcycles (quarter-cycles; four days) and oc'cycles (eight-cycles; two days). The Switchboard week is often taken as four quarcycles of alternating periods of work and rest.
> Can be further shortened (maybe) into 'hacycs', 'quacycs', 'ocycs'.

Numerical measures of time follow the syntax of;
>'Day Between 1 and 16' / 'Region Number' , 'Season Number'

The ninth day in Ly'flara (or 'Leydin-in-Conflara') would be represented as '9/5,3'. Reading, it goes 'the ninth day of the fifth week of the third season'.
>The procession number follows with ':' following the seasonal number, resulting in a hypothetical 9/5,3:100. A transition between processions would see the date count as 15/9,3:100... 16/9,3:100... 1/1,1:101.

As a final note, the sexagesimal system of counting for seconds and minutes as well as the icosikaitetrahedral system of counting hours remain unchanged; sixty seconds make a minute, sixty minutes make an hour, and twenty four hours make a day in the Switchboard.

We can make a graph of the conversion of certain measures of time to others;

| # | Measure    | In Processions; | In Seasons | In Weeks; | In Days; |
|---|------------|-----------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Procession | 1               | 3          | 27        | 432      |
| 2 | Season     |                 | 1          | 9         | 144      |
| 3 | Week       |                 |            | 1         | 16       |
| 4 | Day        |                 |            |           | 1        |

## The Interspatial Void
Occupying a vast majority of the space in the Switchboard is the Interspatial Void. It helps to think of the Switchboard as the surface of a pond, and the Void as all that lurks beneath the water's surface - only in three dimensions. The Strider Protocol allows skating across the -water surface without delving in fully.

A Strider running out of momentum to skate over the surface, falls to the depths, entering the Challenger Dark; the Void proper. Depthstriders however, do not have this problem, due to the nature of their Stride allowing manipulating curvature. The curvature of the Void saps a regular Strider's momentum, the result of this being they fall below the 'surface' into the Challenger Dark. Depthstriders due to their ability to manipulate curvature, 'cancel out' the curvature of the Void with anti-curvature of their own creation, allowing smooth sailing through the void. 

The Interspatial Void exists with varying layers of curvature throughout the Switchboard, presenting an additional hazard to travelers. Striders must map routes through the interspatial regions with the least extreme curvature of the Void, and these maps must be updated regularly as the void shifts and morphs over time, the curvature becoming more pronounced in some areas and less so in others.

### The Veils
Veils are products of infinite curvature of the Void, such that all travel across them curves into the Void unavoidably, rendering them impossible for regular Striders and even Depthstriders to travel. They warp all momentum to nothing, and any attempting to traverse them is inescapably dragged into the Challenger Dark.

The Veils present an immense obstacle to travel in the Switchboard. They can be imagined as immense walls that cordon off sections of the Switchboard and the regions therein from each other. Floating curtains in three-dimensional space, the way around too long and the way through impossible. The most common method to pass a Veil is doing so in the Challenger Dark. Veils in the Switchboard correspond to points of immense treachery in the dark below, as the infinite pull of Veils means oddities from near and far (both within the Switchboard and the dark) are drawn and accumulate just below it. Passing the treacherous roads in the Challenger Dark and travelling a safe distance away allows reemerging on the other side of the Veil.

The most optimal way of crossing a Veil, however, is with a Void Drifter. Void Drifters can induce infinite anti-curvature to cancel out a Veil's infinite curvature, the resultant of this being zero, allowing safe passage through the Veil.

Because of the barrier presented by Veils and the relative rarity of Void Drifters, many regions in the Switchboard are resigned to their sectors, with little communication happening between sectors, effectively ensuring most regions remain isolationist.

#### The Curtains of the Dancirah
The Switchboard can be viewed as a large sphere, the Astrolabe at the center of it. Cutting this sphere along the x, y and z axis gives us eight **spherical wedges**, each containing an eight of all there is in the Switchboard. These wedges serve as top-level locational identifiers in the Switchboard, the Switchboard thus viewable as having eight grand regions or 'sectors' as they are most commonly referred to in other space-featuring media. These 'cuts' along the sphere, however, are the **Curtains**; colossal Veils of immense depth that divide up the Switchboard into these wedges. Any who come near are dragged to the Challenger Dark so forcefully that even the strongest Striders don't even survive the trip down, much less the terrors that await below in the deepest, darkest depths of Isalveh.

Only a Void Drifter is capable of crossing these Curtains safely - no Strider irrespective of caliber could even hope to try. They must instead enter the Challenger Dark and cross on that plane, before reemerging on the other side beyond the Curtain. As such, the Curtains act as hard walls between wedges or regions of the Switchboard, meaning Striders in one wedge are heavily isolated from the seven others - seven-eighths of the entire Switchboard.

A result of these oppressive walls is a restriction of the flow of information, trade goods and even migrating denizens of the Switchboard. The only way to cross is in the company of a Void Drifter - who are rare - or through overland trips in the Challenger Dark - which is dangerous. 

## The Stellar Wedges
The division of the Switchboard by the Curtains results in eight wedges, which serve as locational identifiers for places in the Switchboard. When giving a full 'address' of sorts at stellar scale, it begins with identifying the wedge, followed by the sub-wedge or 'slice', then the cradle, region, and then the individual handling of locational identifiers by regions takes over. But the wedge stands atop this all.

## The 'Super Regions'

	Name change applicable here.

The Switchboard can be thought of as a large engine with various components that facilitate its operation. These take the shape of large information constructs existing within the Switchboard, linked together by dense, complicated lattices of chalk. They devour massive amounts of information to fuel and to be computed by enormous equations, outputting pure change that shapes the Switchboard. These are the Super Regions.

Super Regions take on various shapes and sizes. Most are wholly inaccessible. Many are heavily defended by constructs created by the regions themselves. Each serve a purpose that if tampered with, affects the whole Switchboard. There is naturally incentive to do so, as each super region contains information in form of actual useful truth and raw harnessable power.

A major driver of the power of super regions is Information Tangibility and how it intersects with [[The Blank-Slate Mind]]. 'Knowing' grants power, and information that is not commonly known, but of which knowledge *of* is desired, grants much more power. The significance of the super regions is only elevated by the lack of concrete knowledge of their nature, and the fact that that lack of knowledge is being continuously pondered by Striders. This creates a feedback loop; the mysteries of the super regions prompt inquiry, and inquiry prompts further mystery, in which both mystery and inquiry generate power and prominence.

### Super Regions (List)
This list is heavily a work in progress.
	- The Astrolabe
	- The Panopticon
	- Various Super-Wellsprings ([[The Hands as Chalk]])
	- The Vault of Worldlines (tentative)

> Lots to be added here, as Super-Regions are a cool idea. So far, an idea is where Law Stars even come from. Is there a fixed number of them in the Switchboard? That isn't reflective of reality, as stars are being created in our universe all the time. This question prompts a section on cradles, star forming/birthing regions where most constructs lie.

**The Panopticon**
![[Glass#^6c845b]]

**The Astrolabe**
- Link to relevant section in the Dancirah's Dawn document.

## The Wellsprings
Stars are the source of all the raw chalk that flows through the Switchboard, but harnessing the direct information output of a star is nearly impossible, and attempting to do so is usually fatal. It can be imagined as trying to scoop a bucketful of water from a rapidly flowing river; there is every possibility you can be dragged in and swept away. For Striders it is similar; the overwhelming quantity of random information output by a star can overwrite a Strider's, functionally converting them to a blank notebook.

As a result, harnessing raw chalk is typically only done via the Wellsprings, regions immensely information dense, but with the chalk trapped in crystalline form rather than being output as rays. These Wellsprings are important for fueling Super Regions, seeding and providing anchorage to normal regions, and being a source of spontaneous equations for Striders. Most Teks evolve here, and are carried away by currents in the sky into the wider Switchboard, dissipated over large areas. Likewise the seeds that become new regions, and rarely, powerful relics.

Wellsprings are viewed by Striders as intermediaries between stars, the source of all existence, and existence itself, though due to the inaccessibility of stars, Striders tend to view the Wellsprings as 'givers of life' and the source of nearly all of their power.

Areas of the sky with a mighty star and a handful of Wellsprings frequently evolve chalk equations that distribute themselves across the Switchboard. These places are **Cradles**, the equivalent of proto-planetary dust discs from which planets typically form.

## Strider Wayfinding
Wayfinding is the core of the Skywards Pursuit pillar of Ritualism. Wayfinding is the art and methodology of charting and navigating the Switchboard, using the various tools and methods developed by Striders. All Striders eventually learn a decent amount of Wayfinding, built either through experience provided by continuous travel, or through formal instruction. The Wayfinding, being the method of determining 'where' to go and 'how' to get there, is naturally heavily intertwined with the Strider Protocol as it is the means of travel itself.

## Wayfinding Apparatus
Striders use a variety of apparatus in the process of Wayfinding. 

	Nearly everything here is open to name changes.

### The Sextant
Core to the principle of Wayfinding is the Sextant, an instrument designed and used for mapping paths and traversing across the Switchboard. It does so by determining the distances between the user and a Law Star, and Law Stars and other Law Stars. Sextants need to be adjusted based on the position of the Strider, as the same patch of Sky observed from two different locations appears differently. Thusly, Strider navigation involves calculations of where you currently are and where you will be next. 

Determining distance is essential as crossing distances requires burning Stride momentum, and how much a Strider has left determines how much farther that Strider can go.

### Void Spherometer
A device for measuring the curvature at and around a given point. It functions by sending out a ribbon of chalk at a given velocity and monitoring it's behavior; the time it takes before being pulled into the Void, how swiftly it was pulled in once it was within the pull, etc.

It is an essential component of travel as it allows anticipating and avoiding immensely curved pockets of Void, or navigating through where the curvature is least steep if passing through Void is absolutely unavoidable. It is particularly needed in detecting and avoiding Flux Storms - and often your only saving grace if you find yourself in the clutches of one.  

As the Void is linked with the Switchboard Sky above it, turbulence in the Sky is always a result of turbulence in the Challenger Dark below it.

### Astrolabic Timepiece 
A clock linked to the Astrolabe, providing accurate measure of Switchboard time. The Astral Clock works in tandem with the Sextant and other instruments in navigating parts of the Switchboard subject to time-bound patterns, such as cyclical weathers.

### Starcharts
More conventional means of navigation. Details of paths and movements of stars and storms, hazards, stops, details not captured by instruments, but recorded by Striders who have gone before. Most Starcharts are personalized, created by individual Striders for personal use or copied for redistribution. 

### Stream Guider
A device that guides Striders to Chalk Streams; great currents of raw information moving across the Switchboard according to constructs linked by mighty equations. Entering and 'riding' one of these streams allows preserving and occasionally recuperating some momentum, allowing Striders to go farther with ease. Some regions are 'downstream' from others, allowing easier travel from one to the other.

### Astro-Cartographer's Almanac
A combination multitool carried by Striders, containing all of the instruments above, in addition to other odds and ends collected and created by Striders. It is better to think of it less as an Almanac in a book form, and more as a very large Swiss army knife the size of a binder, with parts of it able to fold and contort in inconceivable ways, thanks to Chalk engineering. 

## The 'Weathers' of the Sky
The Switchboard Sky presents dynamic, treacherous challenges in the form of weather or celestial events.

### Flux Storms
The Challenger Dark and the Interspatial Void are linked. Turbulence in the Challenger Dark produces similar effects in the interspaces above. Extreme turbulence can produce Flux Storms in the Switchboard, regions of unpredictably shifting curvature of Void that rapidly sap away the momentum of Striders attempting to move through them, ending their stride and flinging them into the depths of the Challenger Dark.

Conventional wisdom declares that you never attempt to Stride through a Flux Storm, but some actively chase the as at their storm's eyes, the boundary between the Dark and the Sky is weakest, and a Strider may learn secrets from the Void without entering it.

### Calcic Streams
A periodic weather event featuring river-like movements of vast quantities of information across the Switchboard, dense enough to sweep along Striders caught in their flow. They occur typically when a super region begins another monumental calculation, beginning first with drawing immense quantities of Latent Chalk from various corners of the Switchboard, especially from the information-dense Crystal Regions. Usage of the Astral Clock and Procession Calendar allows ascertaining when these streams will pick up again.

It is also common for these streams to contain things of interest to Striders; Relics, Teks, rituals, information useful in other ways such as the locations of distant, uncharted regions. Striders are incentivized to tap from these streams, gaining useful bits as they do. Even if nothing particularly significant is acquired, drinking from the pure Chalk of a stream revitalizes Striders, keeping their information keen for ages afterwards.

### Stellar Processions
Occasionally, Law Stars in the Switchboard move. Constellations of them, regions linked to them by anchorage Chalk superstructures, simply move from a point in the Switchboard to another.

It is a point of major contention why it happens. The conclusion is that it is one of the many great secrets of the Switchboard, who's answers will forge something incomprehensible when found.

That aside, Stellar Processions being groups of stars on the move, presents an issue for those with Starcharts that marked paths and hazards based on their original locations. Old routes that required bubble-skating off certain regions cease to exist, and distances between points of interest shrink and widen. Some processions are seasonal, and simply an issue of using the seasonal Starcharts as necessary. Some processions are random however, and create work in charting new paths for Striders to use.

**"If Stars can move, how do you keep track of which is which?"**
Tracking Stars is done via two means: sequencing their pulse patterns, and following the trails they leave behind as they move. 

The first is that stars have a unique 'signature' that can be sequenced by monitoring the patterns in it's inconsistent rate of Chalk output. The star varies in the rate at which it outputs Chalk, such as five seconds of full (100%) output, thirteen seconds of 45% output, and nine seconds of 10% output, creating a sequence that looks something like **(5/100, 13/45, 9/10)**. 

The second is that stars as they move - much like how chalk leaves white streaks on a blackboard - they leave streaks in the Sky. These trails are pure Chalk lingering in place, and following them can lead right back to the Star. As an idea, it can be one of the sources of Malachite Streams across the sky, as the Star induces a current of Chalk radiating from it as it moves in a direction opposite to the one it is moving. A star moving from a previously unreachable region to a well explored one is similar to sand-filling a river to make a new path across, granting Striders a way into the new frontier. 

## The Vaults
The Vaults are an interesting oddity in the Great Sky, the Dancirah. Created by the Eradication Imperative and watched over by the Interdiction Collective, the Vaults served as a means to contain the wreckage and ruins of the Second Thinkers' civilization; the Vermeil. When the Third Thinkers waged their various successful campaigns against the Minds, they fled and took refuge in the Vaults to avoid extermination. The Slates wielded by Striders, however, proved formidable weapons against the Vaults, and Striders in endeavors known as '**Kache Krashing**' would breach a Vault's security and gain access to the ancient, wondrous things contained within. 

### Preamble
It is worth pointing out that there are two major kinds of Vaults when classified according to time period; these are the **Interdictory Vaults** and the **Emergent Vaults**.

Interdictory Vaults served and still do serve as the dumping ground of the remains of the Vermeil civilization, and the Minds and contents within are immensely old, the chalk matured having existed and soaked up the natures of the Switchboard for many processions. These Vaults are particularly treacherous to krash, as the Minds within have been fighting Striders for longer than most. They also contain the most valued rewards; bits from the Vermeil civilization, ancient Teks and secrets, valuable [[Switchboard Technology#^09d274|hexic kacherock]] and more.

The Emergent Vaults began to manifest sometime after the dawn of the Chalkstrider Era.

**The Emergent Intelligences**
![[The Hands as Chalk#^33b0d3]]

**The Emergent Vault Minds**
![[The Dawn of the Dancirah#^bd86a4]]

The Emergent Vaults and Vault Minds thus containing objects of interest in much more recent memory; a legendary Strider is buried with their equipment, the region they are on decays and shatters, and all their relics are scattered across the Dancirah. As they float through inter-regional space, elementary intelligence forms from it, and it is charged to protect it at all costs. Around it, a mega construct emerges; a Vault designed to protect both it and the emergent Vault Mind.

While these Vaults don't frequently yield rewards made powerful by their age and source, they are still worth plundering, as a way of recovering the lost powers of a couple generations prior.

While Interdictory and Emergent Vaults share key differences, the Minds presiding over each are collectively known as 'Vault Minds', with distinctions only being made when trying to deduce the potential threat and rewards of a prospective kache krash.

### Anatomy of a Vault
Vaults are physical, three-dimensional constructs existing in inter-regional space. Though they very immensely in shape and size, they typically take the shape of an irregular three-dimensional solid (such as a tetrahedron but skewed). Almost always are Vaults shielded, and entry is only possible by disabling the shield. Entry into the Vault itself is done through purpose-built entrances or structural imperfections such as cracks in boundary walls.

Where Vaults vary immensely is upon entry. Vaults at their very elementary are labyrinthine, consisting of three-dimensional mazes of rooms and corridors and very many dead-ends. Employment of the y-axis in Vaults (verticality) results in these labyrinths presenting an immense spatial challenge to all entrants, with navigation ultimately being an immense ordeal. As though the labyrinths were not challenge enough, traversal through them is not unimpeded, as prospective vault-raiders will find themselves contending almost immediately with the **Vault Mind**.

### Encountering the Vault Mind
Be it First Thinker or newly emerged, all Vault Minds are calcic intelligences, given rise to by the various mechanics of the Switchboard. The Vault Minds differentiate themselves from other calcic intelligences primarily through doctrine; all Vault Minds emerge with a **prime directive** - that of **protection**. Protection of 'something', often what caused them to arise in the first place. This manifests as the creation of massive constructs that occupy the Great Sky - known as Vaults - the Vault Mind within tasked with protecting the Vault and preserving what lies in it. This it does with a litany of mundane and esoteric weaponry and countermeasures, ranging from its army of autonomous robots known as Chromelings, elementary projectile weapons, all the way up to caedometric weapons designed to lacerate lattices and doctrinal weapons that wage war with a Strider's very core.

The core conflict between Striders and Vault Minds is waged at the doctrinal level. Vault Minds seek to protect and preserve, while Striders seek to plunder. With nothing to protect, the Vault Mind fails to uphold its doctrine, and ceases to exist as a result. As such, just as Striders will use everything in their arsenal to break into Vaults, the Vault Minds within will employ every tactic they possess to frustrate their efforts.

Vault Minds fight for their own kind of survival, and they do so by taking all manners of measures - including communicating with other Vault Minds and direct attacks on Strider interests - to ensure that continued survival.

### 'Kache-Krashing'
Opposing a Vault Mind is done using the **Slates** and the [[Switchboard Technology#The Breach Protocol |Breach Protocol]]. The elementary sequence of breaching any Vault is three-fold; breaching the Glasswall, disabling its shield, and destroying its external defenses.

Once these are performed, physical entry into the Vault can be secured. Once a team has entered the Vault, it is then a race between the team's Glassbreakers and the Vault Mind. Slates are used to blunt and counter the Vault's many defenses, divine paths through the labyrinth, and secure additional edge for the team of kache-krashers along the way.

The final reward of a Vault is defended by the Vault's strongest defenses and the avatar of the Vault Mind, heavily armored against all manners of offense and bristling with weapons. Most dangerous however, is how Vault Minds maintain the final chamber - where the object of the Vault's security is kept - locked and inaccessible; using a Structural Cast that serves as a sort of elaborate combination lock. This 'lock' must be 'picked' by the krashing team weaving themselves into the ritual and defusing it by exploiting vulnerabilities or using any other methods at their disposal. However, it must be done without triggering a 'fail state' (similar to how actual Vaults can detect their internals being tampered with and set off alarms).

Failing to defeat a Vault Mind and defusing the Structural Cast under the terms set by both triggers the equivalent of a phenomena in MMO games commonly described as a 'wipe'. The cast resolves itself along parameters established by the Vault Mind, and the vault krashers are unraveled at the lattice level - before they are then purged from the Vault into inter-regional space outside. The resolution of the cast reactivates the Vault's shields and various defenses - 'resetting' it, almost.

Particularly tenacious Striders may feel inclined to attempt breaching the Vault again, and there is even an argument for doing so as knowledge of the Vault gleaned from the first run is invaluable for a hypothetical second go. However, Vault Minds obey similar logic, and will be prepared for a repeat raid by the same team. Particularly powerful Vault Minds may passively 'scan' and simulate the lattice of a krashing team, and use it to concoct an ontological weapon, capable of obliterating a Strider in mere seconds upon entry. Of note is that a Vault Mind would also have learned of the various tools employed by the Breach Protocol to gain entry, and will thus devise defenses against them to frustrate future raiding efforts.

> As such, when a Krash Operation (or KrashOp) is failed, the same team typically admits the defeat, marks the Vault as 'hot' for other potential teams, provides or sells information to interested parties, and ultimately moves on.

### Plunder
What are the rewards for successfully defeating a Vault Mind, defusing the cast in place, and accessing the final chamber?

Without even reaching the final chamber, dwelling in a Vault and drinking of its ancient chalk and the secrets it holds seeks to 'mature' the the lattice of a Strider, empowering all calcic powers they are capable of. Studying the architecture and murals of the Vault provides information about the early Switchboard and Chalkstriders, other oddities in the Switchboard etc. Destroying the Vault's defenses yields useful technology that can be reverse-engineered for a Strider's purposes.

The actual treasures of the Vaults as contained in the final chamber are far greater and more tangible than these however; ancient knowledge and technology utilized by the Vermeil, slightly less ancient teks and relics wielded by old Chalkstriders, powerful ritual schema, maps to lost frontiers, tomes of knowledge and secrecy, and far more. Vault rewards almost always justify the ordeal of securing them, and infamous Striders are often skilled and practiced Kache Krashers. 

## 'The Edge of the Switchboard'
A question asked among Striders is whether the Switchboard has an end, a supposed 'edge', and if so, what lies at - or beyond - it.

One school of thought is that at what would be the end of the Switchboard lies Veil so dense not even Void Drifters can cross it. It corresponds with an infinite sea in the Challenger Dark, un-traversable by any means. No Strider can move fast enough to escape the dense void, and no void drifter can chart the seas of void without inevitably being swallowed up by them.

Another school of thought is that the Switchboard is turned ('warped') upon itself, such that reaching one edge simply results in emerging on the opposite side of the Switchboard, once more heading back towards its center.

Yet another is that the edge cannot be reached at all, that the more distance is covered, the more distance must be covered, stretching impossibly outwards.

Some schools of thought, however, believe in something being out there.

Some entertain the idea that what lies at the edge, by virtue of Information Tangibility, is a secret that when revealed, kills the Strider that witnesses it. This naturally makes what lies at the edge impossible to know.

Some imagine the edge to contain all knowledge of all things. That at the edge, a Strider is able to gaze inwards, and their sight and mind is able to take up all of the Switchboard, granting them power beyond all comprehension.

Some think nothing at all lies at the edge, that it is merely a wall of Glass that information cannot pass through.

Smaller theories exist naturally, but ultimately, all are speculation, and all attempts to get a concrete answer have failed. One theory tangentially related to the edge of the Switchboard, is that the Mystics either discovered what lay at it, or a means to get there, and this information is what drove them to their unique insanity.
