## 1. Truth and Probability

In the Switchboard, information is power. What do we mean by information?

Switchboard information referes specifically to two prongs: the quantity of knowledge possessed, simply called "Knowledge", and the quality of the information possessed, simple called "Power".  In other words, in the Switchboard, Knowledge is *not* Power.

One may possess a library filled with books, each book containing a sequences of random digits. Qualitatively, we recognize that this is a lot of knowledge, but not a lot of power. The quality of information is low. But this is merely a heuristic assessment. How do we formalize the definition of "information quality"?

The actuality is, the quality of knowledge is determined by the question one wishes to ask. If you want to know the composition of quartz, and I have a piece of iron in my hands, that iron is not powerful. *Why*? Let's be specific.

The answer is that the piece of iron is not *well-correlated* with the question we ask. The correlation of information with questions is what gives that information power.

We can go yet deeper.

We live in a world of physics. The world around us consists of things that we can feel, touch, see, hear, *interact* with via some means. Now, it's true that there are some things we cannot perceive *directly*. But all things that "exist", in any meaningful sense of the word, are connected by some chain of interaction. If you can't perceive a thing directly, then that thing interacts with a thing that interacts with... etc., until somewhere down the line it is directly perceptible by an observer.

In that sense, there is nothing in the universe that has *zero* correlation with any other thing in the universe. It is always possible to construct a chain of interactions whereby one thing is correlated with another thing. So while a piece of iron is not *as* valuable to the question "what is the composition of quartz", it still possesses some nonzero value. It is still correlated in some small (though perhaps infinitesimal) way to the question we seek to ask.

By this principle, all things are correlated (in various degrees) to all other things.

The power of the Bayesian-slate mind is to extract these correlations, to make the most efficient use of correlations to answer questions. The mind is an engine, and the fuel for that engine is information. The power of a piece of information - the quality of that information, aka the degree to which it is correlated to a question - determines how well that fuel burns in the engine.

The direct answer to a question is a powerful piece of fuel. If you simply *know* the composition of quartz, that is valuable to the question being asked; it is extremely well-correlated with the question.

But - and this is the real secret - fuel is nothing without an efficient engine to run it.

The degree to which a mind can make *use* of correlations is that mind's Bayesianity. Perceiving the structure that connects information to question, that dictates correlations, requires both an unbiased blank-slate as well as efficiency in processing the information.

In particular, perceiving correlations *where there are none* is an immense deficit to a Strider. Recall that *certainty* conveys no useful power if that certain is based on faulty reasoning.

To modify a statement made in Post BS1-Notes: The amount of information a person possesses allows them to make better guesses, but only in as much as
 - that information is correlated to the question being asked, and
 - that person can use that information efficiently.
The efficiency of using information to make predictions is called "Bayesianity". It is the art of seeing patterns *if and only if* a pattern is actually there, if and only if a correlation exists.

As a fun thought experiment, consider different degrees of Bayesianity: different efficiencies of the mind engine.

A completely broken engine would be a combination of seeing strong correlations where there are weak ones, and seeing weak correlations where there are strong ones. An example might be a person who believes that a piece of calcite is a piece of quartz. They incorrectly correlate the material that they have in hand with the question they seek to ask.

A simple engine - more uncluttered, closer to the Blank-Slate mind - is one that can identify and distinquish quartz from calcite from glass from plastic; a mind that can, at least to a degree, perceive the strength of correlations correctly. In answering the question "what is the composition of quartz", they at least recognize what materials are more closely relevant to that question.

A masterful engine - one that approaches the godtier of the Bayesian-Slate mind - is a mind that begins to make use of even the smallest correlations to answer questions. In the hands of a truly Bayesian engine, a piece of iron *can* become powerful relative to the question "what is the composition of quartz". How? Well... iron is made from iron atoms. Iron atoms are made from protons, neutrons, electrons. Perceiving the part within the whole, one can determine the behavior of these subatomic particles by observing the behavior of the iron they make up. By then knowing the behavior of the part - and further recognizing that, deep down enough, *the part of iron is the same as the part of quartz* - one could then, in principle, deduce the structure and composition of quartz by knowing the behavior of protons, neutrons, and electrons.

## How this affects the Strider

This is a short section, but an important one.

The purity of the mind engine - the efficiency with which it runs, its Bayesianity - is directly reflected in the personhood of the Strider themselves. It is not simply a matter of the knowledge that a Strider possesses, or even the quality of information (the power) that they possess. 

The purity of a Strider's being is not just determined by their beliefs, but by *how efficiently they come to their beliefs in general*. A Strider may therefore be "polluted" by ideologies, philosophies, by applying patterns of reason and thought to cases these patterns don't cover. This is just as dangerous - if not moreso - than being overwritten by random information.

On the flipside, Striders that are closer to the godtier, fully Bayesian engine are *more* affected by the information they possess, because the perceive greater connections within it. They are more prone to being changed by knowledge they witness, by correlations they make. The more efficient the mind, the more useful correlations become, and the greater weight they bear on the person who perceives them. Dangerous information - infohazards - are therefore *more* dangerous to a more Bayesian engine than a less Bayesian one.
