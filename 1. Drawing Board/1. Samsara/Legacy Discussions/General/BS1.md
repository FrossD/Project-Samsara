# Brainstorming Session #1: Depthstrider Combat
## A Foreword
Good day, let's get down to business. 

We're doing a wet run of a 'Samsara Brainstorming Session' in which we all get together and spitball some concepts I need more ideas on, to develop something that will be slotted in one of the dozens of documents I am constantly working on. 

The idea is that it is a relatively free discussion but with a stringent insistence on the direction of the conversation. Tangents of discussion that aren't justifiable, will not be entertained. Allow me to outline a hypothetical success scenario for one of these sessions;

1. We get more than two people to participate, excluding me.
2. The discussion last between half an hour and a full hour.
3. I leave with a considerably larger pool of ideas than I began with.

With that said, let's get into the information we'll be working with as the baseline.

## The Ins and Outs of Things
### General Relativity
To begin this discussion we will all need a beginner's level of knowledge on Einstein's Theory of Relativity. I will attempt to explain only the parts most relevant to this discussion topic, and hopefully I will not say anything too egregious that might result in my obliteration at the hands of the good doctor. 

General Relativity explains the existence of gravity, and how gravity - rather than being a force - is instead a product of the geometrical (read, shape) properties of four dimensional space time. That is word salad. Let's use an analogy that you've probably heard of before. 

Suppose I had a large sheet of cloth suspended by four clips fastened to four poles all standing at equal distances from each other, such that the cloth is square and pulled taut as to be perfectly flat. If I then got a remote-controlled toy car, placed it on the cloth, and pressed the button that drives it forward, it will do so in a straight line from one edge of the cloth to another without much issue.

Suppose then I put a particularly large spherical object on the cloth at its center - such as a bowling ball - such that a great depression is formed in it, sloping down and towards the bowling ball in all directions. If I repeat the exercise with the RC car again, and pass too near the depression caused by the bowling ball, it is very likely that the car will lose it's grip on the cloth and fall in and towards the bowling ball.

This is a demonstration of gravity on the two-dimensional plane. Gravity is a product of objects of immense mass creating depressions on the fabric of space-time, only in three dimensions, causing objects to be seemingly 'attracted' towards them. 

We are looking at a very specific part of this phenomena in our discussion of Void Strider combat, and that is the **induced curvature**; the curvature of space-time caused by immensely high mass objects.

### Curvature and Anti-Curvature
Void Striders posses the unique ability to induce localized events of curvature and anti-curvature. Effectively, by pulling on the fabric of space-time, they warp it, causing objects in the vicinity to either be drawn to the point, or accelerated rapidly away from it. They do this using information and anti-information, which when tightly packed into minute points accumulate immense density and anti-density, which as a extension produce mass and anti-mass.

Do not worry yourself about what the in-universe explanation for anti-information even is. I don't even have an answer, and neither does the good doctor and they breathe physics. Let's move on.

The result of the creation of curvature and anti-curvature at localized points allows Void Striders to induce gravity and anti-gravity. The question then is how can this be used to fight. Some things are obvious; with immense gravity I can pull you in any direction I so choose, and with anti-gravity I can flatten you beyond redemption. But I know it can be so much more, and that is where you all come in.

As a baseline, a way to imagine it is if you can create points in space, some that pull things towards them, and some that push things away. You can adjust their intensity, position, flip their roles on the fly. We are making the capabilities and the limits alongside each other; the boundaries this power cannot exceed are ours to decide.


## Conversation Guide
**Aim:** 
1. Having a discussion on Void Strider combat methods.
2. How curvature manipulation - and by extension - gravity manipulation would be useful in combat.
3. More esoteric applications of localized curvature.
4. Theoretical and practical limits on the powers of Void Striders. 

**'Pointers':**
1. What is understood by 'gravity manipulation'.
2. Examples of gravity manipulation in other media (films, comics, manga, anime, etc.)
	1. In what ways they were used.
	2. What limits on them existed.
	3. If the wielders were defeated, how and using what.

## "When is this all happening?"
**Thursday October 20th**. An exact time will be deliberated upon by and communicated later. Until then, I encourage people to source material that might be relevant to the discussion.

## Closing Remarks
Thank you very much for your interest so far. If this goes well, it is something we can repeat again and again, and will be very productive for both I and all of you. Thanks again in advance.
