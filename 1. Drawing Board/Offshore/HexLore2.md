**Poem 3**
Whispers floated through the air
of a cave found in the woods.
A skull-shaped stone lay within, it was said
and that rumor had drawn Rurik there.

Few had heard these murmurs
fewer still who’d check their truth
So Rurik traveled by himself
Into the forest’s verdure

He ventured under leafy growth,
over boulder and through stream.
And then, through thicket of dense trees
he found the maw that led below.

A headlamp lit his way inside,
and with dexterity and strength
he climbed the heights and leapt the lengths
Until a chamber opened wide

From high above, weak sunlight shone
down upon a towering oak
And there, half-buried, just as hoped
among the grass was blueish stone.

Yet things were not the way he’d thought
for as he grasped the skull in palm,
he found its surface felt too warm,
and frowned - “Rocks shouldn’t be this hot…”

**Poem 4**
The world the witch awoke in 
was not what they remembered.
Had centuries gone by?
Or had their magic rendered
some law of reality broken?

All the animals and plants
looked as they had before
and went by the same names.
Sol and Lune rose on familiar shores
and maintained their yearly dance.

Yet in the world, and in their veins
no magic could be found
Stripped of all their sorcery,
the fabric of their core unwound
to leave behind just the mundane.

And so the demon vowed,
upon their very soul and mind
that they would seek the secrets,
learn the lore,
Someway, somehow, they’d find
a way to vanquish paralytic doubt
and rise 
even greater than before.
