# Hex's Lore Review: Itr.3
Here we go.

## Part One
### Section #1 - Poem 1 (Blue Typeface)
This was an interesting read, and it takes me back quite a bit. I'm gonna do something slightly unorthodox, in that I will pull you around by the hand a bit before we finally get to the point.

In what you all would call Grade 5, I was generally regarded at the most competent at all things English language. Literature, prose, speaking, and even dreaded poetry, it was agreed upon that there was a hierarchy and I stood atop it. Boasting aside, let me discuss what poetry was to me in that context. Most of what I'd read at that time was prose and comic books. I loved comics. Poetry was novel, unorthodox, very dissimilar to what I was used to. It has to rhyme? Why all the line breaks? It was all rather strange, but I took to it rather quickly once I realized that it had a fair bit of structure and rules to it. Kinds, rhyming patterns, using less to say more, the like. And so I got fairly good at it, and as I did, I began to swiftly dislike the medium.

My original approach was to focus heavily on producing what you could describe as 'by the book' poetry. Simple rhyming structures, 'aabb', 'abab', both of those with a 'c' rhyme at the end if I really felt like throwing the teacher grading it for a spin. I soon realized that the easiest path to success was adopting some rules of my own in its making. I took a fairly mathematical approach to it; do an 'abab' or 'aabb' rhyming structure, necessitating four lines per stanza, then do some number that 'meshed' well with four for the number of stanzas, like four again. Four lines per stanza, four stanzas. Sixteen lines. Sixteen was a good number. Sixteen feels like a jenga tower before the game begins, or a neatly folded drawer of clothes.

My teachers agreed. Mine was lauded as inarguably the best they had seen in all their time teaching. I was rather chuffed. I had streamlined the process without compromising on results. I think realizing what I was doing would never work in prose is what made me dislike poetry even further. As streamlined as my process was, there was still the difficulty of finding words that rhymed, giving lines the right amount of cadence; stuff that still took effort. Prose, I felt, was easier while still having more impact.

And then we were introduced to freeform poems.

I don't recall what I felt in that moment. Possibly awe, awe that became indignation, then maybe outright anger. I doubt I had that complex an emotional spectrum as a kid in grade 5. But knowing myself, I think I was immensely floored by the realization that playing aggressively by the rules was just as much a kind of poetry as forgoing them entirely.

It was baffling, but it was also exactly what I needed, because I then asked the very dangerous question of 'how bad can I bullshit this and get away with it?' It turned out quite a fair bit. I wrote my first 'free form' poem - really just words chewed up and spat out - and again, plenty of applause. 

Splendid.

Optimizing the bullshit was simple then. I didn't need to rhyme, or count lines and made sure they measured up, or care so stringently about cadence or really anything. I created a most devious workflow; write out literal prose, rewrite it with line breaks in the moments where I felt the cadence was right, establish some immediately obvious gimmick, and then deleted a couple of words to bring down the readability of the entire thing, to create the illusion of using less words to say the same thing or more. It proved hilariously effective. 

Watch, I'll do it right now;

> A man awoke to the sound of knocks on a window. Rising from where he stood to investigate, he discovered a shadowy figure that would later tell he was there to take away the man's son. Raising his trusty rifle, the man took two shots, putting the intruder well out of commission.

> A tap, a tap
> From somewhere near
> Did a young man hear
> 
> Up he arose
> to search, to search
> lest the wicked have their way
> his eyes came to rest
> a shadow, a shadow
> doing the Devil's work
> it had come to take
> his dearest, dearest
> 
> a shot, a shot!
> fast and true
> split the calmest night
> a shout, a scream
> another magazine
> and the intruder flew from sight

I will concede this isn't a perfect example of forgoing the rules entirely, but this is also the first poem I've written since 2019 to the best of my knowledge. I'm rather rusty at bullshitting, as it were. Now I just give it my all. A damn shame. 

Here's another example of one that better fits the 'freeform' designation, titled 'New World';

>Watch now, as the last green thing dies  
Ash left in its wake  
Not of fire, burning with wrath  
But of pride, burning with knowledge  
  
>A man in a coat raises a flask  
A New World cometh, his voice says  
one of neon splendor  
and architectural wonder  
That those before only foresaw  
in narcotic visions and holy books  
We shall build towers of silver  
and glittering streets of glass  
And how we shall, he says  
Lies in this empty flask  
  
>And valiant man charged to the stars  
returning to cities of cells  
Towering silver spires  
empathy locked inside them  
Arranged in a matrix  
The streets between them  
Glittering with puddled rain  
  
>And a woman in green satin watches from below  
Heap after heap of dirt flung on her  
Rasping between her wicked sneers  
And the man in a coat flings sweat from his brow  
the fear not following, for his fear is his knowledge  
Your end has come, he says  
none shall remember the Old World  
of grass and crystal water  
But the woman in green satin only laughs  
A cackling sound of unholy terror  
Blood staining her teeth  
Bury me shallow, she says  
Iâ€™ll be back

As an aside, I am viscerally harmed by being forced to relive these old works. 

In which we arrive at the point; this poem reads - and I put this as politely as I can - similar to how I used to bullshit poetry back in the fifth grade. 

>It was by accident
indeed the witch merely stumbled
into an idea of actual power.
What they realized
was that magic could be used
to carry out computations.

Let your brain close the line breaks and fill in some punctuation and conjunctions. I could just as easily write it out, but I'd rather if you saw what I saw for yourself. Your poetry reads too much like someone dropped some prose, watched it break, then hastily put it back together with super glue.

And this is probably a comment on freeform poetry in general. 

Perhaps one of the most common 'compliments' we give to people we are socially obligated to not be deadass with (think kids and people starting new hobbies) is that what they've produced is 'unique'. I don't know how familiar with this particularly niche occurrence, but growing up in churches and the like has put me in this situation numerous times; a child does arts and crafts, often macaroni stuck to a paper plate to make a face or a lump of playdough that vaguely resembles something Lovecraft would dream up, and because their little brains love the stuff they come up to you for validation, that the thing in their hands is just as cool to you as it is to them. And it simply isn't true. You simply do not like what is being presented to you as 'art' because it does not appeal to your senses the way an oil painting or a 3D animation or a good book does. And that's no one's fault. And so you tell the child their little construct of glue, cardboard and pasta is 'unique' and you watch their little faces glow.

Unique can be a backhanded compliment. The way a drunk driver handles the wheel is probably very unique. Same thing for how someone with three fingers would handle a knife or knitting needles. In the creative landscape we live in now, we have begun to conflate 'unique' with 'good', because that landscape is so saturated with overdone concepts and pitches that we reflexively assume that if something hasn't been done before, its gonna be special when it is.

Freeform is a backhanded comment as well. My issue with freeform is that its not truly freeform. If you call someone's work freeform, what are you really saying? That they forwent all the rules and created something splendid? Or that they forwent all the rules and now we must employ the intellectual escape hatch that is 'art is subjective', and tell them that their inability to grasp the rules of poetry is in itself, a way to make poetry?

And I think that's the crux of this poem and the many others that follow it. Truly freeform poetry does not exist, based on my very uninformed opinion. We play by the rules of poetry because these rules are more than just numbers and rhymes and timing. Rhyming structures appeal to your brain for the same reasons why tessellating plane geometry does; something ancient and latent in our programming is being scratched in just the right way. When you forgo that entirely, you get a work that we humans simply struggle to find enjoyable.

And I will say that I somewhat didn't enjoy the poem because it is a poem only in the appearance of line breaks and stanzas. I will cap this section off by saying that I do not read a lot of poetry, or any at all really, and that it is very plausible that my comments here are skewed by the fact I do not like the medium, but I have been - as much as I could be - as fair as possible.

Onwards.

### Section #2 - Prose 1 & 2 (Green and Yellow typeface)
Prose. Here I can speak a little more confidently.

Structural analysis. Sound punctuation that creates good cadence. Grammar is equally as sound, saying exactly what I perceive as needed in far less words than I would have done it. Hemingway gave it an eighth grade reading level, which it considers a good thing. While I disagree with how Hemingway declares what is readable and what isn't, I do agree with it that it is very readable.

If I am to make any comment at all, it's that this section greatly benefits from repeated reading. On the first half dozen times I read this section, I wondered if a reader would get caught on the physicality of truth as it is spoken about in the work. As someone who is used to how we discuss, I fully grasp what you mean. Someone not used to discussing these abstract terms would probably stumble a bit on the usage of truth so many times in one body of text, but later rereads reveals that it is not necessary to have a deep philosophical grasp of 'truth', but rather, the willingness to accept certain logical conclusions made in the work that simply make sense.

> that Absolute Truth means the thing that reality is.

> the real Sword of Truth is more like a mirror - the only mirror in the universe whose reflection is accurate, so perfect that it is indistinguishable from reality itself.

> But it was obvious to the witch that there could be only one Truth.

These things, pondered for all of thirty seconds, make sense, and so this section of prose works. Well done.

Speaking on the actual contents, it continues narrative in a way that is simple and effective. The first poetry section mentions the sword and the daemon, and now we are addressing what those are. Simple stuff but devastating when done poorly. This section is splendid.

I'll take the next couple sections as a cohesive unit.

### Section #3 - Poem 2, Prose 3, Poem 3 (Purple, Lime, Red Typeface)
We return to poetry and my comments remain fairly the same, though I feel there is something I think I did not give you enough credit for and that is how you link line length, indentation, and word repetition to create some truly splendid cadence.

>Even while their body burned,
	even while their mind dissolved,
		even as their world
			cracked.

This is good shit. This is the rules of poetry right here. The way our brain parses this is very noticeable, and it evokes the feel of the weightiness of what is being depicted once we reach the final word. It's something I wish you did here earlier;

>the most intricate of formulas,
the sacred geometry,
the ultimate equation
		of that crystal.

Factually speaking, you did. Subjectively however, I'd have like to have seen that same staircase-style descending line structure, suspense until the final release. This, again, is good stuff.

Here's another very good section;

>They assembled
the seven metals of antiquity
	placed in seven crucibles
	arranged in accordance
		with their corresponding wanderers
		and bound by alchemy
to form a celestial alloy.

Something about how line 2 perfectly connects to line 7, it's really good. It's the poetry equivalent of how I use the m-dash, and *that* is the equivalent of breaking off one coherent thought to nest another one within it, then resuming the initial, except it has been empowered by the meat you have placed in it.

We can even careen back to Poem #1 and see this again;

>And of course
	befitting their imagined role as hero
this arcane tool,
this mythic object,
this weapon of legendary power,
	would be a sword.

Let me tell you what your poems need but this is based off an assumption that I implore you to not see as rudeness; you tried this suspense-inducing word repetition either on complete accident - a stroke of minor artistic genius - or as something you saw used somewhere else. I am going to say that - knowing you - it is simply highly unlikely that you went into this work without having done some prior reading, no matter how small, and that was enough to find this little nifty bit and apply it to your own work, which you did very well. If it is the case that studying other works led you to adapt what they did into your own work - splendid - you are on the very obviously correct path.

But if this was accidental, and once you realized it sounded good, you applied it to the rest of the pieces, then I will say that what you need to cultivate is intent. You cannot rely on flashes of genius and inspiration like that, you instead need to cultivate skills so that flashes become unnecessary - that you are always able to produce eight-out-of-ten work at any given time, rather than five-out-of-ten work with ten-out-of-ten sections. The path to this is study. If you intend your work to have poetry as a prominent component, you must be deliberate about your creation of it. You have to start tryharding at all times rather than clutching in the most necessary moments.

But please, more of this good cadence;

>So when the magic lashed out,
	when their power failed
	to contain the ritual
	still
		they did
		not
		stop.

The 'they did // not // stop'? Splendid. Like gunshots cracking the dusk. Hammer blows on the back of a chisel. They hit with raw power. 

Final stretch.

### Section #4 - Prose 4 & 5 (Pink and Blue typeface)
My favorite part was when Hexagonelle said "It's hexagonning time." and hexagonned all over the place. 

Jokes aside, this is a good section. Structurally, I appreciate the usage of color to indicate the speech and thoughts of the two parties. Very creative, and lends a certain amount of 'otherworldliness' to the character of the daemon (demon? you alternate a fair bit). 

And the narrative itself? Gripping. Speaking purely on this as a story, I am very interested in what comes after this. Pacts with some kind of higher being is always a recipe for some interesting explorations of character and interaction. I have little else to say here. As far as first chapters go, this is a good one, ticking all the boxes I expect from them. Very good work.

## Part Two
### Section #1 - Poem 1 (Blue & Red typeface)
More of the same, though some sections here read even more like prose than the ones in Part One;

>	Then the cave opened up, revealing
a grand cavern:
	weak winter sunlight
pouring in from an opening high above
and a great oak,
surrounded by greenery and birds,
	branching up toward the opening
at the roof of the cave.

>Then the cave opened up, revealing a grand cavern, weak winter sunlight pouring in from an opening high above, and a great oak, surrounded by greenery and birds, branching up toward the opening at the roof of the cave. 

Little else to say here other than what I've said before. Granted, 'go study' is no more advice than 'just fix it' is. I've taken the liberty of about, a solid ten minutes of googling and reading webpages for what I feel are fairly useful resources worth perusing;

The last link in particular discusses 'narrative' and 'prose' poetry, which I encourage you to give a look as I reckon it will serve your purposes nicely.

### Section #2 - Prose 1 (Green typeface)
Prose. Solid prose. We are introduced to the character of Rurik and without being told, we already have a fair idea of what Rurik is, as well as some tidbits for those trying to imagine what kind of world that this tale is situated in, as regards to technology at least. Combining all we know before with what we've obtained now, we have a 'magi-tech' setting of sorts. Alchemy, metals, powders and crucibles meet our Geiger counters and oscilloscopes. The world broadens a little bit with this, in a way that gets the reader's mind turning. Well done.

### Section #3 - Poem 2 (Light blue typeface)
This;

>Yet more sensations followedâ€¦
	A phantom shiver,
in a body that didnâ€™t exist.
	A sense of tilting,
like banking a hard curve.
	The taste of bitterness.
A pitch so loud the witch couldnâ€™t bear it.

Call. Answer. Cadence. I love it. 

### Section #4 - Prose 2 (Purple typeface)
> **The noise startled Rurik so badly that he fell flat on his ass**

Poor guy.

But good prose. As we near the end, my comments reduce in length as we risk going over things we've already addressed. 

> Rurik began to test inputs of simple **sine waves**...

>Rurik rushed out of the room, scrambling for a book on the **Turing Test.**

A note and a warning; you are both doing a splendid amount of 'show don't tell' here, but you are also - intentionally or not - 'dating' your work. We have expectations of the universe now; either it's ours and around the time these things like the Turing Test exist in documents as accessible as can be 'scrambled for', or this is an alternate universe where they curiously evolved all these things and - rather curiously - chose the same names for them as we did.

Rurik, to the best of my knowledge, is an unconventional name. While you are free to quite literally do whatever you choose, a nitpicky worldbuilder like me would find Rurik an interesting name for a character in a world similar enough to ours for the Turing Test to exist both in name and what it refers to - a measure of non-human intelligence. It's like if you were reading a fictional work about, say an imaginary law firm called 'Arrawen and Leonidas, Attorneys at Law'. Now you could easily come up with an explanation such as the incorporators of the firm being twin brothers raised by nerdy pop-culture parents, but without such an explanation, people will take notice when a character called Rurik meets someone called - say - Timothy or Martha in chapter three. 

### Section #5 - Poem 3 & Prose 3 (Pink & Green typeface)
The poetry returns and so do my criticism, so we'll talk about the content itself.

Now we get some really interesting stuff. The world - as the Witch understands it - is in fact, wholly the same as they remember, and they are left to ponder the implications of this as regards the loss of their sorcery. 

And at the very end we are given something of a forwards kick to the plot. The Witch wants their body back in whatever form possible. They are in a familiar and yet not context, shackled by pact to something from beyond the horizon of understanding, and at the mercy of this figure Rurik. It as good as a start as you can ask for. Nigh unlimited potential.

## Closing Remarks
As you could say about nearly anything ever, there is potential here. Prose is solid, narrative pitch gripping, all I can advise really is delving more into the mechanics of crafting your poetry. 

I applaud the usage of font color, font style and spacing to add detail to some areas and differentiation to others. While I personally would have had a single color for prose, another for poetry, and more for each character's dialogue, I will not say this is a necessarily superior way of doing this. 

And most of all, I applaud writing at all. It's not easy, or rather it's not easy to do well. And that often is why some never try. But you did and I greatly respect that, and I am very warmed by the fact you chose me to review it for you. I hope I haven't been needlessly harsh or inarticulate. 

Cheers then.
