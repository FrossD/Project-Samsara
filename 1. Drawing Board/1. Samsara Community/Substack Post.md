# The Samsara Project
What is the Samsara Project? 

It is an ambitious science-fantasy worldbuilding project, where Striders wielding the Strider Protocol traverse the cosmos as perpetual nomads, seeking power, fame and fortune among the stars. With the power of the Weave Protocol and the world of Chalk, they weave powerful weapons and abilities and cast rituals to reshape the course of the Current, guided by inner doctrines as they clash with great, lattice-hungry beasts, ancient vault-guarding automata, rituals of yesteryear that turn regions of the Great Sky to ruin, surging storms that threaten to fling you to the dark below - and other Striders who find their doctrines in opposition... to yours. Journey from the highest Fel-Arcad arcologies to the deepest Conclaves of Vahnkin atop the Amaranth Sea, pursuing knowledge and power on a quest to strike the hardest chisel-blows in the marble slate of history. But do not become Shattered along the way.

A hundred and twenty thousand words in the making, the Samsara Project is a massive undertaking, yet we are already seeing the first fruits of development, as we begin bravely with work on the first narrative block known as 'Act One'. There is a lot to see, and even more to learn. If you want to get involved in this journey, the Samsara Project has gone public access, and anyone is free to read and join the discussion forum to get a piece of the action. Our greatest adventures still lie ahead of us.
