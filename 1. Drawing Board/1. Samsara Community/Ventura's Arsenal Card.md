				  *"I've put more rounds through this thing than I care to count. It's saved my life more times too. I'm asked 'How do I be a better Operator?' - again - more times than I care to count. My answer is always the same; get hardware you can trust. Get good at using it. Take it everywhere you go. Let it become your right hand."*
			
			Precision-modified eight-shot high caliber revolver forged from the billowing tapestry of a witch-strider who left destruction in their wake. Secondary structural and ritual modification has shaped it into a weapon that has earned considerable repute for its seemingly impossible accuracy.
			
			- Offensive
			  **Compression Chamber** - Brch, Induc
				  *"To last long on this job, you have to adapt. You must be thinking two steps ahead of every possible enemy. You must have an answer for even unasked questions."*
			
			  When **more than four rounds are present** in the Sojourner's Tale, manipulating the ritualism within the chamber allows for **compressing all available rounds into a single, final round** that **gains explosive properties**, allowing it to **breach and destroy armor**, as well as inflict a **heavy inductive stagger** on those struck.

			- Utility
			  **Sidewinder Feathergrips**
				  *"Pick a thing and do it excellently. I picked guns; it's paid off."*
			
			  When Sojourner's Tale is **holstered**, the wielder may invoke the power of the **Mindspun Sidewinder**, a mythic beast with a serpentine body built for svelte movements and subtlety. When invoked, **all firearms** in hand **handle and reload considerably faster, are more accurate, and gain recoil mitigation and heat dissipation**. 
			  
			- Feat
			  **Sidewinder Feed System**
			  Axle: Flashchargew
				  *"Adopt the language of the Academy; we do not 'defeat', we crush, and we do so with overwhelming force."*
			  
			  When the Sojourner's Tale is **holstered**, the wielder may invoke the power of the Mindspun Sidewinder, a mythic beast with fangs of chrome, and venom like mercury. When invoked, **all firearms are overclocked**, gaining a massive **boost to their firing speed** and a passive **unlimited supply of calcic ammunition**. This includes firearms the wielder has in hand, and **firing systems they can touch**, such as stationary turrets and cannons mounted to vehicles.

	- Charge
		- **Interceptor Flechette** - Imbue
		  Axle: Tek | Trajectory Calculator
		  
		- **Saboteur's Salvo** - Grenade - Induc, Brch, Comp
			  *"Operators win because we don't fight fair. They see our parades and award ceremonies and think there's an underlying sense of honor and nobility to the entire thing. It's all theater; ask anyone in the Panopticon."*
		  
		  Chalk is woven into three projectiles which can be thrown. Upon detonation, they explode into light, sound, create a pressure wave and disseminate viral weave. Targets caught in the blast are blinded and staggered, and Slates or slate-reliant technologies have their computational processes interrupted by calcic noise.
		  
	- Shield
		- **Interceptor Net** - Active - Cado, Brch
		  Axle: Tek | Trajectory Calculator
			  *"Mastering this was when I truly learned of the gap that existed between those who could weave chalk, and the rest."*
		
		Usage of the slide rules allows for deploying a net of weave from a free hand, which can intercept and arrest the momentum of any projectile that strikes it. This technique inflicts an amount of unravelling on the caster, and the amount increases based on the size and number of the projectiles blocked.
		
		- **Gunfighter's Shield** - Active - Cado, Brch
			  *"Often, the only way out is through."*
		  
		When a firearm is in hand, the wielder may deploy a transparent shield of weave around the scope, that shields the face and body of the wielder carrying the weapon. This shield has durability, and it breaks after considerable damage, how soon depending on the power and number of projectiles blocked. This shield also adds weight to the weapon, making handling it slightly more cumbersome.
		  
	- Dash
		- **Marksman's Gambit**
			  *"Stay alert and on your feet. If you can breathe, move, and legend has it you'll keep breathing for a while longer."*
		
		The caster performs a deft standing spin, while deploying a sphere of weave around them. If projectiles are present or enter the sphere of weave while the dodge is being performed, they are unraveled into chalk and re-spun into ammunition in the magazine of the caster's currently held weapon. 
		  
	
- T3 - Advanced Calcic
	- Tek
		- **Trajectory Calculator**
			*"If you want to go far as an Operator, you want to get a Tek early on. Hopefully a good one, but that's subjective. Mine is simple, maybe even weak, but I've gone as far as I have because I know how to use. Some Striders can breathe fire or throw stars; me? I just never get hit and never miss."*
		
		 The Trajectory Calculator interfaces directly with the bearer's Weavesight, enhancing its normal functions and granting it new ones. When activated, the Tek draws slide rules in space visible only in bearer, taking the form of graduated gossamer strings. When the slide rules are active, the bearer is able to track the movement of any object in space, as well as anticipate its movement using its present and previous positions. 
		
		 When an object such as a projectile enters the view of the bearer of the Tek, lines are drawn emanating from it, indicating its vector components in three-dimensional space and their resultant; the path it it is currently taking. This path is represented by a line that is drawn from the projectile to a range of places where it is likely to strike, represented as a flaring of the end of the line into a cone. These cones are deliberately employed to reduce the computational overhead of the Tek when in use, and thus the unravelling it inflicts on the caster.
		
		 Additionally, it can anticipate projectiles before they are even fired. Knowledge of a firearm's make and the rounds it uses allows the Tek to draw an extended cone from the gun's barrel to where a projectile fired from it might strike. Even if the details of a projectile weapon are not known, observation of the weapon in action allows for forming a model of its firing behavior, enabling computation towards anticipating where fired projectiles might strike.
		
		 Non-projectiles - or simply 'bodies' - can also be tracked and their movement paths calculated. A vehicle in motion can have its speed deduced and where it will be at a given time deduced by the slide rules. A thrown punch can be evaded by deducing its path towards the face. Even the time of day can be computed by watching the movement of stellar bodies.
		
		 Where the Tek sees considerable utility is in calculating interceptions and rebounds. If a projectile is able to rebound, such as a rubber ball or hard-metal bullet, the path it will take after rebounding can be calculated. If a known weapon is readied, or parameters of some other launch system such as a device or even the arms are fed to the Tek, it can deduce the parameters needed to intercept another body midflight. If a projectile is in motion and a firearm is readied, the slide rules can indicate where the bearer of the Tek must aim to obtain a maximal chance of intercepting the projectile with a fired shot.

		  **Tunnel Vision**
		  *"All or nothing."*
		  Culls all other active trajectory calculations down to minuscule number, and utilizes all available resources towards calculating these trajectories to ensure maximal accuracy.

		  **Intercept Overwatch**
		  *"Become strong, not for yourself, but for others."*
		  Axle: Flashcharge
		  By sacrificing all other functions, the caster is able to calculate and simulate the movement of all bodies over a colossal area, as well as the measures needed to intercept them accordingly. An area as vast as a multi-domain (land, sea, air) battlefield can have individual bullets intercepted through chain reactions of rebounded shots fired or caused by the caster.
