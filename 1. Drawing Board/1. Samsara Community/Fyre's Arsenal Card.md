# Draft 1: Arsenal Card Live Example
Using the Samsara-analogue of Fyresworde as a character to inspire the concepts used for abilities and powers here.

- T1 - Relic Armaments
	- Martial Arms
		- **1530 Centigrade** - CINDER-031-F#DAYSTAR - Longsword
		  *"I don't remember a time I didn't carry it."* 
		  (Description)
			- Offensive
			  **Echostrikes** - Cado, Induc
			  *"I can do twice the swordplay with half the effort."*
			  When swinging the Centigrade, a flaming phantom twin of the blade follows it. Consisting entirely of weave, this phantom twin will mirror actions made with the main blade, adding a burn inductive component to attacks made with it and allowing for passive follow-up strikes on attacks. Deflecting the phantom blade requires calcic measures to be taken, allowing it to cut what the main blade cannot.
			  
			- Defensive
			  **Stardance** - Induc
			  *"Lol."*
			  Turning the Centigrade's flat towards a target will - if they are capable of using it - parry their weavesight or other calcic-reliant sight abilities back at them, coupled with weave baked into the weapon, inflicting a blind induction that lingers momentarily.
			  
			- Utility (N/A)
			- Feat (N/A)
		  
		- **Plan C** (PHldr.) - Vault Relic - Club
		  *"I wouldn't recommend it; it's gotten too easy to not feel."*
		  (Description)
			- Offensive (N/A)
			- Defensive
			  **Guntrigger Parry**
			  *"Immensely cool."*
			  The Plan C is holstered in an specially-engineered sheath that is mounted to the non-dominant arm. Tied to this sheath's engineering is a trigger that can be engaged by a single finger of the non-dominant hand. When engaged, renewable gas-firing mechanisms at the bottom of the sheath fire, launching the Plan C until it comes to a harsh stop at the end of the sheath, exposing inches of the weapon's blade. Any calcic attack that strikes the blade will complete a ritual in the blade's inner workings, and be summarily redirected.
			- Utility (N/A)
			- Feat
			  **Sun-smitten Apathy** - Prax
			  Axle: Flashcharge, Relic Defensive | Gun-trigger Parry
			  *"They asked how I could keep fighting. Now that I've told them, they've asked whether I'll know when to stop."*
			  When a flashcharge is available, Gun-trigger Parry is upgraded into Apathy of the Sun-smitten. When an event is occurring in the vicinity in a manner that can be interpreted as 'occurring **to** the caster', the flashcharge can be expended to parry it a the doctrinal level, eliminating whatever effects it would have had on the caster. This power can be used to parry nearly anything, from the flashes of other Striders to the emotional response upon hearing bad news.
	
- T2 - Elementary Calcic
	- Weave Strike
		- **Underhand** - Bolt - Induc.
		  *"Heh."*
		  Particulate matter is spun with chalk and flung in the direction of an attacker. Latent guidance-weave sees it target moisture; the mouth, nose and - most annoyingly - the eyes. It inflicts an inductive blind that lingers momentarily. 
		  
	- Weave Charge
		- **Sunlight Spear** - Blast - Cado, Induc
		  Axle: Tek | Starfire Conduit
		  *"I keep a free hand for this very reason."*
		  Chalk is woven into a defense-piercing bolt, then suffused with equations that fold chalk into searing heat, allowing for inflicting heavy caedometric damage and a burn effect. It can be further empowered by Tek, allowing for inflicting **starfire flames** against targets.
		  
	- Weave Shield
		- **Fencer's Offhand** - Passive - Cado, Brch
		  *"Shields just slow you down."*
		  The entire non-dominant hand from shoulder to fingertips is covered in densely woven chalk that protects it from various true damage forms. The bindings of weave on the hands allows for **catching enemy weapons**, gaining control and allowing for various counter-attacks.
		  
	- Weave Dash
		- **Dodgeroll**
		  *"Deceptively effective when not spammed."*
		  A short roll performed on the ground, the athleticism of the move enhanced by weave. Lowering the size of the effective profile allows for meandering past attacks, especially from larger targets with equally larger weapons.
		  
	- Weave Armament (N/A)
	  *"I have enough swords as it is."*
	
- T3 - Advanced Calcic
	- Tek
		- **Starfire Conduit**
		  *"It burns a little sometimes."*
		  Accumulators, reservoirs and conduits built into the local lattice allows for the synthesis and dissemination of **Starfire**, chalk woven into matter that embodies the ferocity of stellar cores. The starfire can be casted normally in various offensive and defensive forms, augment other abilities, and be expended in rituals. Where starfire is used, it creates **starfire flames**, white-gold fire that burns incredibly hot and inflicts considerable amounts of induction damage.
		  
		  Utilizing the starfire is done by opening pathways to relevant parts of the body, achieved through 'popping' the joints at those regions. Beginning the flow of starfire throughout the local lattice is done by cracking the neck, which opens a computational strait pathway that awakens the sub-lattice systems. Conduction of starfire to the fingers is achieved by cracking the knuckles, and to the legs by doing similar for the ankles. Massaging the temple opens channels to the eyes, doing similar for the hinge of jaw opens channels to the mouth, and various other stretches and massaging motions opens channels to the rest of the body.
		  
		  When the first conduit is opened, the subjects reserves of starfire begin depleting. Starfire accumulates passively so long as the subject is in the Dancirah, and accumulates more quickly based on nearness to stars of the Switchboard. Fully depleting the starfire reserves renders the Tek unusable. Slate integration allows for measuring and thus tracking the amount of starfire left, as well as additional functions such as electrical triggers for conduits and flow-rate monitoring. In the absence of this, the subject must rely on an internal sense of temperature; starfire keeps the body at well above normal levels, and a descent to below normal bodily temperatures is often the sign the starfire wells have run dry.
		  
		  When starfire is depleted, starfire flames in the environment can be **re-absorbed**, filling the starfire reservoirs with **ashflame**. This ashflame burns black and cold, and inflicts inductive and **siphon** damage on targets, depleting their chalk reserves. The presence of ashflame in the conduits prevents **passive** accumulation of starfire, however, and slows down the functions of the subject, reducing their combat prowess. Ashflame that burns chalk however, will gradually **transmute** back into starfire, which can be reabsorbed into the conduits and used again.
			  
			- Offensive
			  **Immolated Ground** - Induc
			  *"They see you with a sword and think 'there's no way' and it catches them. Every time."*
			  Slamming the ground with a foot allows for sending out spirals of starfire flame, immolating the surface on which they are deployed. Additional chalkweaving can be used to control their speed and direction, as well as allowing the spirals to seek out targets in the vicinity.
			  
			- Defensive
			  **Honorshield** - Cado, Brch
			  *"I like to see the whites of their eyes."*
			   A passive ability that when activated, draws on the computational line to initialize two intangible spheres in space, centered on the head of the caster. One sphere - the **boundary** - is large and stationary, moving in line with the caster. The second sphere - the **marker** - is smaller and moves along the surface of the former, its movement tied to the direction the caster is looking in. When a projectile attack enters the marker, it is struck heavily by starfire flames in an attempt to destroy it. This measure can only be used against projectiles within the boundary confines of the boundary sphere. Projectiles are selected for elimination based on the computations of the computational strait, and this cast inflicts heavy **unravelling** on the caster.
			   
			- Utility
			  **Nightmist** - Induc
			  *"Sometimes you just gotta get out of there."*
			  When ashflame is available, it can be expelled from the mouth as a dense, choking cloud of black fume. Targets who inhale it have their chalk siphoned, their lattices chilled by inductive damage, and are at risk of starfire flame erupting in their bodies. Weavesight and other sight abilities are unable to pierce the dense cloud.
			  
			- Burst
			  **Lunarstrikes** - Cado, Brch, Induc, Siph
			  Axle: Martial Arm | 1530 Centigrade
			  *"Now cometh the age of the stars."*
			  Ashflame is suffused into a weapon, and a series of powerful, sweeping cuts are made against a target, shattering their defenses, inflicting inductive cold-burns, and siphoning a considerable amount of chalk. This attack can only be performed when the starfire reserves are majorly filled with ashflame. Upon cast, half of all ashflame expended is refunded as starfire in the reserves.
		
	- Quis (N/A)
	  *"Never was good at the damn things."*
	
- T4 - Grand Calcic
	- Rituals
		- **Stargift: Opening Gambit** - Cast
		  Axle: Tek | Starfire Conduit
		  *"I made this one to pass a class. And to end things quickly. But mainly to pass a class."*
		  The caster creates a site of ritual geometry and expends components, including a vast majority of the starfire reserves. Upon successful cast, all starfire fed to the ritual is unwound and converted into raw chalk that saturates the local lattice. This huge infusion of chalk allows for a **free use** of the subject's **Flash Protocol**.
		  
		- **Stargift: Leyndell Squall** - Channeled - Induc, Siph
		  Axle: Tek | Starfire Conduit
		  *"I hate to see what Spyndl has become, but perhaps it is what we deserve. Perhaps something will rise from this ash, but I am not hopeful."*
		  The caster creates a site of ritual geometry and expends components, including a considerable amount of ashflame. The ritual resolves as a bottled tempest in the chest of caster, which can then be blown into the world as a tumultuous tornado of burning cold and chalk-siphoning blackness. Weave integrated into the cast allows it to mark and pursue targets, aiming to consume their chalk. As it consumes, the ashflame becomes starfire and the tornado grows more intense, burning everything in its path. The tornado ends when dismissed by the caster, or after reaching a size at which it can no longer maintain structural soundness.
	
- T5 - Flash Protocol
	- Flashes
		- **Crownsplitter** - Flash Strike - Cado, Brch, Unrav, Prax
		  *"This is the power to fell kings."*
		  The caster burns the entirety of their flash, and performs a nigh-unblockable downward strike with a weapon in hand, dealing absolutely massive damage, shattering all defenses, and rendering the target nearly unable to use chalk dependent powers. The attack has a praxis component to it, and will do additional damage if the target;
		  - Is a Strider or Weaver
		  - Is an Operator
		  - Is a leader of some regard in a litany of Switchboard organizations
		  - Bears a Title
		  - Wields multiple Teks
		  - Has performed or been a part of a structural cast
