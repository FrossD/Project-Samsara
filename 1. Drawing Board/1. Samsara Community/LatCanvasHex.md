The Bayesian Slate Mind is the principle that a Strider gains power via efficient usage of information. Information is the fuel for the engine that is the mind. Consequently, to run without flaw the mind must extra the useful parts of information, must perceive correlations and their magnitudes correctly.

Information Tangibility, on the other hand, is the principle that these correlations can be manipulated once understood - in the form of chalk. All things are chalk, all can be unfolded and refolded, if only one comprehends the correlations between the unfolded form and the refolded form.

And finally, Fractal Infometry is the principle that the part is of the whole and the whole is of the part. One page of a book contains all the information of that book. By perceiving the correlations between page and book (Bayesian Slate Mind), one can reconstruct the whole of the book from the part (Information Tangibility). Likewise, the book is defined by the page. By again perceiving correlations betwteen page and book, one can alter the properties of the entire book merely by altering the page.

The combination of theese three principles culminates in the Lattice as Canvas.

## *The mind is of the body. The body is of the mind.* 

One of the first skills a Strider learns is decentralization of mind. A Strider does not think and remember with just their brain; they utilize their entire lattice as a Bayesian engine. Therefore a Strider is more subject that normal to Fractal Infometry. They bear the weight of their knowledge in their very selves, and that has the potential change the physical form of a Strider...

### The Core

There is an asymmetry in how Striders may be affected by the information they wield, similar to the asymmetry in genetic mutations: mutations are more likely to be harmful than helpful. Likewise, if information changes a Strider's physical being, it is more likely to be detrimental than of benefit.

For this reason, Striders are trained early on to focus an essential element of their being into an immutable core. The core is essentially a philosophy that the Strider lives by, a fundamental aspect of their personality and beliefs.

As a result, *any* modification to the Lattice - intentional or otherwise - becomes difficult for Striders, as it would disrupt the core that Striders spend years honing to be resolute in the face of possible mutation.

Truly integrated bodily modification is therefore rare. While cybernetics and prostheses are possible, and decorative elements may be added or altered, these are often more like a costume to the Strider, one that they can cast off if they so choose. The costume may become frayed or discarded during battle without damaging the Strider, as it isn't an inherent part of the self.

As an example, a Strider with wings travelling too near a Law Star may find that while their core can endure the pounding radiation of random information, their adornments cannot, and will dissolve under the barrage of the Law Star, leaving the Strider wingless.

To experience true integration, a Strider must overcome some burden, must accept some theretofore unaccepted truth, must reach a world-shattering ephiphany that shakes the foundations of their beliefs. Under such a metaphysical crucible, the Strider's philosophy - and therefore their bodily self - becomes mutable. A Strider may not always choose to change their physical appearance after such an event, but many do so (either intentionally or unintentionally) as a result of this life-changing experience.

Trauma is often a source of such a change. The most common case is for functional prosthetics, such as arms, legs, eyes, etc. that replace an existing body part. Losing a limb for anyone is a traumatic experience, and in overcoming that trauma, they open themselves up to being fully integrated with a prosthetic. However, it should be noted that not all Striders are capable of healthily processing trauma, and some never come to terms with their loss.

The same holds with other experiences. Ephiphanies are dangerous, in the same way that any information is dangerous. A wise Strider does not go looking for an idea that has the potential to break their core. But, in the course of their lives, Striders may discover new concepts that change their previously held beliefs, that challenge ideas they once thought unchallengable. If they are brave enough to embrace the change, to engage with it, to learn and grow from it, they have the opportunity to perform a Lattice Ritual.

## Lattice Ritual

A lattice ritual is a specific type of ritual that uses the Strider themselves as raw material to weave new components, or modify existing ones.
