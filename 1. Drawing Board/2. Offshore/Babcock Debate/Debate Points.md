# Debate
"Will virtual reality replace traditional cinema?"

## First Speaker's Pass
### Main Points
- As technology has evolved, the theatrical space has done likewise, and we have observed over time that the media we create has come to be shaped by the dominant technologies at the time. As such, the proliferation of VR technologies will thus allow for new kinds of media to be created, and in turn provides a new frontier to be explored by filmmakers. Moving from the planar big screen to the 360o format of viewer will turn spawn new media experiences that take advantage of it.
	> This is the point on scope.

- One of the criteria by which we - consciously or not - judge a fictional work is how well it can sell us on the reality of its depiction of fiction. Extensive work is done to facilitate deeper immersion into the worlds of the stories we tell, and useful towards this end is the technology we use to do so. The 360o format of VR allows for greater immersion into the experience of viewing media, which provides altogether a greater *enjoyment* of media.
	> This is the point on immersion.

And if time allows;
- VR provides the convenience and privacy of not having to go to a physical location and engage in the rigmarole of conventional cinema, as well as be compelled to engage in a space with other people who might degrade the actual viewing experience for media. 

#### Point: Scope
**The History of Cinema**
The history of cinema is a fascinating journey that spans more than a century, evolving from simple moving images to a sophisticated and influential art form. Here is a brief overview of the key milestones in the history of cinema:

1. **Pre-cinema (Before 1895):**
   - The concept of capturing and reproducing motion predates cinema. Early devices such as the zoetrope and phenakistoscope featured sequential images that created the illusion of motion when spun.

2. **Invention of Cinematography (1890s):**
   - The Lumière brothers, Auguste and Louis Lumière, are often credited with the invention of cinematography. In 1895, they presented the first public screening of films using their Cinématographe in Paris, marking the birth of cinema. Their short films, like "Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat," amazed audiences.

3. **Silent Film Era (1895-1927):**
   - Silent films dominated the early years of cinema. Pioneering filmmakers such as Georges Méliès and D.W. Griffith experimented with storytelling techniques and film grammar. Griffith's "The Birth of a Nation" (1915) is considered a landmark in narrative filmmaking.

4. **The Golden Age of Hollywood (1920s-1950s):**
   - The 1920s saw the rise of Hollywood as the center of the film industry. The advent of synchronized sound in "The Jazz Singer" (1927) marked the end of the silent era. The 1930s and 1940s are considered the "Golden Age of Hollywood," featuring iconic films and stars such as Clark Gable, Marilyn Monroe, and Humphrey Bogart.

5. **World War II and Postwar Period (1939-1960s):**
   - World War II had a significant impact on the film industry, leading to the rise of film noir and war-themed movies. After the war, the 1950s brought about the widescreen format and the use of color, adding new dimensions to filmmaking.

6. **New Wave and Global Cinema (1960s-1970s):**
   - The 1960s and 1970s witnessed the emergence of New Wave movements in various countries, such as the French New Wave and the American New Hollywood. Filmmakers like Jean-Luc Godard and Francis Ford Coppola challenged traditional storytelling norms.

7. **Blockbusters and Advances in Technology (1980s-1990s):**
   - The 1980s saw the rise of blockbuster films, driven by directors like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Advances in special effects and the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) revolutionized filmmaking, as seen in films like "Star Wars" and "Jurassic Park."

8. **Digital Age and Contemporary Cinema (2000s-Present):**
   - The 21st century brought about a shift from traditional film to digital technology. The rise of independent cinema, streaming platforms, and global collaborations has diversified the industry. Notable trends include the dominance of franchises, increased representation, and the blending of genres.

The key bits to take here to use in the debate are 
- **3. The Silent Film Era** 
- **7. Blockbusters and Advances in Technology (1980s-1990s):*
- **8. Digital Age and Contemporary Cinema (2000s-Present):**
as these dates mark intersections of technology and new kinds of film created.

The new platform allows for filmmakers to realize grander visions for film, in which a film is not something you sit in front of and watch, but rather something you sit *within* and are a part of.
