# Project Samsara Patch Notes
The patch notes for Project Samsara.

This document is arranged such that newer patches and their notes appear at the top. Refer to these patches when new updates drop to stay up to date with the Samsara canon.

## XX/07/24 - dot1.2 - 'Mindcrack'
Some new additions that are gradually building towards the next Samsara project. Much of this writ and the writ to come is highly relevant to this project.

To speak more on the actual contents of this patch, it is an overdue formalization of the concept of minds in the canon, as well as the surrounding and foundational concepts concerning their natural and artificial formation/synthesis, their behavior, and how they are harnessed from both mechanical and narrative standpoints. Much of the new and revised material is centered in [[SB_Technology]]. 

### Additions
- Added 'Mercurials' to [[SB_Biota]]
> A fun one, and relevant to something I'm cooking.
- Added the heading on 'The Raconteurs' to [[The Doctrine of Passing]]
> Another fun one, and this one in particular gives me joy in what I've built. 
- Added the heading '**SBTech: Mind Engineering**' to [[SB_Technology]].
> A major addition that tackles a breadth of topics related to minds.
- Added a section on 'Bodily Thermals' to  [[SB_Physiology]]
> Thanks Mel.
- Added a concluding section on the 'Kin-shape' to [[SB_Physiology]]
> A somewhat rambling section that explains my vision for building the unique physiology of the denizens of the Switchboard.
- Added a concluding section on 'The Building of All Things' to [[Calcodynamics]]
> If you're a worldbuilder yourself or want some insight into the guiding principles of many of Samsara's design quirks, consider giving this one a look.

### Revisions
- Revisions to the **H#15 - 'Technology'** heading in the [[The Fel-Arcad]] document, targeting the matters of crucibles and Purposed Minds
	- 'Purposed Minds' is now 'Verdant Minds', to focus on the Fel-Arcad specific application of the tech
	- 'Crucibles' is now 'Sembleworks Crucibles', for the same reason
> These now call to the relevant sections in SBTech as their origin, rather than having them originate within the Fel-Arcad doc.
- Revisions to 'Output Maximization & Self-Impositions' in [[Extended Disciplines]]
	- Now called 'Apex Weaving', the spirit of the concept remains, but it has been massively cleaned up and rebuilt in a manner that makes more sense and works better with the rest of the verse mechanics. 

### Migrations
- Moved the heading on 'Weftloaders' from [[Communications and Compute]] to [[SB_Technology]]
> It was more apt to place it there, as it was a technology that stood alone and merely depended on aspects of the original doc to function, rather than lending more weight to the subject discussed in the original doc.
- Moved the [[Ven_AC]], [[Blakk_AC]], [[Freedryck_AC]], [[Fyre_AC]] and [[Hex_AC]] into a new directory.

### Expansions
- Expansions on various bits concerning the Mindspun, Purposed Minds, the New Thinkers, crucibles and canon that calls back to the Dawn of the Dancirah, all found in [[SB_Technology]].
- Touched on 'Technique Collapse' in [[Extended Disciplines]]
	- It has now been renamed to the 'Collapse Function', given more writ on how it works relative to mechanics outlined in [[The Astrolabe]], and also has an example of it in action taken from Adven Ventura's arsenal card ([[Ven_AC]]).

## 02/07/24 - dot1.1
The first post launch patch. Some clean-ups stemming from feedback following launch, and new and expanded writ.

### Additions
- Added the revision of Armor to [[Weave and Warfare]]
> I somehow forgot I revised this and didn't ship it with U24dot1; my bad.
- Added writ on the 'Tomic Stomp' to [[Extended Disciplines]]
> Sup Blakk.
- Added the entry on 'Recurve Strafers' to [[SB_Technology]]
> We have hoverboards now.

### Revisions
- Fixed a number of grammatical and punctuation errors.
> Thanks Mel.

### Migrations
- Moved the following headings from [[The Doctrine of Passing]] to [[Family Addendums]];
	- Concept: The Social Implications of the strider Protocol
	- Concept: Grounded Philosophy
	- Concept: The Praxis Clash
> They seemed more appropriate here, and DocPass is due for a large-scale revision sometime soon.

### Expansions
- Expanded on 'Technique Collapse' in [[Extended Disciplines]]
> Wasn't satisfied with the launch version of this, so it's been expanded upon.

## 26/06/24 - U24dot1 Initial Launch
- Expanded Project Samsara in a manner previously unseen.
- Diligent recording of patch notes begins.
