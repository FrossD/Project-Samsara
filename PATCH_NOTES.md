# Project Samsara Patch Notes
The patch notes for Project Samsara.

This document is arranged such that newer patches and their notes appear at the top. Refer to these patches when new updates drop to stay up to date with the Samsara canon.

## 02/07/24 - dot1.1
The first post launch patch. Some clean-ups stemming from feedback following launch, and new and expanded writ.

### Additions
- Added the revision of Armor to [[Weave and Warfare]]
> I somehow forgot I revised this and didn't ship it with U24dot1; my bad.
- Added writ on the 'Tomic Stomp' to [[Extended Disciplines]]
> Sup Blakk.
- Added the entry on 'Recurve Strafers' to [[SB_Technology]]
> We have hoverboards now.

### Revisions
- Fixed a number of grammatical and punctuation errors.
> Thanks Mel.

### Migrations
- Moved the following headings from [[The Doctrine of Passing]] to [[Family Addendums]];
	- Concept: The Social Implications of the strider Protocol
	- Concept: Grounded Philosophy
	- Concept: The Praxis Clash
> They seemed more appropriate here, and DocPass is due for a large-scale revision sometime soon.

### Expansions
- Expanded on 'Technique Collapse' in [[Extended Disciplines]]
> Wasn't satisfied with the launch version of this, so it's been expanded upon.

## 26/06/24 - U24dot1 Initial Launch
- Expanded Project Samsara in a manner previously unseen.
- Diligent recording of patch notes begins.
