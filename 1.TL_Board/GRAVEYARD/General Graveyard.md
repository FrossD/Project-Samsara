## Hands Chalk

#### Utilization of the Five Straits
A Weaver can produce fire from wood by drawing five concentric Chalk circles around it; the potential, interpreter, memory, computational and interface. The interface line observes the wood, sending a breakdown of information the Weaver feels will be necessary for his next steps. The computational line takes numbers from the interpreter and a equation from the memory, specifically one that finds how many joules of energy must be supplied to the wood to produce a certain change in temperature. This number is acquired and sent to the interface line, which draws the energy by folding latent chalk, and supplies it to the wood, inducing heat, and creating fire.

Taken further, a Weaver can create a simple camera by drawing a series of concentric circles around the rim of a cup and pointing it at something to be photographed. The interface line is instructed to begin measuring the hexadecimal color values of everything in an arc in front of it, sending these values to a series of computational lines, that stitch the hexadecimal values one after the other in small squares, creating pixels. Adjustments can be made by other computational lines, such as formula that produces a greyscale filter. The resulting series of pixels is sent to the memory line to be stored. It can be output by drawing all five lines in a rectangle, the image being projected in the space created.

### How the Five Straits Works
Information pulled in from the interface line is sent to the potential line, this being the act of accumulating chalk. If this information isn't pure randomness, that is deduced by the interpreter line, with purely random chalk staying back in the potential line. Non-random chalk - chalk with 'pattern' - is sent to the memory line for storage and computational lines for processing where necessary. Any change made is imparted upon the outside world using the interface line once again.

But the true purpose of the Weave Protocol is the usage of Equations. A Switchboard Equation is - most simply put - a set of instructions for weaving ribbons of chalk, to form patterns. As mentioned above, these equations (or rather knowledge of them) are kept in the Memory Line, and computation using them is done in the Computational Line. The results of these calculations are output by the Interface Line. This is the means by which Weaver's interact deeply with the Switchboard.
