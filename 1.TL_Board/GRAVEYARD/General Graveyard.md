## Hands Chalk

#### Utilization of the Five Straits
A Weaver can produce fire from wood by drawing five concentric Chalk circles around it; the potential, interpreter, memory, computational and interface. The interface line observes the wood, sending a breakdown of information the Weaver feels will be necessary for his next steps. The computational line takes numbers from the interpreter and a equation from the memory, specifically one that finds how many joules of energy must be supplied to the wood to produce a certain change in temperature. This number is acquired and sent to the interface line, which draws the energy by folding latent chalk, and supplies it to the wood, inducing heat, and creating fire.

Taken further, a Weaver can create a simple camera by drawing a series of concentric circles around the rim of a cup and pointing it at something to be photographed. The interface line is instructed to begin measuring the hexadecimal color values of everything in an arc in front of it, sending these values to a series of computational lines, that stitch the hexadecimal values one after the other in small squares, creating pixels. Adjustments can be made by other computational lines, such as formula that produces a greyscale filter. The resulting series of pixels is sent to the memory line to be stored. It can be output by drawing all five lines in a rectangle, the image being projected in the space created.

### How the Five Straits Works
Information pulled in from the interface line is sent to the potential line, this being the act of accumulating chalk. If this information isn't pure randomness, that is deduced by the interpreter line, with purely random chalk staying back in the potential line. Non-random chalk - chalk with 'pattern' - is sent to the memory line for storage and computational lines for processing where necessary. Any change made is imparted upon the outside world using the interface line once again.

But the true purpose of the Weave Protocol is the usage of Equations. A Switchboard Equation is - most simply put - a set of instructions for weaving ribbons of chalk, to form patterns. As mentioned above, these equations (or rather knowledge of them) are kept in the Memory Line, and computation using them is done in the Computational Line. The results of these calculations are output by the Interface Line. This is the means by which Weaver's interact deeply with the Switchboard.

### Old reading guide
## Getting Down to Business
**THIS READING GUIDE IS OUT OF DATE AS 15/12/2023. AN UPDATED READING GUIDE IS IN THE WORKS.**

If you are looking to read Samsara and don't where to start, I took the liberty of making a somewhat-workable **read order**. 

1. **The Primers**; absolute essentials to getting a firm grip on the Samsara universe.
   - The Switchboard
   - The Grand Mechanica
   - The Blank-Slate Mind
   - The Hands as Chalk
   - The Strider Protocol

2. **The Mechanical Pillars**; another large chunk of worldbuilding, bringing in new concepts that build off of the old.
   - The Skywards Pursuit
   - The Relics of New
   - The Cyclicality of Names
   - The Void
   - Glass

3. **The Narrative Worldbuilding**; further worldbuilding, that seeks to explore more of the Samsara universe beyond cold mechanica
   - The Early Switchboard
   - Strider Descendance
   - The Voice in Flowers
   - Strider Ritualism
   - On Weave and Warfare
   - Switchboard Technology
   - The Lattice as a Canvas
   - The Doctrine of Passing

4. **Further Reading**; various rough documents used in the creation of the Samsara Project, that may shed light on other documents as well as our design processes.
   - The Axle of Axles (if you didn't wholly grasp The Grand Mechanica and The Blank-Slate Mind)
   - The Bayesian Slate-Mind (Further discussion on The Blank-Slate Mind)
   - LatCanvasHex (a document that served as a precursor to the Lattice as a Canvas and parts of it adapted into the Grand Mechanica and The Blank-Slate Mind)
   - Horological Nomenclature (relates to a section in The Early Switchboard on developing and naming measures of time)
   - Post-BS1 Notes and Post-BS1 Cryogen's Response (a long series of docs that record the results of a community brainstorming session, touching on a long list of Samsara concepts)

It's worth mentioning however, that Samsara is tens of thousands of words of worldbuilding, and the full picture isn't even obtainable by reading all that. Ideally, you should make it an aim to read as many docs as possible, using the in-file Obsidian hyperlinks to navigate between relevant topics.
