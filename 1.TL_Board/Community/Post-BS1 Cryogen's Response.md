# Post-BS1 and the road to InfoConsol
We'll go section by section as we did with the first major community discussion prompted majorly by Doctor Hex (internally known as Hex's Post OctExpan Questioning).

'InfoConsol' is Information Consolidation, in which we look over early every document relating to Information-as-a-system, and as a natural extension, Chalk-as-a-power. These docs are primarily Information Tangibility and [[The Blank-Slate Mind]](SlateMind). Taken further, look-overs of these docs will prompt creation of the second iteration of [[The Hands as Chalk]](HandChalk), reaching the final form of Chalk-as-a-power. Understanding of Chalk will then allow me to begin work on Rituals and Equations, a doc you aren't currently privy to. We might also take another look at [[The Void]] and [[SB_Astromechanics]](SBAstro).

All of these are necessary to then create InfoConsol, the final shape of information-as-a-system, likely to make SlateMind it's domain as opposed to elements of it being scattered across multiple docs.

Let's begin then with the Post-BS1 notes.

# Post-BS1 Analysis
## 1. Time Manipulation
**Excerpts from Switchboard Physics Approximates Baseline**
>The distortion around a neutron star is about 1 extra second per every 4 seconds, i.e. a person on Earth ages 5 seconds while a person on the surface of a neutron star ages only 4 seconds.

>A 1 second combat advantage could definitely tip the scales in a fight, but would require gravity comparable to a neutron star. This is then a planet-destroying power, next to which the 1 second advantage is utterly meaningless.

>Could you balance out the gravity without affecting the time? No, because gravity ***is*** *curvature of spacetime*. If the space is curved (causing immense pressures), then the time is necessarily curved; these cannot be decoupled from each other.

>However, we can consider changing the *strength* of the coupling.

**Excerpts from SB Physics varies considerably from Baseline**
>Now suppose we alter the coupling constants in the Switchboard so that (for example) a person in 1.5x gravity ages four seconds while a person in 1x gravity ages 5 seconds. Time manipulation is now feasible.

>The issue is that stars now distort time on a bonkers scale. A Strider using local curvature to bend their trajectory could age one year while their destination ages centuries.

	We are presented with a very interesting consequence of the nature of the Switchoard and narrative at large. The entire discussion of Time Manip. stems from the fact VS-Combat works primarily off of localized curvature manipulation, which induces gravity - and subsequently - alters the flow of time. 

	In one scenario, time manip. is possible but requires the Depthstrider equivalent of power equalling that of a neutron star, for brely any time manip. at all. A bonus second every four seconds, even if a genuis Depthstrider could exploit that one second for all it's worth, would be genius enough to realize there is no problem where being able to seize a bonus second fro thin air would be better than the overwheling power presented by the equivalent curvature induced to make it. Why be tactical when even being tactical first requires using overwhelming brute force? It is an unusable scenario.

	The second scenario is far more feasible but presents it's own issues. Alter the coupling constant. Time manipulation is now feasible. The problem you then face is armillary stars, which distort time beyond what is narratively tenable. There are further issues too. A Depthstrider in combat will be rapidly distorting time, even more so as they up their output. Another issue is planets, though maybe it isn't. Planets have their own gravity created by their information mass, meaning they too should distort time. By how much? There needs to be an established ratio between amount of gravity and amount of distortion, and this ratio needs to make sense in both combative and cosmological contexts.

	To elaborate, suppose I as a Depthstrider create a curvature point in space that accelerates things towards it at the same rate as the very planet we're standing on. The resultant of the forces is zero, meaning no movement takes place. To overcome this, I need to pull harder than the planet itself. Will Depthstriders be able to distort time more significantly than planets? Even if constrained to localized regions? Wouldn't I as a Depthstrider, find out the most effective means of combat is to induce an amount of curvature and subsequent temporal distortion so great that I simply rapidly age my opponenets into early graves?

	As it stands, neither scenario is workable. What then are our ways forward? There are two.

	One is obvious; authorial powers. The coupling constant is now no longer a constant. Like the top speed of the USS Enterprise, it is whatever number that is needed by the plot. Depthstriders in combat can distort gravity as much as they wish without growing beards as they do, except when they suddenly want to distort time, in which they suddenly can. It is underhanded, unimpressive, and would absolutely work.

	The second is simply scrapping the idea, except this too is authorial powers. You cannot have gravity without time manipulation, unless we then say the coupling constant is equal or lower to that of the Baseline's, such that - as described in scenario one - you'd need the power of a neutron star to produce significant distortion. 
	
	From a reader's standpoint however, this isn't possible to adequately protray as a sign of strength. I tell the scientifically illiterate, 'this character has the power of a bloody neutron star' and they'll think, 'hot dog that's crazy' until I then tell them it allows them to get one free second every four. They're far more likely to be impressed if I tell them the power of a neutron star allows them to flatten planets. Tactics do not necessarily beat brute force.

>As I write this however, a third option arises. Time Manipulation is something I always wanted to be the domain of Void *Drifters* alone, but I was left unsure of how this would be done. A solution is that the powers of the Drift Protocol is editing the coupling constant. All of the Switchboard is subject to a global coupling constant that means immense gravity distortion is needed to produce a minute amount of time distortion. Void Drifters, however, could simply modify the localized coupling constant, and produce immense temporal distortion using very little gravity distortion.

	These are the best ideas I've had, on to the next section.


## 2. and 3., Measuring Power and Instruments
>If the power of a strider is proportional to the knowledge they possess (see below for further discussion on this), then it is also related to their gravity. This suggests that measuring the gravitational field around a Strider with very sensitive equipment would measure their power.

>One suggestion is to use an **optical lattice clock**, which is sensitive to measure the time distortion of a 1 meter height difference on Earth.

	Little to say here. I had no idea such an instrument existed and now that I know it does I am elated. It will absolutely make it into the canon in some form (there's an "It's over nine thousand!!" joke waiting to be made here I can feel it). 

>A measuring instrument in the Baseline is essentially a device that reveals an equation. This suggests that in the Switchboard, measuring devices are responsible for Teks.

>An example of a naturally occuring measuring device would be a stream that results in a parabolic flow of water. An intelligent Strider would recognize the shape of the water as a parabola, and thereby gain power from knowing this equation.

	This here though I don't understand. Two things are unfortunately missing here; the bit I just wrote that elaborates on finding Teks, and what specifically an 'equation' is. The latter is going to be answered in a doc that will - as mentioned above - will be created post HandChalk 2.0.

	I kind of undertand what is being said though. To explain briefly, a Switchboard equation takes in Chalk and outputs Chalk that is patterned, equal in information mass, but - because it is patterend - different. A Switchboard equation is like a pizza oven, or a car factory, in that the sum of what comes in and what goes out are equal in the sense nothing is being sneakily added in the middle of the process, but a finished pizza or an assembled car is far more useful and valuable to us than a pile of ingredients or car parts.

	This will be elaborated upon more, later.

	Referring back to the parabolic water stream, you can say that an equation is indeed what makes a stream of ejected water curve at a calculae gradient back down to the earth, and in a way it is a decent analogue for a Switchboard equation, though lacking in the essential 'shaping, patterning, assembling' aspects of it.

	The point on differences between naturally and artificial measuring devices has confused me even further. We'll need further discussion on that.

## 4. Knowledge, Desire and Power Interplay
### Power and Desire
	This here is a fun one, and perhaps the core of what will become Infodynamics. I think as a real tl:dr I can say yeah, the Gompertz curve is the only narratively feasible model of the relationship betwen Power granted by Knowing and Power created as a result of Desire.

	An extension of this is that power of secrecy described in the Blank-Slate Mind, and why InfoConsol is so important. We work towards the final shape of informaion-as-a-system, and once we define all these parts and combine them, we'll have a final, unbreakable doctrine.

	There's no need to pull any excerpts. This section proposes the Gompertz curve and that's what we'll use. It's the only thing that's narratively feasible. We however still have work to do. We must define some definite (definite enough) numbers for how man people desiring a thng produces how much power. This I believe requires us to get a fair idea of how many people exist in the Switchboard, which falls more under Narrative Worldbuilding. 

	Alternatively, we bullshit it with authorial powers. A piece of information is powerful because enough people want to know about it. Who are these people? Where are they? Stop asking questions.

### Power and Knowledge
	Now this. This is fucking gold.

	Most of the Switchboard's mechanics are wheels rotating on central axles. All these continued reworks, all the back and forth, are attempts to adequately define those axles into existence. An example is the Void. All things Void hinge on the two-pronged qualities of depth and curvature. All other things are auxiliary. It is the exact same here, seperating the quality and quantity of 'information' and seeing how things hinge on this.

	Switchboard Knowledge and Switchboard Power. Quantity and quality. And information combines all four. It is pure perfection.

>There would be such a thing as "garbage information" that you can accumulate a lot of, but does not significantly raise your power level.

	This is an example of a problem I ran into but could not devise a fix too. Suppose a Strider had a book with a small computer and printer built into front cover. The computer continually generates random numbers, which the printer then prints as pages of the book. The Strider then asks someone else what is the sequence of numbers in the book. Mechanics immediately come into play, the first being desire for an unknown answer immediately creating power in those who knw the answer, and the second being that the larger the quantity of the unknown answer, the larger the power provided to those who know it. Effectively, this singular book would grant infinite power. This could not be. It is as put, 'garbage information'.

	This seperation of information into knowledge and power solves this. Yes, the book will become decently information dense over eons of printing, but knowing it's contents will not make you much stronger if no one else desires what's in that book as well. You can publicize the book to get even more people desiring what's in the book, but depending on the tuning of the Gompertz curve, it could take a while before you have enough people desiring the contents of the book before you get significant power dividends.

	Another example. A phonebook of names, though having plenty of information in it, won't provide as much power when known compared to , say, the name of a wanted serial murderer.

	I'm tackling this section very out of order. Let's talk information mass and subsequently, informatio density. 'Information' is a product of Sb-Know and Sb-Power, meaning that if any of these is raised or lowered, it affects information density. This is perfect. Packing more information in a location raises density and curvature (the power of VS-Striders basically). More people desiring that information raises the Sb-Power gained when it is learned. It becomes 'weightier'. Somehow this relates to the Super Regions, but in what way, I am unsure.

	Density has to be a product of some fomula that combines Sb-Know and Sb-Power ideally. Packing information reates density yes, but it would be preferrable if the significance of that information produces greater density. In the case of Striders, knowing more powerful things should be a greater power than knowing lots of things.

	More powerful information, and larger quantities of information produce more warp. They curve the Switchboard further. Think of a planet. It's sheer planatery size and it being made of information is already suffificent enough to justify how much it warps space-time, and then you can add the desire held towards that planet; the nature of it's planetary equation, where some things on it are located, even if it will rain tomorrow. Vaults are much smaller than planets, but will also warp space-time considerably, because of the sheer desire held towards them and their contents, increasing their Sb-Power and information mass and density. It is a brilliant system.

	And it only gets even more brilliant when you look at it from the philosophy of Striding. Striders are seekers, but how do you know where to seek? You Stride, but how do you know where to go? Everything worth finding, worth knowing, exerts a pull via it's distrotion of space-time. Valuable information quite literally pulls Striders towards it. It is pure brilliance.

	As a note, I will have to write a section on blanket or umbrella desires, in which desiring one thing can actually result in also desiring something distinct but fairly inseperable from it, as well as desiring something may actually be desiring a much larger collection of similar things. More elaboration on this later.

## 5. Metainformation
> Logically the answer should be yes, but to avoid a feedback loop (does knowing that people know that people know that people know that people...) each layer of metaknowledge should grant less and less power.

	No objections.

## 6. Truth and Probability
	Bayesian probability. Very scary and powerful. Delving deeply into this section is a herculean undertaking. Instead, we will take the question asked, and the answer given, and run with that as our core mechanics.

> "Does knowing something that happens to be false grant power?"

> Narratively, we want to avoid a situation where lies or deceit are impossible. If I can measure the truth of a statement by whether it grants power or not, then no one can lie to me. This is not desired story-wise.

> "what difference is there in knowing the future vs. knowing the past or present?" or, "How certain can we be of events that have 'already happened' ?"

	Contained above are the questions, let us then get the answers.

	Adapting and interpreting Hex's example of three people being asked if it will rain the next day (I highly recommend reading this section in full), I derive something that goes like this;

	Three people are asked if it will rain the next day. A ignores all things around them and guesses, B observes nature (clouds, the fact it hasn't rained recently, nearness of water bodies, the fact it's spring, etc.) and makes a guess, and C is a Strider responsible for mainitaing the planetary equation, and they know from the planetary equation that ran tomorrow is nigh guranteed.

	The first qustion we must ask in deciding who's guess makes them more powerful is how Bayesian each guesser is being. Bayesianity in this context (as I understand it, again, I'm pretty darn new to this shit) is attempting to form an idea of probability or likeliness based on analyzing available information.

	A - for example - can be a raging narcissist, wholly convinced of their own infalliability, and declare with absolute certainty that it will rain tomorrow. However, by assigning a value of 1 to probability, they are being as anti-Bayesian as it gets, and because they are randomly guessing, that certainty grants no power.

	The second person (B) employs more Bayesian methods of studying the environment, and makes a guess that - because they sourced more information before making it - makes it a better guess than A's.

	C, the third, has access to even more information - arguably the only information *that* actually matters - and thus their guess is worht more than B's, and far more than A's.

	Where does that leave us?

	Bayesianity as I see it comes down to efficient use of information that's available to work towards guesses. It is why certainty isn't what produces the power from guesses. C who has the most information, may reach a probabilty far lower than A's, but C used their information more efficiently, unlike A who didn't even try. This is what produces the power.

	It comes down to differentiating between certianty about something and certainty about your *certainty* itself. What methods did you use to reach that certainty? That is what produces the power from both knowing something that is false, and knowing of something that has not happened yet/will happe in te future. I need the good doctor tot take a good look at this paragraph to ensure I'm on the right track.

	Summarized, power is weakly proportional to previously held knowledge, and strongly proportional to how efficiently that information is used to arrive at a guess. Efficiently using information requires having that information in the first place, thus meaning one feeds into the other.

# Closing
The first major step towards InfoConsol has been taken. Here we bloody go.
