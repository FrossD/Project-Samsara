# Blakk's Inquisition
The responses to Blakk's questions after reading Samsara.

> Like, for a start, why does the Astrolabe have leap years? Leap years only exist because the duration of a day does not divide into the duration of a year exactly. 
> But if all the measures of the Astrolabe are multiples of a single time measure, there's no reason they would exist.

	Old canon. Removed.

>Also, it says that the Challenger Dark's curvature saps the momentum of Striders. (Skywards Pursuit) 
If we presume the Void's pull is analogous to a gravitational field, this should technically depend on where the Strider is in comparison to the void.
As in, if the Void is between the Strider and their destination, then the pull of the Void would be in the direction of Striding, and the Void would speed them up, not slow them down.
There's another question I want to ask, but I'll read the entry on the Void first.

	Quoting the actual doc on the Void;

> The imperfect nature of the Void can also be exploited by particularly proficient Striders to perform deft maneuvers during the Stride, described best as skipping a stone to reach the edge of a whirlpool, bending it from it's initial path to reach another shore.

	Correct, the Void would speed them up based on their position

>Also, another thing, in the regions, are emergent properties a thing? (Skywards Pursuit) (edited)
>I find it a little hard to believe every single one of every single property that exists within the region is governed by its own equation that do not interact with each other in any way.

	I don't really understand the question, but here goes.

	I'm guessing the question is asking; suppose three equations, one controls wind patterns, one controls rain frequency, one controls sunlight distribution, do these equations interact in a manner that produces additional properties? What would these properties be? The model for a regional equation is a box of gears, each gear controls something that dictates the nature of the region. Nothing needs to 'emerge' from the interactions of these gears as everything that *could* is already governed by aforementioned gears.

> Also, if all the memories of a Strider is packed onto a ribbon, and ribbons are folded to create objects, is it then possible to fold the memory of something into that thing? (The Hands As Chalk)

	As chalk works now, anything can be unwoven using the right equation, and refolded into something else using another equation. I could fold my arm into a leg if I had the right equations.

> A barrier or membrane, around the regions...
While you say that the anchorage superstructures keep the region equation themselves stable, I like to think more that they simply keep the surrounding membrane intact. 
In their absence, the pull of the Void rips the region apart.
(Skyward Pursuit)
Otherwise it'd be pretty hard to explain why regional equations need a link to the Wellspring, but absolutely nothing else does.
Also, do regions move in respect to each other?

	Anchorage superstructures connecting the Wellsprings to the regional equation of a region descended from it are what keeps the region intact. The regional equation also maintains the membrane that keeps the region - again - intact. 

	I don't see why there's an issue with regions needing links to Wellsprings when nothing else does. Regions are descended *from* the Wellsprings. It is designed that way and I think it is more than fine.

> Also, quick question: You mentioned in (Information Tangibility) that all qualities of something are intrinsic.
This raises several issues.
Specifically, ones of emergent properties.
What defines something as something? For example, if I slice a water bottle in half, does it reflect on the information of the two halves that it is different from a complete bottle? And how?
Then, what if they were made in two halves so they were never one complete bottle?
Also, at what point does the intrinsicness stop?
If I place a pencil in a room, is it considered just a pencil or a part of the room? 
What about the whole building? The whole country? The whole world?
And in reverse, how does the instricness know it is part of a pencil and not just some block of wood?
How does an iron filing taken off a pan know it is not an iron filing taken off a pot?
After all, it makes no sense that the boundaries of distinction defined by the Switchboard, a supernatural construct, just so happens to lie at the level most convenient for humans.
(The Blank Slate Mind)
In short, if the properties of a system affects its components, then we really need to define "components".

	I have two answers to this.

	The first is that this is delving into pedantry. Pedantry is good, but it's also crippling. We might as well solve the problem of consciousness while we're at it. Information Tangibility does drive nearly everything that works in the universe, but those things that it drives can be understood without having so firm a grasp on InfoTang, or InfoTang itself even being that well thought-out. What I'm saying is that we can puzzle this, but it will be done more to say InfoTang as it stands alone, in a vacuum, is sensible - rather than serving to improve the functionality of everything that hinges on it as narrative elements.

	My second answer is the SlateMind is getting a rewrite according to principles that will make it and InfoTang make a lot more sense. Hex is handling things on that front, as it concerns a certain concept that I am only gradually grasping. With that said, I ask that you simply wait for the SlateMind rewrite.

> I'm reading (Bayesian Slate Mind), and it seems somewhat to me that the quality of information can be measured by asking "how many questions would this information answer?"
Just like how the quality of energy is determined by how much work it can do.
Heat is considered low quality energy as its disorderliness means it cannot be channeled into doing much work. As such, strings of random numbers are low quality information as they cannot be channeled into answering many questions or building strait lines.
And, as such, false information is filtered out, as only true information can be used to in the Weave protocol to give chalk lines that produce useful results.
In short, inaccuracy is exposed at the point where knowledge meets reality. While there's absolutely nothing stopping a Strider in knowing something false, once they actually try to use that information, they'll realize quick that they've been lied to. 
As such, it is sound Strider sense to test all information they are told before accepting it as fact.

	This looks like something that the SlateMind rewrite will address.

> What does a powerful Strider look like, especially in comparison to a not powerful one?
How exactly does having highly desirable information manifest?
Like, does it make them able to throw harder punches, or what?
Also, how does any Strider survive Striding? Flying at near light speed through the Void might be fine, but once you get near something...
Plus, how do they launch in the first place? They can't do it on the surface of a planet; they'll be torn to bits, not to mention the effects on the planet.
You say they can discard speed by turning it into heat. But that'll probably kill them, so...

	I don't imagine a strong Strider 'looks' that different from a weak one. I don't see why they would. As for how it manifests, having information that is desired does provide what is - egregiously simply put - an almost numerical multiplier to a Strider's strength. Knowing things does indeed make a Strider powerful in the way being muscular or swift does.

	Striders survive Striding because Striding is survivable. That's all there is to it. The SProt grants the power to Stride as well as the means to survive all that Striding brings. I encourage you to reread the SProt document again. I don't see why doing it on a region (planet) would 'tear them to bits' or have any effect on the planet. As well as the point on discarding speed as heat killing them.

	Something I encourage you to remember is that we are building a fictional universe. Your question of "Why doesn't the Strider Protocol obey Newton's Third Law, Thermodynamics or all the other things that plague near-light-speed travel?" is just one door down from "Why is the Strider Protocol a thing?" It is a thing because the story needs it, and the story needs it to be a certain way for it to serve as optimally as a narrative element. We once again reach the issue of pedantry. We could go back and forth to reach a 100% realized physics-accurate version of the SProt, as soon you can tell me how that positively affects the story.
