### Speculative Antag: Russel Walls
Russel Walls' story is that of a man faced with the imperfections of being a human being, seeks to evolve beyond the limits of human existence. 

The story begins with him working a fairly mundane job, maybe some kind of elementary Psychitecture or maybe even something even less impressive than that. He does it to fund his studies towards being a 'bio-mechanist'; a doctor specializing in using esoteric technology to heal, made possible with his powers as a Strider. 

He practices medicine illegally in the secluded depths of Freesia, helping people unable to pay the prices at regular hospitals. He runs the entire operation himself; sourcing materials, prepping the rituals, carrying them out and out-patient care. He's become a loved figure in that regard as he's helped a fair number of people. 

Something happens that leads to him being betrayed to the authorities, which then shut down his operation and bring him in for questioning and eventual punishment. He's however bailed out by a shadow figure who then wants to meet him.

	As regards the betrayal, it has to be something fairly feasible/realistic. Currently unsure what someone like Walls could've done to elicit being betrayed. Remains to be seen.

The shadow figure is fundamentally the precursor to a cult leader; wealthy, a recluse, and with larger than life ambitions and ideals on how to improve the human condition. He brings on Russel Walls as he believes they share a similar aim; uplifting people from the constraints presented by their biology.

	This 'wealthy sponsor' character is a manipulator aiming to use Walls for his own ends. What those ends are are unclear to me currently. 'Uplifting Mankind' is serviceable, but I want something more.

He begins his doctor duties again, aided by a wealthy sponsor and finds fulfillment in serving and healing humanity. He eventually finds something close to love/companionship and things are going fairly well for him. Then disaster. Unsure the current shape and form of it, except that it is cataclysmic, and leads to the realization that it is not enough to merely fix broken limbs, and that human nature itself is fundamentally flawed by nature of being flesh subject to chemicals, producing irrationality.

	The running idea is that he;
	1. Falls in love with someone
	2. They die in an accident caused by human error
	   
	It feels somewhat cliche without me having seen/read any media that as done this before. The logic follows; the dots connect, but something is somewhat off about what is fundamentally "My best friend slipped on a spill and now all of mankind must reject their flesh and evolve."
	
	There's the aspect of the wealthy sponsor manipulating him of course. Irrational decisions/conclusions are made more believable/plausible when influenced by outside, biased stimuli. Something like W. Sponsor telling a story of somethng similar that happened to him driving Walls to his conclusion is logical.

He seeks revenge against the cause of the disaster, which is human in nature, and when confronting the perpetrator on their imperfections, he too realizes that he himself is imperfect flesh. He sets about rectify this through 'Subjugation', a series of rituals and body modifications he and his mentor create to hone him into a 'cleansing blade'.

	This is a pivotal moment in the the story of Russel Walls and what sets him down the path of antagonist.
	
	As understandable as his anguish is, killing people is bad, and generaly, doing it is something you don't come back from. What's truly pivotal however, is W. Sponsor pointing out that Walls himself is not much different from the person he killed. It's Walls realizing this that eventually leads him down the path of aiming to become perfect; becoming machine.
	
	His methodology for doing so is biohacking, cybernetics, nanotechnology and Switchboard Ritualism. He creates his own ritualism of Subjugation; basically inflicting systematic pain on himself as a means to subdue his flesh.
	
	I don't know if around this point he should don the porcelin mask that will basically be the calling card of his character. The symbology of the mask is his final divorce from his humanity, and while this is a point where that divorce begins, it may not necessarily be the point at which he plunges into the metaphorical deep end.

He begins research into deeper Strider Ritualism, and realizes that the Legislation Protocol is a means to achieve his goal. To begin his tests, he leaves New Valkyjria to a Switchboard city that has both an Academy, and a Wellspring (placeholder name for the regions where laws are appended to the Switchboard). He enlists the help of militia groups in the Fringe with the help of his wealthy sponsor who eggs him on, and captures the city and its Wellspring. In it, he begins drafting his Law, as the militia holds the city from Academy forces.

	This is a literal war arc. A small war arc, but a war arc nonetheless. 
	
	Being a War Arc, it's got a bunch of moving parts that must all mesh together like clockwork. The foremost is how realistic it is for two men to engineer a siege on a Spheric City. As an idea though, it need not be a whole other city, but rather just Freesia in New Valkyjria. No reason to get another city involved, plus Walls has a connection to the place.

In creating his Law he encounters difficulties, and studies to find a path towards his goal. He decides he must embrace the Mysticism and sets out to raid a vault/data fortress. As Ventura is one of the last few Striders who survived direct conflict with Strider Mystics, he's deployed to intercept and stop Walls in his endeavor, but fails. ^645c7c

Walls meets the Witch of Gates, and becomes the Strider Exalted. 

With his newly acquired power he completes his Law and deploys it city-wide, morphing Striders and non-striders alike into entities of shattered mathematics and Mysticism. 


## Deprecated Plotlines
### A Theoretical Arc One
A theoretical arc one would begin with Ventura and Protag2 meeting up and end with resolving the conflict happening at the outskirts of the Switchboard in the form of a destabilizing power.

Most of the characters are from Ventura's class so we gotta dev those. V's class teaches something similar to Elodin's 'naming' in that the class is barely structured and the material is barely understood but the real purpose of what they learn will be revealed in time. 

Protag2 comes to Ventura after reviewing his file on how he used to be a former member of a Anti-Arcana and how they took down the Mystics. She means to use his knowledge as a former MTF to form one of her own and go after the threat.

Intermediary party of Lucrecia acting as their distributor for black market and less than savory elements. Probably supports elimination of the threat as well for her own gain. 

Ventura loses his power to Strider some time in Act 2 as punishment for raiding an Anti Arcana facility for gear to form their MTF.

### Events (Skeletal) (Heavily Deprecated)
**Act One**
Protag2 and Ventura meet up advancing to the death of a member of Ventura's class.

**Act Two**
Forming the MTF and gearing up to go to the Stacks.

**Act Three**
Attack on the Stacks.

	Heavy deprecation. Russel Walls plot alone renders mst of this outdated.
