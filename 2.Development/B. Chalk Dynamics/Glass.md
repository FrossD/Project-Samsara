# Glass
Glass is an esoteric, physical phenomenon in the Switchboard that manifests in the form of a brilliant, crystalline, translucent solid, both taking and holding a jagged edge, while scattering light that passes through it, giving it the appearance of a splendidly-cut gemstone. Originating from its birthplace - the Vitric Shelf, which in turn arose by rather unusual means - very little about its workings are truly understood, other than the manner in which it interacts with all things calcic.

Glass' most noteworthy property is that chalk cannot abide it; it is caustic to chalk in any and all forms. In utterly inexplicable fashion, any chalk that comes in contact with glass, should the conditions be right, is systematically frayed and torn at the very seams, shredded as though by microscopic hands within and without, unwinding and unravelling in a manner wholly dissimilar to how these are understood, only to re-stitch the chalk that falls prey to it into an entirely novel form; still calcic, but skewed in a manner that differs holistically from what it once was, adopting a new manner that grates at the senses and the world around it.

In a sense, glass *perfects*. It takes all forms of chalkweave and sees to it that they are seized up in both arms, and elegantly ferried to state that approximates their final shape. In this process, whatever that weave once was is 'destroyed', in that there is a discrepancy in its ontology with regards to the contexts of 'then' and 'now'. But glass does not 'destroy'; we interpret what it does as destruction but it is far from it. glass *ascends* what is subjected to it, and it is more so a remark upon us than upon glass itself that we find the final result of this ascension work, horrifying. 

## Origin
All glass that there is originates from the Vitric Shelf, a locale of the Switchboard similar to Isalveh, the Challenger Dark, in that it occupies the fourth spatial dimension, this time being situated opposing the Void; 'upwards'. Transiting to and from the Vitric Shelf is thus achievable through curvature manipulation, but the sheer distance between the Shelf and the Dancirah - or rather, the prohibitive thickness of the boundary between them - has made it such that transit to the Shelf requires an amount of distortion of space that is simply not doable by even legendarily talented Void-wielders. Travel to the Vitric Shelf is thus more traditionally done via the usage of the **jaws**, which are elaborated upon further onwards.

The origin of the Vitric Shelf itself however - as it did not exist in earliest Switchboard, similar to the Challenger Dark - is detailed in [[The Dawn of the Dancirah]]. During the First Praxis War, the First Thinkers - more specifically, the Eradication Imperative - made use of a [[Chalk Ritualism#Ledgerial Casts|ledgerial cast]] to deceive the Astrolabe into being convinced of the impending annihilation of the Switchboard as a result of chalk itself, causing it to under a Resolution and yield its functional antithesis in the form of Glass. All glass was confined to the Vitric Shelf above the Great Sky, and the Imperative used induced weak-points in the boundary between the Sky and the Shelf to deploy **jaws**, a poignant feat of curvature manipulation that resulted in rift-like tears in local space, through which glass could be passed through and used to attack anything nearby.

As such, all glass that exists originates from the initial load created when an Astrolabic Resolution birthed the Vitric Shelf, many, many processions into the past, just about around the time the Third Kin arose.

## Negentropy
The more technical term for the behavior or properties glass exhibits is **negentropy**. Chalk - in a sense, emblematic of the chaotic and complex - is attacked and simplified, regularized, indexed and ordered by the influence of glass, dismantling and reforming it as a less entropic iteration upon itself. 

This opposition to entropy is immensely problematic to the various calcic phenomena in the Switchboard, as even the mild influence of glass is enough to considerably disrupt various forms of chalkweave, rendering all manners of calcic constructs - from relics to rituals - wholly inoperable and no longer what they once were. Where it gets particularly dire, is that glass is incredibly undiscerning, and even the lattices and straits of thinking weave including - *especially* - the Third Kin, are immensely vulnerable to this perfecting influence. Ripping through the lattice and straits, tearing them apart and reweaving them into perfected versions of themselves, glass is almost always a slow, painful, inescapable death to the many denizens of the Switchboard.

Glass is thus at war with existence itself. Where the mechanics of the Switchboard are constantly yielding greater and greater complexities in all things, glass opposes this doctrine, striking out and rebuilding the Switchboard in accordance with its own principles. From our perception, glass is a phenomenon that's malevolent in its doings, though this perception stems entirely from our being entropic beings.

## Opposing Glass
Glass is very dimensional in how it exists and acts. Leave chalk near - even in contact with - glass, and odds are good that very little will actually occur. But should enough glass be incident upon a measure of chalkweave, it will begin to act and do so rapidly. Often, the easiest way to do this is by cutting through a given bit of chalkweave, exposing a large cross-section of ribbon to the jagged, perfecting edge. Transformation is swift, though dependent, again, on numerous factors, such as the amount of glass available.

As mentioned above, glass is very undiscerning in how it perfects, attacking weft belonging to a stone and a thinking being much the same way. Much of the difference in the final outcome of glass' attack on thinking weave, however, such as the Third Kin, is dependent on the fact the Kin have an inbuilt defense mechanism against various phenomenon, which - miraculously, though not by design - includes Glass.

This defense mechanism is their passive [[SB_Physiology#Damage Recovery|reverse unravelling]] and by extension [[Extended Disciplines#Reverse Unravelling Techniques|reverse unravelling techniques]]. In an instance where the perfecting influence of glass doesn't outstrip the passive or active reverse unravelling applied to the area of glass' incidence - outstripping in this case being a match of speed versus speed - it is entirely possible for a Third Kin or other beings in the Switchboard to 'out-heal' the encroaching 'damage' caused by glass, followed by physically purging the incident glass material from the lattice.

How viable this is a defensive mechanism is of course, a game of numbers. How much glass is in contact with the lattice? How pure is the glass? What part of the lattice is under attack? How fast is the passive/active reverse unravelling? How complex is the subject's lattice? What truly counts as 'having defended against Glass'? The last question is a particularly important one, as it is possible to survive glass, but not necessarily, or even often, unscathed. Unfortunate encounters with glass can lead to the stride-dedicom or interface straits being permanently damaged, causing a total inability to stride or weave respectively. Damage to the computational strait hampers cognition and chalkweaving, damage to the memory strait causes memory loss, damage to the interpreter and potential straits cause an overall weakening of the functioning of the lattice. And particularly widespread damage could merely have bought time, having left the straits in a state where they begin a slow, painful decay into non-function.

With all that being said, reverse unravelling remains the sole reason why denizens of the Switchboard can survive an encounter with glass, and are thus almost blessed in this regard. The cultivation of RUteks has been viewed by many - especially particularly noteworthy Striders - as an essential, as glass can always appear anywhere, and those caught unawares will likely meet an early grave.

## Prop. Glass' Alternative Shape
There is something of a hole that exists in the writ of glass, stemming from its origin and how it conflicts with all else that we know about the Switchboard. The nature of this hole is outlined under the [[Calcodynamics]];

![[Calcodynamics#The Fundamentals]]

The first one is damning enough to the origin of glass, as glass - in the current model of the Switchboard - is *not* chalk. This rule thus has an exception; that all things in the Switchboard are made of chalk - except for the Vitric Shelf, which is made of glass, which is its very own thing. Not wholly unworkable or even particularly dreadful, but still not the maximally elegant worldbuilding I want from Samsara.

Where the larger issue arises is that the Astrolabic quite literally fabricated Glass. If glass is not made of chalk, what then is it? How is the Astrolabe able to do this? Why can - or rather should its - calcic mechanics be able to realize something wholly *un*calcic? Is glass from outside the Switchboard? Does some new caveat need to be added to its mechanics? Exceptions can exist but is this particular one the best or only way to do this?

Behold my proposal; glass is - instead of utterly inexplicable at the fundamental material level - **perfected chalkweave**.

Perhaps that, as a response to the potential annihilation of the Switchboard, the Astrolabe concocted an equation - or process involving an equation - capable of in turn, producing perfect chalkweave, and this perfected weft took on properties - through praximechanics or as an inherent property of its pattern ([[Calcodynamics#Inductive Weave|inductive weave]] might be good reading in this regard) - that we now understand as chalkweave. Weft so perfect that it warps all other weft into perfection as well.

This idea has a number of key appeals.

One is just the sheer aesthetic of a final perfection being a form of destruction. I am simply a sucker for that kind of thing. The metaphor of chalk perfection bringing about something akin to annihilation - the strongest chalkweavers working towards an end they both (possibly) cannot achieve, as well as being what would destroy them - is simply immensely satisfying on a thematic front.

The second is more grounded; in the earlier iterations of glass, glass had the ability to transmute chalk into more glass, in a phenomenon known as **calciphagy**. It was this devouring, transmutation action of glass that made it so particularly deadly, as it could swiftly overrun a lattice in small amounts of time, and - left alone - could gradually takeover much larger amounts of chalk, from small locales and environments, to areas the sizes of neighborhoods, city blocks, whole cities, countries, continents, all the way up to - if not interfered with - an entire planet. This absolutely apocalyptic power in the hands of glass was - as I saw it - absolutely necessary to convey how truly threatening it was.

The third and final - and perhaps appropriately so, as it stretches the limits of what I can mechanically justify - is that glass, ideally, would be uniquely caustic to the lattices and straits of those with the Strider and Weave Protocols. Perhaps by being highly entropic phenomena, or generators of large amounts of entropy within a lattice. Either way, glass would be particularly predatory to Striders and Weavers. Narratively, the main driver of implementing this is to have an in-canon power equalizer between those who can Stride and Weave - the Sil'khan, Fel-Arcad and Vahnkin to a lesser extent - and those who can do neither - the Lancasters. This crack in the otherwise nigh-flawless armor of the gifted in the Switchboard is immensely usable for building narrative.

Glass' ability to shred and reform lattices, somehow paired with glass' ability to transmute and propagate, and furthermore coupled with the power to uniquely afflict those outfitted to be the strongest by pure mechanics - perfecting, spreading perfection and deposing the mighty - was my idealized vision for glass and the perfect shape for it to be realized in narrative. When contemplating concepts such as the [[SB_Biota#The Shattered|Shattered]], it becomes somewhat more clear to what extents it can be taken.

Glass being chalkweave would also make it subject to calcic principles, making it slightly more explicable how it interacts with the wider Switchboard the way it does. An instantly relevant example of this is the [[Chalk Ritualism#Vitric Ritualism|Vitric Ritualism]], that makes use of glass in chalk ritualism to more deliberately harness and thus direct its negentropic effects. It would also mean that under certain conditions, glass could be fought by **unravelling** it, though this would necessarily be a difficult thing to do to preserve the sheer lethality inherent to the concept.

The transmutation/propagation idea inherent to this idea of glass does create some problems in how it is used later, but I imagine most of these problems can be solved via application of the world's existing mechanics, particularly the already-mentioned Vitric Ritualism, as the various ritualism forms present and practiced in the Switchboard are, at their core, means of working around more troublesome mechanics in place.

> As a final note to this, there is a place for proposing that the workings of glass - particularly its quality of propagating more of itself as it simplifies complex lattices - is **praximechanical** in nature; the ability for glass to spawn more of itself stemming from the praxis-level warfare waged against the concept and thus doctrine of **complexity itself**. In a sense, complexity exists as a metric on astrolabic ledgers, and this metric can be depleted for glass to spawn as it perfects complex weave.

## Unstoppable Perfecting
The clauses that affect how quickly some unlucky weave are unwound down to its perfected state are mainly;

- The amount of incident glass.
- The surface are of the incident glass.
- The nature of the victim lattice, such as if it belongs to thinking weave, or possesses one of the hereditary protocols. 

You could thus make the case that glass is uniquely inclined towards perfecting the lattices of more **complex things**. In older iterations of glass, this simply was a thing that *was*, with little by way of concrete writ on why it was this way. Even now, it functionally is just something that *is*, in that it 'just works' and accomplishes all of the narrative ambitions that glass is meant to. However, what was proposed by way of an explanation was a sort of '**vitric momentum**'.

The logic of it is that as glass perfects its way through a lattice, scything through weave and stitching it back in accordance with its nature behind it, it builds a sort of 'momentum'. In some of the **negentropic applications** of glass, some measures of glass are used in appliances to perform the task of converting **heat to motion** - something elaborated upon later - and care must be taken to ensure that this glass does go out of control and start ripping through everything around it. This is called **overshooting**, where glass escapes the bounds of what it was meant to act upon, and goes viral and rampant. Glass that escapes containment is *immensely* difficult to stop and contain for this reason.

The more glass chews through, the more momentum it builds, and the more it builds, the more it can chew through, this loop repeating itself until it inevitably exceeds containment parameters and overshoots. In an appliance, you might just lose a toaster oven, but glass that's incident on a lattice will peel through the top layer and obtain the power needed to shred through even deeper - propagating as it does - and soon overwhelming the lattice.

As such, more complex weave - when ripped through - builds glass' momentum more than simpler weave, and thus once glass has torn through the top layers of a Kin's skin, it will have minimal difficulty slicing through the rest of them, until it finally reaches and annihilates the straits. 

## 'Dilute' Glass: Scintillate
> Later sections of this document tackle the origin of this material phenomena in further detail.

**Scintillate** describes a stable crystalline chalk-glass complex that exists as a result of the Astrolabic resolutions upon planetary equations following the rise of the Seventh Skydancer, Skydancer Ryjik, the Eater. Creating a stable crystal alloy of chalk and glass artificially is difficult and dangerous and thus it is rather convenient for the Third Kin that scintillate's chief source is from the somewhat rare [[Biomes of the Dancirah#Esoteric Biomes|crystalline biomes]] that spawn on the many spheres in the Great Sky. There, it can be mined like virtually any other solid material, graded based on the mass ratio between chalk and glass, and put to various uses.

Its three primary uses are in **weaponry**, **medicine** and **technology**;

- As a **weapon**, while glass weaponry is decidedly lethal, scintillate weaponry are less so, still imparting their negentropic effects but to a lesser extent. As such they see extensive use as a means of **suppression** rather than outright extermination, and a well-placed scintillate-tipped round can suppress a target's ability to weave and even stride momentarily. 

- As a **medicine**, it sees both genuine and recreational uses, elaborated upon further in this document, under 'Taking the Glass'.

- In **technology**, scintillate is a much safer way of harnessing glass' unique negentropic effects, particularly the behavior it exhibits in turning heat back into motion in the Switchboard, which serves as the basis for the functioning of a wide variety of appliances and machinery in a world that has been deprived of the phenomenon of electricity. 

A final major benefit of the usage of scintillate is that the presence of chalk in its structure makes it far more responsive to various forms of calcic manipulation, such as through the chalk ritualism.

## Glass-Stricken Life
When glass is given free rein in a lattice, what results is an entity known as a **Shattered**, a being refined into a perverted perfection of what it once was;

![[SB_Biota#The Shattered]]

## Vitreodynamics
Despite their limited understanding and extensive fear of it, the denizens of the Switchboard have found more than a number of ways to harness glass and its negentropy for their own applications. Ranging from household appliances to breaching computer systems to a medical aid to building impenetrable, inescapable prisons, the endless audacity - and the resourcefulness it fuels - of the denizens of the Switchboard drives them to make use of even the most poignant anathema to their existence.

### The DevitNet and Computation
> glass has played a major part in the nuances of communication and computation within the Switchboard, occasionally note even in the form of violent antagonism. The full scale of it being as extensive as it us thus mandates that one reads the full writ themselves, found in [[Communications and Compute]].

That being said, one of the most prolific uses of glass is in the **glasswire**, and integral step in the process undergone by some Third Kin who aimed to eliminate the distance between minds and the communication gap inherent to that, and thus create a **zero-distance cognitive space**, where 'perfect communication' could be realized in the aim of fulfilling doctrine;

![[Communications and Compute#^433408]]

### The Panopticon
A truly bizarre creation, the Panopticon was formerly a Vault in the Switchboard situated near a gaping jaw to the Vitric Shelf. The vault was krashed and Striders began a litany of experiments with it, due to the nature of one of its defenses; a seemingly infinite labyrinth of cell-like rooms that to many, would prove inescapable. As their experimentation generated massive quantities of information and created a considerable amount of calcic activity, the nearby jaw grew towards it, and aimed to swallow the vault whole. However, it proved unable to do so, resulting in the jaw jammed shut with the structure, but the vault itself now straddling the divide between the Sky and the Vitric Shelf. ^6c845b

Narratively, the Spyndl Academy in conjunction with various other factions seized control over it and now use it as a prison. Through the power of a reprogrammed Vault Mind, they are able to move components - walls, floors, ceilings, entire rooms, collections of them - around individually, allowing them to encase imprisoned convicts in cocoons of Glass. Escape is - theoretically - impossible, as just about any conceivable calcic method employable is subject to the effects of Glass.

> And in addition to this structurally, mechanically, flawless prison is a warden to watch over it, maintaining an endless vigil. Being a reprogrammed Vault Mind, the warden Panoptes is bestowed a prime directive of oversight, and is thus able to watch over the entirety of the Panopticon's structure and inhabitants.

Considering its sheer scale, complexity and use, the Panopticon is classified as a [[SB_Astromechanics#Non-Planetary Structures|non-planetary super-structure]].

### Vitric Warfare
> [[Weave and Warfare]] is recommended reading for this section.

An altercation between a wielder of the Strider and Weave Protocols, and a Grounded (one who lacks such power) would be terribly one-sided. As detailed, the Weave Protocol allows for the manipulation of quite literally the stuff of local reality, and Weave and Warfare outlines extensively just how weaponizable local reality is. Lacking the necessary modification to the interface strait to output chalk, the Grounded thus cannot weave chalk, use higher-level teks, perform rituals or perform the Flash Protocol. While they can use a relic that operates off of its own internal calcic supply, they will only be able to perform the absolute baseline of the functions it has, while being subject to a non-trivial salvo of restrictions and impediments. Even ignoring the school of white, lacking any conviction in the things of the Void means they cannot manipulate curvature, depthstride, requisition boons from the Void, weave spatial barriers or expand hollows.

Performing a fairly cursory examination, one would readily conclude that the Grounded have no true means of opposing those who can utilize either the powers of white or black. The discrepancy in power is simply far too great as to be utterly unbridgeable. However, the Grounded - by not having the Striders' and Weavers' strengths - do not have their weaknesses, most foremost of this being a greatly reduced vulnerability to the perfecting influence of Glass.

Striders and Weavers - who possess an immense vulnerability to both - are thus at immense risk of coming up against a weapon that harnesses glass in some way. Even just a lucky strike from a crude dagger is more than enough to dispatch an otherwise phenomenally powerful denizen of the Switchboard. The Grounded - who can even take cuts from glass and survive long enough for their own innate reverse unravelling, even though slower relative to the other families - thus extensively make use of glass in various weapons and weapon systems, as a means to equalize them and wielders of higher powers. The power presented by glass makes it both a powerful offensive and defensive tool, as it abhors and shreds chalkweave with little effort, this meaning it shreds even the techniques used by calcic fighter as they deploy them.

For this reason alone, even those unable to use the more supernatural of powers used by the Third Kin are able to fight on equal footing with them. Coupled with all manners of other enhancements such as [[Teks#Generations of Tek Equations|G1 teks]], [[Birthing and Being#Chrome|Chromegrafts]] and more, the **Esomechanist** superclass under Weave and Warfare is born, an esoteric superclass that breaks the mold of all other superclasses, and specializes in drawing powers from elsewhere other than the schools of white and black. While it is very uncommon for an Esomechanist - even empowered with glass weaponry - to measure up to even the shadow of a decent wielder of either white or black, underestimating them is done at one's own peril, and the arrogance and pride born from superiority of powers has led many to cheap, unfortunate deaths.

The Lancasters in particular are very fond of glass weaponry, and even as they are mostly looked down upon - even actively despised - by members of the other Families, very few Lancasters are ever caught without some glass on their person, and a strike from a perceived inferior is often the least expected of all kinds.

### pNarrat: The Teeth of Ryjik
The Teeth of Skydancer Ryjik describe a class of rare, storied, glass-based weaponry that arose with the Eater Skydancer. 

![[Chalk Ritualism#History]]

But the most storied bit of knowledge acquired from the inquiry of Ryjik was in the making of weaponry. Before the attack on the Trinary Complex in the Vitric Shelf, Skydancers Onuris, The Hammer, and Ryjik, the Eater, collaborated in shaping a weapon. A weapon that harnessed chalk, glass, their stable crystalline-complex and the scintillate glass-inversion. It was called the **PRISMpick**, and it had power that spanned the DevitNet and the Dancirah. With it, with a single strike, it could breach and seize control of any network, any computational device, carve a path into any Vault, sunder any weave, and contend even with - admittedly - lesser ritualism. Within it was the power of Skydancer Ryjik; the power to eat, and render impotent. ^77b630

The PRISMpick was the first of the weapons that would come to be known as the **Teeth of Ryjik**. With their power and nature known and yet not fully explored, they became incredibly coveted. Forging them is no easy task, as glass is a material that actively opposes being worked upon. As such, so few of them exist that they have attained the status of myth, the PRISMpick itself being lost during the Refrain. This has only cultivated more interest in forging more of them, by any means possible, as those who wield them are believed to be able to defeat any obstacle to their aims, be it chalkweaver or  construct. ^a07878

For now, the only ones suspected to truly have or be able to forge Teeth weaponry are Skydancer Ryjik's apostolics within the Sil'khan Sabai; nomad-zealots that worship the the Skydancer's and live to spread their words. Ryjik's faithful in particular - the **Eaters of Ryjik** - laud themselves as crusaders against the Vaults in the Switchboard, reenacting the purpose for which Ryjik arose to begin with.  

### Legacy: Instrument Six
> A holdover from an iteration of glass that precedes even the Project Samsara. It will likely face revision or outright deprecation.

A holdover from earlier iterations of glass, the Instrument Six is a specially-designed anti-Strider weapon employed to deal with the Mystics during the height of the Mysticism crisis. Due to the Mystics' immense power, conventional engagement methods proved ineffective, and so new approaches needed to be taken.

Taking the form of hypodermic syringe or bullet, a measure of prepared glass encased in a calcic 'artifact' that directs the payload, the glass can be delivered in a manner that - in an overwhelming number of cases - attacks solely the Strider Protocol while leaving the Strider unharmed otherwise. It proved very effective, and was one of the many prongs on the fork that finally took down the Mystics.

Variants of it were created;
1. **I-6As**, which only temporarily suppresses the ability to Stride. It is widely used and regarded as an underhanded method to gain an upper-hand in a fight.
2. **I-6Ds** or '**sixties**', the actual military grade iteration of it, locking down the ability to Stride to facilitate suppression and capture. However, it's effects can be undone using various methods. For every ritual there are counter rituals.
3. **I-6Rs**; '**rulebreakers**', an iteration designed to attack the Strider Protocol of victims as well as the Mysticism itself. It ultimately led to the downfall of the Mystics.
4. **I-6Es**; '**executioners**', issued by justice systems as a punitive measure, and cannot be undone. It irreversibly destroys the Strider Protocol, and makes those inflicted with it, 'Slow'.

The existence of I-6 drives endless conflict across the Switchboard, as they are the simplest way to defeat a Strider. Despite them being outlawed and open production ceasing after the Mysticism crisis, underground manufacturers and black markets continue their production and distribution. Striders themselves occasionally carry some of it themselves, as a last resort.

### pNarrat: 'Taking the Glass'
It is hardly beyond conception that the Switchboard and the people in it - beautiful as it and they may be - might cause strife to those within in. Pain and suffering have always been inescapable parts of being - perhaps even inherent to the very reality of it - and there are as many means of dealing with this as there are people dealing with it. Some are perhaps uniquely outfitted with the manner and methods to deal with it in ways that wouldn't be described as 'destructive', but those are the lucky ones. For some, a wholesale ablation of this affliction is far more preferable.

Chalk remembers, glass forgets; and with pinpoint, surgical application of glass to the memory strait, it is possible to utterly destroy parts of it. Traumatic events can simply be erased from one's cognitive records, and the vacuum replaced with other things or left to simply exist as is; a hole that's inexplicable, rather than debilitating.

It has come to be used extensively by many who've been subjected to the rawer edges of the Switchboard, such as those who fought on the numerous battlefronts that mark the verse's history and built the world that exists today. The Spyndl Academy and its Operators in particular are known for extensive practice and usage of this '**glass therapy**', as a method of coping with the hard realities they regularly face.

> A narrative example of this was during the events of Chrome's Graveyard, were a very many number of Striders, particularly Sil'khan, suffered immense harm at the hands of psychological weapons employed by the antagonist of the time. Extensive usage of glass therapy was necessary to heal the damage, but it inevitably resulted in many who were unable to articulate what happened to them beyond it being terrible, and much more harm as glass therapy is not without its risks.

Inevitably, it saw usage as both a recreational drug, and a weapon. 

As a weapon, it saw extensive use in purging the memory of its victims, either to target certain certain bits of it, or 'wiping the slate clean', as it were. Extremely precise usage of glass therapy that makes use of diluted glass and the Vitric ritualism have even been used to write false memories to the vacuum, to utterly deceive a victim and make them believe whatever a bad actor may choose. 

As a drug, in diluted form it can be used to lightly deaden the efficacy edges of the Five Straits, giving a fuzz to memories and an airiness to thinking and processing - all of which are temporary due to the subject's own passive reverse unravelling repairing the damage. While under the effect however, this effect on the psyche induces states of 'euphoric apathy' in subjects, where the inability to fully recall and grasp what is being recalled leads to the conclusion that they do not matter, and the things that a subject is inclined to - their happier times - are brought to the fore, the fuzziness of these warmer memories making them appear warmer still. Stronger doses can induce temporary vacuums in immediate memory, and chalkweave can fill these vacuums with 'false' memories, giving vivid hallucinations - artfully crafted by practitioners of this very thing - or the opportunity to live through experiences lived by others. This drug - **scintillate** - is one of the more valued oddities of the verse, though it exists in endless contention by many parties in the Switchboard.

### Entropy Reversal
> Thanks doctor.

> [[Calcodynamics]] is recommended reading for this section.

To summarize what is likely a very complex application of various verse mechanics, glass has the ability to **convert heat in the Switchboard into motion**, via its negentropic properties and thus the ability to reverse entropy. The usefulness of this quirk of its nature is applied most extensively in [[SB_Technology]]. If one is so inclined, they can take this fact and run with it, and be no worse for wear.

But of course, there are mechanics behind it.

Killing the atom in the building of the Samsara canon led to many, many headaches down the line. While I am always one for a challenge, worldbuilding has given me a taste for 'elegance of execution', insomuch as things not just work, but do so in a manner that can be - to the best of my own ability - grasped fairly easily. Light was one such issue that we had no elegant solution for for the longest time, almost resulting to the integration of 'atom-less quantum mechanics' just to facilitate light working. Thankfully we did eventually find a means to work around this that met my criteria for elegance in execution.

Heat and motion in the Switchboard are another such thing. To solve the problem of heat, I formulated [[Calcodynamics#Inductive Weave|inductive weave]], which was chalkweave that under conditions, could **incite itself** on other chalkweave, basically allowing weft to move almost through vacuum from endpoint to endpoint. Its relationship to heat was that objects in motion in the Switchboard, when they slowed down, released 'heat weave'. Why is this case? What does this? I propositioned the doctor for the answer and what I was given was fairly simple; nothing. Nothing does. It is simply a thing that is. It - like many other things - is merely a first principle of the verse; a bit of rule writ upon which all other things hinge while it itself hinges on nothing. We can define the nuances of this behavior and the conditionals that modify it, but it does not change the fact that it merely one of the many things in the verse that simply *are*. There is no 'why'."

In much the same way, glass is another of those things. Irrespective of the operating principle that best serves to realize glass - be it perfected chalkweave or free from chalk entirely - it simply does what it does, and while we can define all sorts of metrics around the doing, there is no *why*-ing the *doing* itself. It's like asking why, in our own universe, things tend towards equilibrium states. From osmosis in tiny cells to the nuclear atom-forges of stars, things just seem to like to be balanced. And in the Switchboard, things want to be complex. But glass opposes this, and while often this fact is incredibly problematic, in some instances it can be harnessed by the careful and the cunning.

### pNarrat: 'Nullscopes'
> You've opened a can of worms with this one, doctor.

There is an intersection of the various intricacies of the praximechanics and similar subject matter outlined under [[The Blank-Slate Mind]], and the nature of glass as a negentropic phenomenon. It stems from the fact that at the core of doctrines, convictions and the praximechanics that stems from their being taken to narratively-useful ends, is the concept of Bayesianity - or rather, forming accurate beliefs via reason and observation.

It is that final bit - observation - where glass is introduced in a rather interesting way. When you observe something in the Switchboard, it goes on record that you did - in your [[The Astrolabe#Ledgers|ontological ledger]] that the Astrolabe maintains to properly factor in you as a variable for its calculus. The denizens of the Switchboard - no one really - can see these ledgers however, as they dwell within [[The Doctrine of Passing#The Current|the Current]], outside of their ability to perceive. As such, while I can observe you, I cannot observe your totality, because that is hidden from me by virtue of the mechanics of the verse. To obtain more from you - the contents of your ledger - I am compelled to interact with you, or something that has interacted with you; but I am *compelled* to *interact* with *something*.

Imagine then, that I wasn't.

What if there was some esoteric means to obtain truth from literally, nothing? What if I could wrench accurate answers to any questions by querying a perfect vacuum and seeing it spit out matter? You could say the powers of Black and the Void facilitate something like this - trawling the depths of the Dancirah's grave for fallen boons - but that is still very, *very* far removed from *absolute nothing*. Glass' negentropy facilitates something that splits open the very workings of the verse; the ability to obtain information from a ledger without interacting in any way, shape or form with the object of that ledger. I could merely wave a hand with glass in it and obtain the entirety, the totality, of all there is to know of anything of my choosing.

Under the mechanics of knowledge of desired information translating to tangible calcic power, something like this immediately breaks the system. Via glass, one could obtain any desired secret they'd like, and receive immense calcic dividends by writ of praxis, powering them up beyond belief, and all who shared their doctrine by extension. Glass would simply facilitate obtaining answers, as it would allow for forming accurate beliefs about things without needing to undergo the rigor of interacting with them.

But how would it be done?

This is the bits of it all where it gets somewhat muddy, as 'how it would be done' is a question that ideally must factor in narrative ambitions and implications. At the crux of this idea however, is the ability to read ledgers and obtain information from those ledgers without ever having had to interact with the object of those ledgers.

- The doctor proposed that merely jamming glass into one's own straits - the computational strait in particular, as it functions as a 'bayesian engine' of sorts - would allow for a total restructuring of its structure and thus functionality, which would facilitate this querying-the-vacuum negentropic power - an explanation that's weighty on the start and end but scanty in the middle.

- My idea is making use of the [[Chalk Ritualism#Vitric Ritualism|vitric ritualism]], which benefits from being an already-established extension of an already-established and thoroughly designed mechanic. It also answers the question of 'how' you'd know what ledger you aimed to obtain from the vacuum, using some rudimentary form of targeting via the various other components used in the ritual.

- My final idea is something a little further on from those; a device that allows for screening the ledgers in the Current, allowing obtaining information from vacuum. This I - after much deliberation, I assure you - have dubbed the '**nullscope**'. Much like a telescope spots distance land through a vacant expanse, so does the nullscope spot radiant truths from the oppressive vacuum.

The implications of negentropy/entropy reversal used in this way are outrightly verse-breaking, and as such, while it is very easy to add all manners of constraints and conditionals upon the harnessing of such a mechanic, it is even easier to simply declare that it does not exist, or is not used in the canon the way it could be, saving the denizens of the Switchboard from perhaps the sharpest flavor of annihilation ever conceived. 

## pNarrat: Controlled Substance
Glass is in many ways the plutonium of the Samsara canon, though more dangerous in some ways and less in others. What remains a similarity between them however, is that many parties have a vested interest in minimizing how much of it exists in circulation within a civilizational context. We don't want bad actors developing dirty bombs, just as denizens of the Switchboard don't want widespread practice of Vitric ritualism, or glass blades and bullets in every coat pocket. For this reason, glass is a **controlled substance**, and perhaps the most controlled *anything* in the Samsara canon.

Consider the source; all glass emerges from the Vitric Shelf, and does so via effusion from the Jaws that dot the Great Sky. In the time of the First Praxis War, the Eradication Imperative were able to cut space and the boundaries between the Dancirah and the Shelf, opening Jaws wherever they pleased, annihilating the Vermeil civilization and leaving entire planets suffering from the scintillating scars that result from the usage of this weaponry. Following that war, they employed similar tactics against the Third Kin the Second Praxis War, though to somewhat limited effect as the Third Kin were far more capable combatants in just about every regard. Following their defeat and the later storming of the Trinary Complex, the means and methods of forming the jaws artificially was lost, and thus, all jaws that still exist are naturally occurring and fleeting, opening and closing from time to time, sometimes disappearing from one place to appear elsewhere.

Their subsequent rarity and impermanence has thus made them fairly easy to monitor, seize control of, and thus restrict access to. In the spirit of mutually-shared good, the fact that glass is so overwhelmingly dangerous to the overwhelming majority of people has thus incentivized cooperation towards restricting the proliferation of glass throughout the Great Sky, accomplished through various bodies all operating under the umbrella of a **Vitric Control Coalition**.

The functions of the VCC are as such; 

- **Tracking, Securing and Containment**: The number one priority of the VCC - their prime directive - is the tracking and securing of Vitric jaws, and the containment of the glass they release. Be it tiny slivers glue to a blunt club, or an entire planet from the earlier eras, nothing is more paramount than ensuring that all glass that exists is accounted for.

- **Extractive and Economic**: The VCC are the sole authority in the Switchboard allowed to 'mine' glass from the Vitric Shelf, accomplished through the construction of elaborate free-standing space platforms around a suitable jaw, and chipping away at its 'teeth'; the stalagmite-like projections of pure glass that round the rim of the spatial distortion. Mined glass is then processed, packaged and sold to those with VCC-validated need and uses for it.

- **Administrative and Managerial**: The VCC is responsible for maintaining a comprehensive database of all glass in circulation in the entire Switchboard, as well as ensuring it is being used only in the functions where it was released for use. The many genuine, tangible, good uses of glass has thus made it such that glass can be requested and allotted to those who request it for meeting these purposes, but VCC administrators and managers are responsible for ensuring this is the sole manner in which glass is used.

- **Innovative**: Profits generated from their activity are used to further study into glass - both into how it can be used and how its more negative effects can be mitigated. They've come to canonically own something akin to patents upon most means of using Glass.

- **Medical**: Their research into the workings of glass, especially its effects upon the lattice of the Third Kin, has uniquely situated them for addressing all manners of physiological damage done by Glass. The VCC's own medical complexes are often a last resort for those who've been afflicted by glass' effects.

- **Informative**: glass is by all metrics a truly fearsome force of nature, and the fear it elicits, when mixed with ignorance, can yield paranoia and poor practices. The VCC fights ignorance and misinformation about glass to ensure those who use it or accidentally come in contact with it know how to handle any situation that might arise.

- **Retrieval and Disposal**: Occasionally, an instance of **Vitric Breach** occurs, caused by mishandled glass being given the opportunity to rip through reality, propagating massively and soon escaping control. The VCC are responsible for responding to these situations, containing them, retrieving the glass, rescuing anyone or thing left behind, and indexing as well as disposing of the mass of glass material.

- **Investigative**: When glass goes unaccounted for, the VCC are tasked with tracking it down. Tracing how measures of it changes hand, investigating the buyers, sellers and mules of the material, finding out the motive of the final holder, and arresting all those involved are all within their scope and authority, all to ensure glass doesn't make it into the wrong hands.

- **Interventive**: Occasionally, glass falls into the wrong hands, and those hands aren't willing to relinquish that glass without a fight. The VCC thus has paramilitary divisions assembled from multiple contributors to pursue armed interventions where and when necessary. Spyndl's Operators are often seen in the VCC's ranks.

It is in the best interest of nearly everyone that an organization such as the VCC is given proper rein and resources to function, and a transparency of operation is essential for the task of ensuring glass is securely contained. However, there are always corrupt elements about, and there are those who are far more interested in the unique brand of power that wielding glass confers. 

## pNarrat: A Leak in the Current
> [[The Astrolabe]] and [[The Doctrine of Passing]] are essential preliminary reading for this section.

Despite this very much not being what glass does, it is still interpreted functionally as such; glass destroys chalkweave. This is a concern in ways stressed upon time and time again in the runtime of this document, but perhaps the final - and the greatest - problem presented by glass is what effect it has on all things Astrolabic. In particular, the concern is born from the fact that glass - or rather, that Jaws that open between the Dancirah and Shelf - seem uniquely capable of interacting with the Calcic Current, and thus, with ledgerial subject matter.

This is, as one would immediately imagine, indescribably disastrous, as it would mean that glass is capable of directly interfacing with not just things, but the *records* of things, and it is via these records that the Astrolabe performs its calculus. There is a leak in the system now, where the ontological ledgers of the verse are subject to destruction at the hands of a mechanic in that verse. 

Ideally, the Current would be a closed, but gradually lengthening loop. glass both shortens this loop, and breaks its continuity entirely. The most immediate concern is what this means for the mechanics behind the death of Third Kin. When a denizen of the Switchboard is in the between-state of un-life and birth, forming - as it were - via either gestation or the Ritual of Conjugation ([[SB_Physiology]] and [[Birthing and Being]] are recommended reading on this point), they draw from the Current to pull some of the integral material that forms their backbone. Upon death, all the weft that makes up a Third Kin is returned to the Current in a similar manner. Functionally normally, boons are gifted, wielded, and then relinquished to be gifted to the next generation, spread across peoples and the entire Switchboard. 

But glass breaks this system. It is unknown how or where it is the jaws act, but there is reason to believe they do, and the result of this is that the boons that travel in the Current - memories and powers and so much more - are tangibly, outrightly destroyed at the hands of glass, regularized down to simply perfect - but horribly useless - weft. Iterated over time, many theorize that each generation of the Switchboard will be weaker than the last; knowing less, being capable of less, daring to do less, a reduction of the complexities of their existence down to a useless, monotone slurry.

An end of the world scenario.

For now, while there is some proof it is occurring, there is little means to measure the extent of this decay, and even less means to prevent it. The jaws operate upon their own logics, and the Vitric Shelf appears to be a permanent fixture of the Switchboard's ontology. As such, while it remains a problem, perhaps even a deeply worrying one, the sheer lack of quantifiability of danger and qualification of mitigatory methods have convinced many to adopt a sort of apathy to it, the apathy many in the Switchboard have towards the Second Refrain.

Seeing as it is such a poignant subject matter to discuss, it has been given a name to better convey its nature to others; **Vitric Consolidation**.
