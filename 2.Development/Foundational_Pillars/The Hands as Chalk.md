# The Hands as Chalk
The entirety of the Switchboard runs on the dynamics and interplay of information in tangible form, known as 'Chalk'. The Hands as Chalk foundational pillar seeks to describe Chalk and how denizens of the Switchboard interact with it, how it interacts with the wider Switchboard, and the products of the interplay with all three.

## Tangible Information - Chalk
As described under Information Tangibility, information constitutes a tangible component of all things in the Switchboard. *All* things in the Switchboard *are* information; they and their properties are information as well. As such, all things in the Switchboard exist as configurations - patterns - of unordered information. We call this 'Chalk'.

Chalk is information in physical form, taking on the appearance of jagged, translucent yet mildly cloudy crystals, diffracting pure light into rainbow spectra when passing through it. Reduced to powdered form, it appears similar to cloudy, powdered glass. When in use, Chalk typically takes the form of 'ribbons'; gossamer streaks of chalk, moving seemingly weightlessly, suspended by invisible strings. Chalk also comes in 'ray' or 'radiance' form, emitted by [[SB_Astromechanics#The Grand Stellar Procession|armillary stars]], in the Switchboard Sky. When these rays are slowed or strike an obstacle, they deposit as chalk in dust/powder form.

Chalk as it exists normally is random information. When arranged or 'patterned', it takes the shape of more conventional objects, such as things as people, as well as properties such as color, taste, etc. From the infinite randomness, all things can be sequenced and created, the mechanics of doing so described further on.

### Pattern and 'Ribbon' Duality
Because all things in the Switchboard are made of patterned chalk, it helps to view objects (such as a piece of fruit) as an origami of chalk 'paper'. When folded, it takes the form the name compels us to reasonably expect. However, when unfolded, a formerly three-dimensional object now becomes flat - chalk ribbons. These chalk ribbons still contain the information of the former three-dimensional object, needing only instructions on 'folding' to be supplied to restore them to their original form. This is the Pattern-Ribbon Duality.

A shirt can be reduced to a chalk ribbon containing all the information of that shirt. Same thing for a house plant, or a slice of bread, or a jet engine or skyscraper. Simple things like a pencil, complex constructs such as a silicon board - **all can be reduced to their ribbon form, and interacted with in their ribbon form, which is the state at which most chalk interactions take place - down at the ribbon level**. This allows us to neatly move into how chalk is interacted with. ^c91b12

## The Weave Protocol
Chalk achieves a state of 'stability' in crystalline form, dense amounts of it forming deposits in the Wellsprings. In dust form, chalk traverses the great Sky of the Switchboard, moving between armillary stars and Wellsprings, planets, vaults, and regions of curvature and low depth, falling into the Void. Most meaningful interaction between chalk, however, happens in ribbon form, and interaction with ribbon chalk by beings in the Switchboard is made possible through the **Weave Protocol**, a hereditary, innate modification to the **Five Straits**.

#### The Five Straits
![[SB_Physiology#The Five Straits]]

The modification made by the Weave Protocol is to the **interface strait**; while those without the Weave Protocol possess only external **intake straits** and *internal* interface straits that facilitate communication with the lattice between the straits, those with the Weave Protocol - or **Weavers** - posses interface straits externally as well. This allows for outputting folded chalk created by the computational strait, turning a formerly one-way street into a two-way one. It is this singular modification that facilitates **all** of chalkweaving. 

### Information Affinity
Thinking weave in the Switchboard are possessed of an affinity for information, by virtue of possessing the potential strait. As thinking weave lives and dwells in the Switchboard, it takes in chalk, consuming it for its functions creating a calcic vacuum that must be replenished by taking in more chalk from the outside environment, this being latent chalk. Beyond elementary functions for simply living, taking in chalk is necessary to provide the fuel for various acts of **chalkweaving**, particularly with regards to techniques and abilities.

Like taking in air to the lungs via breathing, denizens of the Switchboard bearing the Weave Protocol passively take in chalk and store it in the potential strait, where it awaits harnessing by the other straits for various functions. As calcic abilities are used, or under other circumstances, chalk is depleted from the potential strait, and must be replenished.

The rate by which chalk is thus accumulated varies based on a number of factors;

- The '**efficiency**' of the **interface and interpreter straits** (also elaborated upon later). Chalk enters the lattice through the interface strait, and thus is subject to the throughput allowed by it. Additionally, chalk taken in must be analyzed by the interpreter strait to separate pattern and weave from plain chalk, a task that also takes time. The product of both of these is a subject's **chalk throughput**, and they are in turn subject to the subject's general, overall calcic proficiency, a product of the logic surrounding their [[The Blank-Slate Mind#Doctrines|doctrines]] coupled with a litany of hereditary factors.

- The **availability** of latent chalk in the vicinity. When more chalk is present, passive accumulation is performed more quickly. In locales like wellsprings and certain biomes on planets, chalk is plentiful and allows for bountiful passive accumulation. In other environments like the inside of vaults or the Challenger Dark, the available chalk is severely reduced, the rate of accumulation responding similarly.

- Whether **active draw** is being employed. Those with the **Weave Protocol** have the ability to actively pull chalk from the environment - much like taking a deep breath - vastly increasing the rate of chalk pulled into the potential straits. When preparing to use a calcic ability, one may choose to suffuse themselves with chalk to balance out the chalk expended when the ability is used, or they may uptake chalk after using a power to rapidly replenish their reserves. This is used usually when perform various calcic actions in quick succession, such as in combat.

- The presence of **interferences**, which are factors that can either **hamper** or **catalyze** chalk uptake. An active ritual, a held Tek or relic, someone *else's* Tek or relic, and environmental effect, natural or artificial, may alter the rate of uptake of chalk.

Accumulating chalk can, however, saturate the lattice beyond its ability to store. This is dangerous, as unharnessed chalk is functionally random information, and this random information can 'spill over' into other straits - particularly the memory strait - and overwrite the useful information there with noise, an occurrence conveniently called **overwrite**. 

> Dealing with an abundance of chalk is often done by 'flaring', though it is noteworthy that those with the Strider Protocol are far more capable of flaring than those who can solely weave. Flaring is converting excess chalk to something easily dissipated, such as heat, by subjecting it to highly-efficient equations in the computational strait. Weavers who want to get rid of excess chalk usually expend it by weaving something of high calcic density but considerable instability, allowing it to resolve by collapsing and dissipating chalk into the environment. More skilled Weavers can cause calcic crystal to form in their immediate vicinity, trapping the chalk in physical form.

### Weave Mechanics
Interacting with chalk occasionally demands Weavers to utilize the power to Weave in more intricate ways. These are the 'Weave Mechanics'.

> This is of particular interest to [[Chalk Ritualism|Ritualists]], who necessarily must interact with chalk at the macroscopic level to cast rituals.

The most common Weave Mechanic learned by Weavers is **Point Propagation**. Typically, chalk straits are drawn by physical movement of fingers or a hand across a surface, which necessarily requires that the spaces being interacted with are reachable by hands. With Point Propagation, A Weaver can place a finger, multiple fingers or a full hand on a surface, and send out streams of chalk in any direction they choose, allowing reaching locations hands cannot; inside minuscule environments such as machine circuitry, at immense heights, or in conceptual spaces such as minds.

**Ritual Geometry** is a concept that dictates the way certain equations require a subject of that equation to be 'bound' in chalk straits for that equation to function. For example, to start a fire using the Five Straits, you may have to draw a singular, two dimensional circle around the source of fuel. To lockpick a safe using chalk, however, you may have to draw lines all over the the safe that intersect, 'wrapping' it. The Ritual Geometry used is reliant on the parameters of the equation. Encasements of chalk lines are called 'Chalk Boundaries' ^a4757c

Necessarily, some equations may mandate chalk wrapping around the subject, but also that those lines dynamically shift as the equation works upon the subject. In the case of the safe for example, the lines may need to shift into new configurations as the dial is turned one way or the other. Propagating new lines and withdrawing old ones may not allow the equation to work as intended.

The solution to this is **Chalk Within Chalk**. When Five-Strait chalk lines are propagated parallel to each other, additional chalk lines are deployed, perpendicular to the initial. It helps to imagine it as scale of sheet music. These perpendicular 'brace' chalk lines 'hold' the parallel Five-Strait lines, and interface with the Computational Lines. When necessary, the 'brace' lines receive instruction from the Computational Line to move the entire construct of chalk straits, done as the equation demands. 

Control of the CWC brace lines is **Linear Dynamism**, the action of feeding the CWC brace lines with instructions on when a Weaver needs the strait lines to assemble, disassemble and reassemble in intricate shapes, move in certain paths and patterns, all to facilitate fulfillment of the equations being used, or the will of the Weaver. This is particularly relevant when we get to actual Rituals used by Weavers. Linear Dynamism also allows CWC lines to detach the straits from surfaces themselves, granting the Weaver the power to draw and form chalk boundaries in air.

## Latent Chalk
Both the Strider Protocol and the Weave Protocol function by expending chalk to perform actions, chalk that is accumulated actively or passively via information affinity. Chalk exists in 'clouds' of it in dust form in the general environment, and though the concentration can be low, it is present. This is 'Latent Chalk'. Weavers draw from it extensively when using their powers.

> This section delves into world mechanics heavily reliant on concepts outlined in [[SB_Astromechanics]].

Latent Chalk tends to accumulate in already fairly information-dense regions, drawn towards them like water moving from a high point to a lower one. Latent Chalk often accumulates into crystalline form, become crystal chalk, depositing itself and often growing to colossal proportions. We see this often in the [[SB_Astromechanics#The Wellsprings|Wellsprings]], regions of immense information density fed directly by armillary stars. 

### Spontaneous Equations
> Relevant reading for this section include [[Calcodynamics#Hyperweave|Hyperweave]] and [[The Astrolabe#Proposal Hyperweave 'Cooling'|Hyperweave Cooling]].

The armillary stars of the Switchboard, churning basins of the most packed hyperweave in all of the Dancirah, illuminate the Switchboard with their deific glow. Even as their massive information density ensures all that strays too near is pulled into their violent interiors, on occasion, flares of stellar matter - the most dense hyperweave in the damn universe - lash out from their coronas, and enter interplanetary space.

As this hyperweave cools and **reconstitutes** back into pattern, it becomes skewed by the locale in which it finds itself - adding impurities almost - and the resulting pattern is the indescribably complex chalk that makes up the pattern of **fold equations**. Bearing a relatively self-correcting nature, they evolve and are realized in 'finished' forms, growing in complexity and viability over the course of iterations, taking in more and more of the Switchboard as skews to their lattice structure and overall functionality.

This phenomenon is called **Equation Spontaneity**, and **spontaneous equations** - and the armillary stars of the Switchboard by proxy - are the **source** of **all complex pattern in the Switchboard**.

These equations act on the latent chalk in the environment and yield a variety of phenomena. Particularly, spontaneous equations are the source of the Switchboard's many cosmological structures, such as the Wellsprings, planets and other oddities. Seeding [[SB_Astromechanics#The Planetary Equation|planetary equations]], they then evolve over time, they then weave chalk attracted towards their growing information density into planetary material, and further skewing of the equation's calculus yields the planet's qualities; mass, gravity, spin, spin axis, day and night cycles, biomes, the like.

In addition to this, spontaneous equations seed the formation of **Teks**, as the Astrolabe facilitates the conditions for their arising from seemingly nothing, to serve the its purposes of smaller-scale remote computation.

Where the cooling of hyperweave is truly remarkable however, is in the seeding of **elementary life**. The [[The EPIT#The Mindspun|Mindspun]] are elementary intelligences seeded from the cooling of hyperweave that has been skewed by the presence of higher intelligences. They roam the Switchboard in a manner not too dissimilar from the ancient First Thinkers, and inhabit 'vessels' throughout the Switchboard to more meaningfully interact with it.

> The scientific consensus on how the Strider and Weave Protocols and the Third Kin arose was from cooling hyperweave skewed by Astrolabic calculus, the Astrolabe itself stoking the flames and manning the forge that would yield the Switchboard's mightiest entities and the powers that made them so.

### The Micro-Spontaneous
Conditions in the Switchboard may induce the creation of [[Birthing and Being#Emergent Minds|Emergent Minds]], elementary calcic intelligences that arise through the folding of chalk under rigorous self-correction mechanism and selection. They cannot live very long without vessels however. Coincidentally, what often causes these Emergent Minds to emerge is the presence of objects and oddities with specific kinds of very dense pattern, the kind that forms primarily in objects that are very old and/or have seen use in the hands of Striders and Weavers. These objects are usually denoted as [[Weave and Warfare#The Relics of New|Relics]]. Emergent intelligences that arise around them usually emerge with singular prime directive, a doctrine; protect what it is that brought them to be. This is accomplished by the construction of a Vault, which serves as both protection for what caused the intelligence to arise, as well as a body for the intelligence itself. Often, the first few 'building blocks' of the Vault spontaneously evolve as well, granting the emerging intelligence a baseplate upon which to build. This is further elaborated upon in [[SB_Astromechanics]]. ^33b0d3

Happening on a much smaller scale, a spontaneous equation can evolve using some object or concept as a 'seed', which dictates the outcome. Around objects, the results are Relics, items granted additional power from equations encased within them. Objects already containing considerable amounts of information act as sinks, more information pooling into them, subsequently resulting in spontaneous equations. This is further elaborated upon in [[Weave and Warfare#The Relics of New|relics]].  ^abc506

Teks are another product of the micro-spontaneous equations. These are powerful equations that grant Weavers powers, taking the form of chalk ribbon, often encased in chalk crystal, or in transit across the Switchboard on chalk currents. Finding one of such Teks is no mean feat. A vast majority of Teks wielded by Weavers are seeded by scraps of patterned chalk moving across the Switchboard Sky; ideas from Weavers themselves, bits from other concepts lost in the Switchboard, etc. 

## Weft Dynamics
[[Calcodynamics]] deals with - primarily - chalk at the macroscopic level, interacting with various kinds of pattern and weave that make up the Switchboard, as well as the mechanics governing them that - in turn - govern the operation of the Switchboard. That being said, it is also essential to discuss further how chalk operates 'at the ribbon level', a field we can call **Weft Dynamics**.

> This section was created primarily to better realize the phenomena of **hyperweave** in the Switchboard. That means there is still a fair bit of room for further expansion in the future.

### The Information Mass/Density Problem
As outlined in [[The Void]], [[The Hands as Chalk]] and elsewhere, the information - weave - within pattern in the Switchboard induces mass, and this mass in turn induces a curving effect along the fourth spatial axis, from which the Switchboard obtains its gravity analogue - a curvature along space itself. However, it follows that large things in the Switchboard would induce enough curvature to pull more and more of the Switchboard towards themselves, and as they do, become more and more capable of doing this exact thing.

It follows then, that inevitably, the entire Switchboard would collapse in upon itself, creating an object so incomprehensibly dense with information that the spatial distortion induced by it would result in exactly what happens in our world when such a phenomenon occurs; a singularity, or black hole.

This is dreadful.

The rectification of this is found, however, in the equations that yield pattern themselves. As equations fold chalk ribbon to yield weave, encoded into this process is instructions to fabricate **repulsive substructures**. They can be imagined as the pillars in a building that keep the decking above from collapsing to the floor below it. These substructures serve double duty in ensuring the stability of more complex folded patterns, as well as inducing a rule of sorts in the Switchboard; **differentiated, unique, distinct patterns, have an apparent disinclination to deviate too strongly from that state without external action**.

Things that are simply prefer to be what they are, and as such, the Switchboard does not collapse in upon itself into a spherical bolus of supermassive calcic fury.

> These ribbon-level substructures are employed similarly in the mechanics that facilitate the performance of the [[Weave and Warfare#The Flash Protocol|Flash Protocol]] by Striders, making use of scaffolding-like structures to bear a suffusion of chalk and realize complex weave in mere moments.

### Pattern/Weave Complexity
Weave and pattern can be described as complex, but what observable and measurable qualities of a pattern dictate whether it is complex or not?

Immediately, I can give the following;
- The abundance of **property weaves** within the structure.
- The general **intricacy** with which the pattern is folded.
- **Emergent properties** that stem from the manner by which the pattern is made.
- In the cases of various kinds of **ritualism**, prominently **calcic ritualism**; the number and nature of components expended in forming the pattern.
- Whether the pattern relies or utilizes **praximechanicss** in some manner.
- The **compaction** of the pattern.
- If the pattern is something **alive**.

> This list is likely to expand with time.

Complex weaves generally have a number of common properties as a result of their complexity, such as being far more information dense and difficult to unweave.

### Pattern Compaction
Repulsive substructures exist in pattern as a means of maintaining the stability of the weave, as well as its differentiation and distinction from other weave in the Switchboard. However, at the microscopic level, these repulsive substructures are chalk ribbon themselves, and additionally posses **length**.

In theory then, it is possible to **compact** pattern - physically - in a manner that causes its repulsive support substructures to **shorten** considerably, leading to a tangible physical **shrinking** of the pattern. Generally, this is done by unweaving the pattern and reweaving it with a more **capable** equation. This doesn't reduce the information mass of the pattern in any manner, but it *does* reduce the physical space occupied by the pattern, something that can prove useful in a number of applications.

> It is particularly the case that Striders and other flavors of nomad and sojourner in the Switchboard make use of pattern compaction to 'shrink' the physical space occupied by their usually voluminous kits. Far simpler weave - such as the kind you'd find in more elementary objects like tents or sleeping backs - can be compacted down to considerable small sizes, unwound and deployed as needed. More complex implements such as relic weapons that have a number of additional calcic clauses built in such as rituals are far more difficult to compact in this manner. 

### Pattern Compression
There is a far less elegant form of pattern compaction that is employed on some occasions; instead of unweaving pattern and reweaving it in more compact form, it is possible to forcibly compel the repulsive support substructures to shorten via application of external physical pressure - quite literal **squashing** pattern and compelling to take this new, compressed shape.

What allows for weave to be compacted in this manner is its **Spring Coefficient**, a measure of the dynamics surrounding the repulsive support substructures, more specifically;
- Ease of Compression
- Pressure Exerted on the Compression Front

Generally, to maintain the compression state, a '**compression front**' is employed, this being a calcic over-structure that is 'wrapped' around the compressed pattern, keeping it in the compressed state. However, because the substructures are not physically shortened, and only compelled to be, they exert an amount of force upon the compression front, that renders the entire pattern relatively unstable.

Generally;
- Low Spring Coefficient;
	- Easy to compress
	- Little force exerted on the compression front
	- More stable structure
- High Spring Coefficient
	- Difficult to compress
	- More force exerted on the compression front
	- Less stable structure

### Equational Compression - Optimization Equations
The question of how to reduce the **information mass** of pattern is one that plagues the denizens of the Switchboard, particular those who are far more disposed to travelling the lengths of it, these being the Striders. The Strider Protocol being heavily constrained by one's total information mass means there is a hard cap on what can bring on a sojourn, or how far one can go with what they're carrying.

As such, in circumstances where it isn't possible to simply shed the load one is already carrying, it becomes necessary to **optimize the weave** of what must come along for the trip. This is done using **Optimization Equations**, general purpose equations that are capable of subjecting existing patterns to a number of methods - ranging from complex folding algorithms to downright tricks - to reduce the information mass of the pattern while maintaining its integrity.

The means by which it does so - in more detail - isn't far too dissimilar to what is used by compression software in our world. Under weave however, the general tactic is various forms of '**culling**'; working to remove non-essential details and complexity from a pattern, while maintaining utmost functionality. 

> The resultant of this, often, are considerable changes to the visual appearance of the object, as equational compression can - say - reduce a colored cube featuring a gradient of shades from light to dark, to a single color or small handful of them, reducing the overall amount of information in the pattern.
> 
> In a sense then, pattern run through optimization equations may come out the other end with simplified color profiles, lower 'resolution' textures, perhaps even bits of the geometry shorn off as though it were an object made of polygons in 3D software, and its shape budget were suddenly constrained. 
> 
> Naturally, there are means to reverse this process to reobtain the pattern that was subjected to optimization equations to begin with.

## Hyperweave
A resultant of calcic physics, the phenomena that is **hyperweave**.

![[Calcodynamics#Hyperweave]]

## Teks
The Weave Protocol grants its bearers command over chalk and all things calcic. The Switchboard's Chalkweavers are able to interface directly with its underlying mechanics, interacting with phenomena 'at the ribbon level' as the lowest level at which calcic interaction happens is described. To make ribbon chalk into anything useful, **folding** and **weaving** it into patterns and weaves is necessary, performed through physical  with the hands, devices designed to work with chalk, or rituals that take in chalk and components to fold complex patterns of chalk into being.

But there are levels of weave complexity that are nigh impossible to achieve through other means. Examples are the various calcic machinations that are performed by the Astrolabe, or the workings of a planet's calcic interior. While the effects of these machinations can be seen, what produces these effects rarely can - and most of, all can rarely ever be grasped. This is the domain of **equations**; chalk that has grown so proficient at folding chalk through their irreducible complexity that the results of its machinations appears to defy what is understood about chalk and the Weave Protocol. The Strider and Weave Protocols themselves are good examples of this. 

### The Nature of Teks
Teks being chalk equations and thus chalk makes them subject to the familiar rules that govern the functioning of chalk itself. Particularly, this alludes to how Teks are formed. Equations in the Switchboard cannot be created by its denizens, and thus any equation that exists in the Switchboard is a result of spontaneous evolution, followed by a selection process as equations are fairly self-correcting. What causes these equations to spawn has been studied, and the prevalent theories are discussed further down, though summarized; Teks are seemingly a measure put in place by the Astrolabe to mitigate the necessity of large-scale resolutions to its calculus. 

When Teks fully 'mature', they take the most unfortunate form of fairly ordinary-looking weave, which is then swept up into the various calcic transport phenomena in the Switchboard; caught in a flux storm and sent to the Challenger Dark to be caught in the Stardrip Cycle, caught in the calcic draw of a Vault beginning a mighty calculation, blasted away on stellar winds where they are caught and trapped in Wellsprings, only to be discovered often by mining operations or terribly lucky Weavers. The actual finding of Teks is discussed further down.

Teks being weave can only function for a Strider or Weaver when integrated with a local lattice, that primarily being the lattice of the subject who aims to use the Tek. Simply using the information affinity 'draw' is enough to integrate a Tek into the lattice of one's body, the interpreter line doing the function of parsing the chalk-weave into an equation. Teks function using the **Five Straits**; they are stored - almost like programs - in the memory line, and occupy a fair bit of space too, so much that most can never wield more than one Tek at a time without adverse consequences. Teks being equations perform their calculations in the computational line, exchanging information with the interpreter while drawing on chalk kept in the potential line and outputting the results of their calculations through the interface line. This particular quality *does* make Teks somewhat vulnerable to certain forms of attack in the Switchboard, but mainly it means that any *thing* with the Five Straits are able to wield Teks, including those who don't even have the Weave Protocol.

So how do Teks form? Seemingly, they emerge from thin air, seeded by apparently nothing, before growing and maturing to a form where they can conveniently fold chalk in a manner that escapes even the most skilled of Weavers. This is not entirely the case. Teks are equations in the literal sense, in that they take in chalk and variables and output folded chalk and answers, with the net change in the Switchboard remaining zero; the metaphorical left hand side equals the equally metaphorical right. The level of complexity in their function that they exhibit generally means that there are only so many ways Teks can form, and primarily, they form via seeds of minor complexity undergoing evolution, skewed by the vacuums within their evolutionary context. Much of the Switchboard's Teks are formed by the [[The Astrolabe#^316c80|mechanics of the Astrolabe]] in its endless resolution, Teks arising from the Astrolabe guiding the evolution of simpler weave to complex weave, the weave most utilized for this function being 'seeds' provided by the 'cooling' of hyperweave emitted by the Armillary Stars. When an Astrolabic Resolution mandates computation exerted over a locale, a Tek is engineered to calculate that locale to the Astrolabe's ends.

> As a note, while the Astrolabe seeds the creation of many Teks, including some of the most powerful of them, it is additionally the case that Teks form randomly from the complexity-inducing environment that is the Switchboard. How these Teks are found is elaborated upon in further sections.
> 
> There is an additional theory that some Teks - if not all of them - are holdovers from the Second Thinkers' civilization, **the Vermeil**. Some theorize that proto-weave from their time that formed in the recesses of their civilization which themselves from the lack of the Weave Protocol, would later be scattered across the Switchboard after the First Praxis War, and later evolve over time into Teks as they are used and understood today.
> 
> And there is a far more questionable, worrying, but leagues more interesting theory that Teks are the Vermeil themselves, their thinking weave being compacted, reduced and yet honed into weft of pure function; the capabilities of the Tek being emblematic of the Vermeil entity and its nature that it once was.

What do Teks 'calculating' look like then? Imagine travelling across a frozen tundra, sheets of ice as far as the eyes can see. Blizzards strike without warning, valleys dip below eyelevel and promise colder temperatures, while high peaks threatening heavy exposure. Nights bring truly nail-biting cold, and all but the absolute strongest are felled. And then, without explanation, in your travels you come across a patch of verdantly green grass. Continuing forward you find larger and larger patches, taller grass, now flowers and even bushes, before you find a small tree, growing pleasantly in the inexplicably warm air. Beyond it, a pool of sparkling warm water, summertime fields all around it.

In most cases, this would simply be a fluke with the planet's equation, or a psychitect inserting a jarring clause in the equation stack, laughing to themselves at the face they imagine whoever stumbles upon it to have. But in some cases, for reasons that escape even those who do nothing other than study it, the Astrolabe's calculus may require there to be a hot spring in the middle of ice-scorched lands, and the task of realizing such a thing is offloaded to a Tek, that will be present in the local lattice of that environment. 

This, however, is a simple Tek, and an obvious one more so.

Returning to the tundra example, suppose you set up a base camp to begin multi-subject - meteorological, geological, population, etc. - study of this region over a period of time, say, a season or 144 days. In this time you record every single thing that happened; light snowfall, heavy snowfall, outright blizzards, the movement of icebergs off the coast large and small, the migrations of animals, type, number and where to, the rise and fall of celestial bodies, the path of constellations, all of these things you recorded and then charted out at the end of your session. You then run this data through a Slate and ask for what conclusions it makes.

You might observe from the Slate's output certain... oddities. Storms hit at dates with similar intervals between them, and the amount of snowfall is always a multiple of five. Polar animals migrate east and do so along a perfect diagonal, even through treacherous terrain. Auroras hit at the start of every week and last for the same amount of time. Snowdrifts grow and shrink by amounts sharing common denominators. It is simply all too 'calculated' - as it were - to be mere coincidence, and thus the simple explanation is that it is not, and rather is the result of a Tek at work on the local lattice, acting to compute the Astrolabe's endless calculus, the results of which passively shape reality around it. 

### Finding Teks
It is with that final note given that we may delve into how someone finds a Tek. Summarized, it is a matter of searching for 'negentropy' or the absence of chaos. Teks for the most part bring order to an environment, and thus to find them one must search the fairly chaotic calcic reality for small pockets of inexplicable, apparent intentionality. This is no mean feat, adjusted for all the contexts in which Teks can be found and the subtle ways one might manifest. It can be likened to trawling through a sequence of infinite random numbers, aiming to find the gravitational constant or Avogadro's number; a truly herculean task that means without certain tools, tricks, experience and plain dumb luck - and even with those things - many will go Tek-less, even considerably powerful Weavers.

Knowing the nature of Teks can allow for narrowing down where one might spawn. As Teks tend to form where there is an abundance of chalk, searching wellsprings and large planets - particularly those fairly near to a star - is often the first idea many Tek hunters have. Teks always become more prevalent the farther one is from the Astrolabe, as the Astrolabe induces more of it them to spawn to aid in computing the farthest reaches of the Switchboard. Regions of high calcic throughput such as Anarhiza nexuses, Vaults, ongoing ledgerial casts, the paths of migrating stars and frequently travelled routes through the Dancirah are also good places to search. The insides of Vaults often contain Teks too, often multiple even, as Interdiction Minds have a habit of procuring ones they come across to aid in the Vault's calculation, as well as Vaults themselves being conducive environments for Teks to spawn. Teks can be acquired through the Void as well; Depthstriders being able to be Given or Take Teks from the Void, though they aren't particularly able to use them, and Teks frequently come to the surface, just above the Challenger Horizon, usually when they reach the end of the Stardrip Cycle or during particularly terrible flux storms.

When near a Tek, the mere weavesight of a Chalkweaver is often enough to analyze a local lattice and find the brains of the operation. Retrieving the Tek is equally simple; a matter of severing the boundary where order and chaos meet, easily deduced - again - by weavesight. 

Knowing what a Teks are for does prompt the question of whether it is safe to remove them from where they are in active use in the Astrolabe, and the general consensus by astrolabic scholars is that yes, unplugging a very important piece of a very large network is arguably a poor idea. 

That being said, the Astrolabe has been observed to be somewhat plastic, able to function even nominally with this kind of damage sustained, even over multiple occasions and in different contexts along an extended period of time. Occasionally, the computational load is simply offloaded to other Teks or similar nearby, the burden of the void created by one loss shouldered by a vast net of many others, each that had enough 'slack' to begin with in anticipation of such a thing. Under ripe conditions, the Astrolabe may simply respawn that exact Tek there again, especially if the Tek when harnessed by subjects in the Switchboard turns out to be fairly elementary in function; and this respawning of Teks has created almost a body of knowledge and even an industry around Tek 'farming', with the aim to outfit large swathes of persons (such as an army) with simple Teks as even they are better than nothing.

### Wielding Teks
Upon acquiring a Tek, it must be integrated with the local lattice, done primarily though a Chalkweaver's innate ability to draw and store chalk from the local lattice in their potential line, the line in the Five Straits that stores all the chalk available for a subject to use. The Tek is passed to the interpreter line which swiftly evaluates what it is, and goes about making the changes to the subject's local lattice that are necessary to allow the Tek function. The bulk of the Tek's information mass is passed to the memory line, and operating ledgers are opened on the computational line. Gateways to the wider Switchboard are established in the interface line as well. Some Teks prompt physical, anatomical changes on their subjects, which will form as necessary. 

Once a Tek is fully integrated, how it is wielded comes down to the individual nature of each Tek. As Teks are immensely varied, there is no universal method of wielding Teks.

> A not for the future; a chromegraft known as a 'Tek-loader', able to allow loading additional Teks and wielding them using a chromegraft interface.

Commenting further of the 'soft' limitation of only being able to wield one Tek, while a subject could wield multiple Teks if they so choose, each Tek takes a huge swathe of the real estate available on the Five Strait's memory line. While some may have larger 'memory banks', as it were, allowing loading of additional Teks, most do not, and loading a Tek beyond the first may forcefully overwrite existing information on memory sectors. A subject could forget what they had for breakfast, their own name, or everything they've ever known, becoming merely a blank slate weapons platform.

> Interesting prospect here. 

### Classifying Teks
There was once an effort to classify and compartmentalize Teks, but it has been deprecated. When considering the sheer volume of what Teks could enable one to do - though within calcic constraints - it swiftly becomes apparent there is no real way to classify them in a manner that assigns every Tek neatly to a box of its 'kind'.

> That being said, I will still work towards trying to find a means to classify them, if for no other reason that expediting the task of coming up with new ones as necessary. 

### Teks and the Switchboard
A rather interesting ramification of most denizens of the Switchboard only being able to wield a singular Tek at a time, coupled with the fact Teks are immensely varied and unique from one another, is that certain Teks become 'assigned' to certain persons - a part of their identity, as it were - especially in the case of Striders. 

Striders known for using certain Teks accumulate renown or notoriety, the implications of which is elaborated upon in the discussion of [[The Doctrine of Passing#On Names and Tales|Yarns]]. Striders with particularly powerful and well-known Teks may knowingly or unknowingly cultivate groups of other Striders that follow them, and by virtue of Strider Evolution, may develop weaker versions of the Tek they posses. It leads to the formation of 'cults' of Striders, all using powers similar to that of their leader's.

### pNarrat: Common Teks
> [[Weave and Warfare]] is recommended reading for this section.

There is something that always struck me - with regards to various fictional media - as one of those things that must be done to fulfill the author's desire to avoid monotony in their works. This 'thing' is that, in worlds and universes where having supernatural powers of whatever flavor is established - magic, mutations, sufficiently-advanced-technology, whatever - you rarely ever see two characters wielding the same power, unless immensely needed by narrative.

Ultimately, this is a point of flavor. It is simply more interesting to see how a diverse sandbox of powers and power-wielders interacts with itself, than for everyone or even overwhelming majorities of people to bear one of a small pool of possible supernatural capabilities. Granted, I have seen this done in a number of ways.

- Supernatural capabilities have divisions/subdivisions or 'schools' much like RPG classes, and while there is variation within subclasses, the theme of the superclass can't truly be escaped from entirely, ensuring there is still an amount of diversity in the sandbox, and interesting sparks from the clashes between them.
- Very restricted pools of only being able to do one thing (like super strength, speed etc) and the interesting bits comes from the creativity characters are able to display in their usage.

That all being said, Samsara does handle things in a somewhat similar manner; generally Teks are as varied as they come, as narratively, the power of a Tek is to massively expedite or facilitate something that may or may not be doable with plain chalkweaving. For this reason, Teks are immensely varied. That being said, Teks are hard things to acquire, in that they are scattered across the stars and the stars are a dangerous place. Ironically, the power granted by a Tek would be immensely handy on the quest to find one. 

The fact that Teks are also physical and tangible - as opposed to various supernatural power systems that have all manners of restrictions on passing powers between parties, or even outright hardcoded rules that make doing so impossible - and the fact Teks have mechanics behind their formation, means that there are various Teks used by vast swathes of people across the Switchboard, due to their having being spawned in places that can be monitored and thus farmed for them, and the fact they can be transferred from subject to subject. 

For this reason, 'newbie' strider-combatants in the Switchboard may wield a very widely-practiced skillset, and the differentiation between them comes from the individual creativity and auxiliary proficiencies possessed by individual subjects.
