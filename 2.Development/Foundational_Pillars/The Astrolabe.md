# The Astrolabe
Outlined most succinctly in the account of the Switchboard's origin;

![[The Dawn of the Dancirah#The Astrolabe]]

At the center of the Switchboard lies the Astrolabe, a colossal construct that stood at the beginning of the Switchboard before it even bore that name, Manifesting physically as a star-sized analogue computer-like construct of incomprehensible complexity, the workings of is **grand calculus** serves to dictate the very nature of the Switchboard, all the way down to the most elementary calcic mechanics. It is this significance that has earned the Astrolabe equal parts curiosity, reverence and often fear. Nonetheless, the mechanics of the Switchboard are - in a sense - the mechanics of the Astrolabe, plus making it necessary that there be a document to outline the many workings of the super-construct.

## The Origin of the Astrolabe.
> For now, there is no conclusive answer to this question.

## The Grand Calculus
The Astrolabe functions via its **calculus**. This calculus describes the seemingly pondering - the calculations - performed by the incomprehensible clockwork mechanisms that make up the entire astrolabic structure, as well as the result of those calculations as they are distributed throughout the entire Switchboard. The Astrolabe is - most simply - a colossal computer, who's input and and output have attained a universe's scale in size and complexity, and as such, the processing step in-between must exist similarly.

### Perpetuation
Scholars of the Astrolabe have set about studying the physical structure of the Astrolabe as well as the effects it yields in a bid to find out as much as they can about it, working to develop theories about its manner of operation. Chief amongst them, is that of the **Astrolabic Perpetuation**, a theory that the whether by pure coincidence, the product of a level of deep mathematics none can grasp, or by being guided by some external unknown force, the Astrolabe seems ardent about **perpetuating the Switchboard**.

In a sense, the Astrolabe's mathematics yields results that always bring about 'more Switchboard'. Should there be a hypothetical 'end state' of the Switchboard, a state in which all that there is comes to a standstill, the Astrolabe's calculus selects for outcomes that avoid this end state.

This has led many to question if the Astrolabe, in a sense, selects for **entropic outcomes**, and for the conditions necessary for **further increased entropy**. That perhaps, the Astrolabe's calculus tends the entire Switchboard towards grander states of disorder, for reasons still unknown.

### The Calculation Process
At the crux of the Astrolabe's Calculus is working towards a **resolution**. This is a change made to the Switchboard that is exerted over its entirety generally, or to localized spaces otherwise. **Astrolabic Resolutions** are the source of much study and ire in the Switchboard, as at their core, they are the very Switchboard gradually growing and changing in manners that may or may not be conducive to its denizens.

To begin the process, the Astrolabe first executes one of the many **subroutines** under its **Core Operational Protocols**, this particular one known as the **Reflexive**. The Reflexive is a time-bound subroutine that the Astrolabe calls upon to evaluate *itself*, triggered either through specific circumstances or after an amount of time on an internal clock has passed. The Reflexive takes a litany of measurements relating to the Astrolabe's function, but in particular it measures the **entropy generated** within the Switchboard since the last resolution cycle. Should a dynamically-selected threshold be surpassed, the Reflexive passes control over to perhaps the most senior of the subroutines, the **Resolver**.

The task of the Resolver is to parse all changes to the Switchboard made since the last resolution cycle and yield a new resolution or set of resolutions that fulfill criteria outlined by the Astrolabe, primarily that of the Perpetuation. The Resolver executes a number of sub-functions that serve towards fulfilling this end, with the **Index Subroutine** - the subroutine responsible for populating the Astrolabe's **ledgers** with information from the entirety of the Switchboard - being one of the most noteworthy. 

When resolutions are reached, they are inscribed into the Astrolabe's ledgers, and exerted upon the entire Switchboard via the Armillary Stars, in a manner elaborated upon later.

### Protocols
On occasion, the Resolver will have need to facilitate the ability to do something that is traditionally not possible with the current state of the Astrolabe's clockwork mechanisms, and as such, the only means forward is for the Astrolabe to engineer additional mechanisms of counterwoven barristeel, incomprehensibly complex gearworks that dictate and define the means of doing a thing into being. These are the **Protocols**. 

When the Resolver decides that something needs to be possible, a protocol is realized into being to make it happen. These protocols can be thought of as vastly elevated calcic equations that fold chalk in a manner that cannot be grasped, to facilitate changes in the Switchboard that permeate the entirety of its space, redefining the ledgers and the compute performed using them. Often, protocols can be 'tapped in to' or even outrightly *wielded* by denizens of the Switchboard towards their own ends, as protocols serve a double-duty of being **long-term, massive entropy generators**. 

On occasion, existing concepts or functions in the Switchboard are **elevated** to protocol-level status, to take on an astrolabic component in their nature. This allows their function to evolve beyond its initial make, and thus interact with the Switchboard in a manner similar to the Astrolabe's calculus.

### Computational Apparatus
Over the many processions counted by the Astrolabe and borne by the Switchboard, the Astrolabe has utilized various physical apparatus in the resolution of its calculus. Much like distributing a computational program across various machines to lighten the computational load on each individual machine, as well as hasten the overall completion of the task, the Astrolabe has similarly, across the ages, utilize other entities structures as **computational apparatus**, towards its end of computing the entirety of the Switchboard.

> [[The Dawn of the Dancirah]] is recommended preliminary reading for this section.

In the earliest before-times, the overall complexity of the Switchboard was low enough such that the Astrolabe alone was able to compute its entirety with minimal difficulty. The Switchboard and the Astrolabe existed in this manner for many, many processions, until the interactions of the various simple components of the Switchboard of then, accelerated by the radiance of elementary stars, proved sufficient to cause the resolution of calculus that caused the first thinking weave - the First Thinkers - to arise in the Switchboard. Guided by a **prime directive** to serve the Astrolabe, the collective swarm of the First Thinker entities served as the Astrolabe's first true **computational apparatus**.  

![[The Dawn of the Dancirah#^422bb4]]

![[The Dawn of the Dancirah#^e174c6]]

The Astrolabe's original **Index Subroutine** presented the problem of how merely observing how the Switchboard had changed, and relaying this information back to the Astrolabe, caused further colossal changes to the Switchboard in and off itself, resulting in the need for earlier resolutions of the calculus, as well as never allowing any resolution to truly 'resolve' the changes made to the Switchboard, as any changes implemented to the Switchboard were made outdated by the process of even concocting them. For this reason, Astrolabic calculus was stricken with endless inaccuracies and deficiencies - which the rise of the First Thinkers served to solve.

Many events spanned and defined the Dawn of the Dancirah, but in particular - and relevant to this subject matter - was the conclusion of the First Praxis War between the First and Second thinkers, the Vermeil. The scale of the catastrophe exceeded anything that had ever occurred in the Switchboard before, and the Astrolabe was forced to respond in kind, swinging the pendulum back in a colossal resolution that gave rise to its greatest creations yet;

![[The Dawn of the Dancirah#^4fd928]]

Our focus are the nine astrolabic spheres;

![[The Dawn of the Dancirah#^c13131]]

The nine astrolabic spheres formed served as a means to compute the now immensely chaotic Switchboard, and one astrolabic sphere alone was powerful enough as a computer to vastly outstrip the compute power of colossal swarms of the First Thinkers. As a response to the defection of their duty by the First Thinkers in part, and the fact the Second Thinkers the Astrolabe realized as their stand-ins didn't serve the purpose of acting as an alternative to the Index Subroutine, the resolution calculus resulted in something more purposeful and permanent; entire planets that would serve as secondary computers.

It is perhaps for the best that the astrolabic spheres arose when they did, as the rise of the Third Kin would herald in the most frenetic state of the Switchboard in all of its tenure. The build-up to the Second Praxis War and the war itself suffused bounteous quantities of pure chaos into the Astrolabe's compute queues, and without nine planet-sized assistants, it likely would've buckled under the compute load far earlier, and brought about the Refrain earlier than when it did.

But it didn't, and instead the Astrolabe lasted, the Reflexive running its circuit and seeing no need to call for the intervention of the Resolver. 

But it was only a matter of time, and eventually all the loans taken by the Switchboard of then would have to be repaid, done so in a cataclysmic resolution that would be called '**The Refrain**'.

![[The Dawn of the Dancirah#^897357]]

![[The Dawn of the Dancirah#^fbb884]]

![[The Dawn of the Dancirah#^0194e9]]

While the Astrolabe could compute the entirety of the Switchboard using the astrolabic spheres, it did not have any means for conveying imprints of the nature of the Switchboard back to itself as the First Thinkers had once done. For this reason, it had to utilize its Index Subroutine once again, on the largest scale it ever had, resulting in Switchboard-wide cataclysms that reshaped its landscape permanently. This was the Refrain.

What confused many, however, was that it was not entirely apparent what change or resolution the Refrain brought about. Not immediately anyway. Scholars of the subject would soon come to realize that the Astrolabe had rebuilt its own toolbox of how it performed the task of pulling information from the Switchboard and resolving it; by deploying an equation across the entirety of the Switchboard that transformed all of its stars into novel entities - the **Armillary Stars**, that obtained the power to take in imprints of the Switchboard for computation, and compute those inputs in line with astrolabic calculus, greatly reducing the compute load on the Astrolabe like never before, as well as ensuring the Reflexive won't call on the Resolver for a while, this change in particular bringing about the 'divine calm' that followed the Refrain, and assured the Third Thinkers that the world was stable enough for them to build upon permanently;

![[The Dawn of the Dancirah#^be3262]]

In addition to the Armillary Stars, the Astrolabe began utilizing greatly empowered equations - **Teks**, as they are more commonly known in-verse - to perform smaller scale computation in more targeted contexts. Teks further aided in the postponement of the Resolver-call by the Reflexive, as Teks further reduced the burden on the Armillary Stars. Astrolabic mechanics working alongside the mechanics of spontaneous equations give rise to Teks exactly where they are needed, further facilitating the Astrolabe's computation. Much of difference between what prompts the Astrolabe to seed the formation of a star or a Tek is a matter of focus and 'reach'; generally, the scope of the computation that needs doing informs the apparatus deployed to do it. Teks work excellently in reconciling local mathematics, focusing to resolve specific calculus, while stars serve the function of exerting the Astrolabe's influence over the entire Switchboard. ^316c80

What is meant by 'reach' and 'exerting influence' requires us to dive into the mechanics of **ledgers**.

## Ledgers
The Astrolabe's calculus is performed upon **imprints** taken of the Switchboard, immensely complex calcic 'mirrors' of the slice of the Switchboard from which they are taken. The Astrolabe, however, cannot perform computation on the imprints as-is, and instead their contents need to be separated and sorted into distinct categories. These categories take the shape and form of the **Astrolabic Ledgers**, constructs of chalkweave that record the **ontology of the Switchboard**.

The ledgers of the Switchboard are faultless records of all that is and occurs in the Switchboard. For every thing, entity, concept, phenomena, person, idea, space, power - everything - there is an associated ledger that records all that there is to do with it; its nature, all that it does and is done to it - everything. The result of this rigorous recordkeeping is the raw material the Astrolabe's Resolver Subroutine utilizes in its calculus to produce resolutions.

The creation and inscription of ledgers is handled by a protocol-level function; the **Ledger Protocol**, a function made manifest in the Astrolabe's cosmic brass-works that take in, digest, index and store colossal imprints of the entire Switchboard in the form of the largest calcic library that has existed alongside - and perhaps even *is* - time itself; the **Current**. The Calcic Current as it is most commonly known, is a sea of ledgers, connecting the Astrolabe, the Armillary Stars, and every and all things that have and currently dwell within the Switchboard.

### Ledgerial Mechanics
Outlined in the following are the various mechanics related to the Switchboard's Ledgers.

#### Indev: Ledger Classes
Based on the calcic information inscribed within, there are two major classes of ledger;

- **Indexer Ledgers**; that store what is recorded to them.
- **Astrolabic Ledgers**; ledgers that store what is recorded to them, but the information recorded to them has been done such that it can be **exerted**.

#### Writing to Ledgers
There are number of actions and phenomena that prompt the Ledger Protocol's **Inscription Subroutine**. Generally, any action performed within a **Ledgerial Space** will trigger the inscription subroutine to encode it in the appropriate ledger. Occurrences in ledgerial spaces generally write to Indexer ledgers, as these are primarily records of things that are, and happen.

Far more complex means of interacting with calcic reality that occur in ledgerial spaces, however, may prompt the inscription subroutine to write to an Astrolabic ledger. Of note, the most common prompters of astrolabe-level inscriptions are
- **Ledgerial Ritualism**
- **Praxis Vows**

> Link these to Chalk Ritualism and SlateMind.

### Ledgerial Spaces
The Switchboard operates under a considerable number of mechanics that have been outlined to varying degrees in this and other documents. Some of these mechanics - particularly foundational ones relating to the nature of chalkweave - exist and function as a matter of course, being mechanics that precede the Astrolabe itself. Others, however, are products of the Astrolabe and thus *not* inherent to the ontology of the verse. The means by which mechanics devised by the Astrolabe are appended to the foundational mechanics of the verse is necessarily via chalk, and as such, any effect the Astrolabe has on calcic reality is by *weaving those effects* into calcic reality.

To do this of course, requires something capable of exuding effects, or rather, something capable of emanating the resolutions of the Astrolabe as [[Calcodynamics#Inductive Weave|Inductive Weave]] upon calcic reality nearby, such that all calcic interactions occurring within a context are summarily skewed by top-level calculus facilitating or constraining what can be done, this *particular* bit made possible by the praximechanicss of the Astrolabe in espousing a doctrine of perpetuation, allowing it to supersede most other doctrines it acts upon.

Weave being material, however, means that there is a tangible limit to how far inductive weave can travel before losing its integrity, and the far simpler fact that the ability for weave to travel in the Switchboard is passively curtailed by the existence of the Void. As a result, anything capable of emanating inductive weave can only do so over a given area.

What is emanated - Astrolabic Resolutions - are encoded in the Astrolabic Ledgers, and the apparatus necessary for exerting the contents of the Astrolabic Ledgers have these ledgers fed to them through the Current. The region of the Switchboard that these emanating apparatus operate upon is thus called a **Ledgerial Space**. The Astrolabic mechanics of the Switchboard only function within the ledgerial spaces of the Astrolabe.

#### Further Notes
In the before-times, the Switchboard was simple enough that the Astrolabe alone was more than capable of exerting its ledgerial influence over its entirety. The effective range of a constructs ledgerial influence is determined by some major factors;
- The raw **calcic output** of the construct
- The **calcic density** of the given area upon which it aims to exert ledgerial influence

With more chalk present in the environment, the more raw calcic output a construct that means to exert ledgerial influence over that environment must posses - and the smaller the ledgerial space it can create should it be unable to meet this output demand. 

As the Switchboard gradually grew more complex, and generally filled with more stuff, the Astrolabe became increasingly less capable of exerting its ledgerial influence over its entirety, thus resulting in a gradual weakening and breakdown of Astrolabic mechanics. It rectified this by **elevating** certain cosmological constructs such as the First Thinkers Mind Nexuses, and later on, the Armillary Stars to being capable of exerting the Astrolabe's ledgerial influence on its behalf, the Astrolabic ledgers necessary for this task conducted to these constructs via the Calcic Current.

This means that in the modern Switchboard, much of the Astrolabe-fabricated laws only function **within the ledgerial space exerted by the Armillary Stars**. Fortunately, the Switchboard is filled with stars, and the Astrolabe's Resolution cycles create more as the case may be. This does mean, however, that should one find themselves in a region on the outer fringes of the stars of the Switchboard - or worse, gone beyond the sight of the stars entirely, then they will be subject to increasing degradation of the stringent reinforcement of the Astrolabe's laws, to the extent that they eventually stop working entirely.

> DT_Revisions: Excerpt here about the edge of the Switchboard. [[SB_Astromechanics]]

The imperfect distribution of stars throughout the Switchboard has created pockets and cavities where the ledgerial space of one star thins or ends and another star isn't there to cover for it. These **Starless Sectors** where stars do not reach thus suffer from mildly or greatly diminished compliance with Astrolabic laws, and in this vacuum, new phenomena emerge as a result, as well as old concepts behaving in new, lopsided manners.

### Erecting Ledgerial Spaces
The most common form of ledgerial space is one where a central emitting structure exerts ledgerial influence over a locale. This is the mode of the Astrolabe and the armillary stars, the foremost constructors of ledgerial spaces in the Switchboard. 

However, there is another form of ledgerial space that makes use of erected **boundaries**;

![[Extended Disciplines#Ledgerial Space Erection]]

## pNarrat: The Astrolabic Superstructure
> [[SB_Astromechanics]] is recommended reading for this section.

Resting at the center of the Switchboard, quiet but always working, is the Astrolabe. Built primarily of barristeel and its alloys, from near and far the Astrolabe dominates the Great Sky as a burnished gold instrument defying all preconceived notions about the sizes of things allowed to or even capable of existing in the Dancirah. So large is it, that parts of its clockwork infrastructure has been made habitable by the denizens of the Dancirah, particularly for those who have tasked themselves with studying and defending the Astrolabe, as well as serving as the staging grounds for incursions into the Astrolabe itself.

### The Astrolabic Cradle
As of the modern Switchboard times, the Astrolabic Cradle consists of the Astrolabe, the debris-belt formed by the annihilation of the nine astrolabic spheres during the Refrain, and a series of other planets, wellsprings and exoplanetary structures such as DevitNet infrastructure, free-standing space ports and fleets of starships. The Brass Monastery in particular maintains a marked presence in this space, with fleets, defensive installations and barriers installed to maintain total control of what is allowed to reach the Astrolabe.

Some distance beyond the final celestial bodies that make up the Astrolabic Cradle, the Near Armillary Rim begins. This is where the Switchboard's armillary stars begin, and extend outwards encompassing the vast majority of Switchboard space.

Outside of the boundary of the Astrolabic Cradle, the Sil'khan maintain a considerable fleet presence. In their canon, the Astrolabe, astrolabic spheres, the Old Danseers and the Skydancers, and them are all connected, and as such they treat the Astrolabe and its environs as a hallowed place, and many Sil'khan from near and far come to visit the locale that birthed their ancestor-kin.

### The Astrolabe Structure
The Astrolabe is a stratified structure defined by **hollows** and **barriers**. Hollows can - under circumstances - be traversed within by the denizens of the Switchboard. Barriers must be breached by some means to gain access to the layers below, either through physical means or calcic ones.

### The Outer Astrolabe
On the outer reaches of the Astrolabe's structure are the **Orrery Rings**, and the first barrier, the **Wisher's Grave**.

**The Orrery Rings**
Surrounding the spherical behemoth of the Astrolabe are three titanic barristeel rings that rotate along their planes and spin on an axis, large enough to berth large spacecraft and even build small settlements. Unaware of their true purpose - if any at all - many believe they serve as apparatus used in the Astrolabe's grand calculus. Many still however, particularly the Sil'khan, believe that the Astrolabe anticipated denizens of the Switchboard coming to pay homage to it in religious fervor, and thus lay out prayer mats for them to be received. 

The sheer calcic density and radiance from the orrery rings and the Astrolabe in general has made dwelling there for too long fairly inadvisable, and while many have chipped bits of barristeel from the rings in hope of using it for whatever purpose it might have, such as in ritualism, they find to their dismay that the barristeel reverts to a 'dormant' or even ore state that has been dubbed **barristone**, and serves little use beyond already existing, more traditional materials, or as a keepsake or souvenir.

**The Wisher's Grave**
The first of the Astrolabe's structural barriers, the Wisher's Grave, so called as many imagine that the wishes of the many denizens of the Switchboard collide with this barrier and go no further, having little effect on the calculus that takes place deeper into the Astrolabe. This barristeel alloy barrier is penetrable by physical material breaching apparatus, and this is the means of gaining entry to the layers below. 

The barristeel barrier itself - perhaps as a result of the wishes tossed at it - has accumulated all manners of flourish to its face. Much like the inscrit practiced by the Sil'khan, the Wisher's Grave has been covered with square kilometers of relief carvings, abstractly depicting what is assumed to be every wish ever tendered by those who dwell in the Switchboard. For many, the existence of the Wisher's Grave has convinced them that there is no real way to skew the Astrolabe's calculus, and while some have derived some manner of comfort from this fact, others have moved to much darker dispositions, ranging from depressive slumps to irate anger to existential terror.

### The Inner Astrolabe
Passing the Wisher's Grave grants one entry into the Astrolabe proper. The heaviness of ledgerial weight upon one's shoulder makes impossible any deviation from the proper function of calcic mechanics, and many who've walked the halls of what lie below report feeling the shape of something unfamiliar - or not native - to the Dancirah. This section is made up of the first hollow, the **Hollow of the Ministrations** and the second barrier, the **Canticle Summit**.

**The Hollow of Ministrations**
Descending from the Wisher's Grave, one will descend through a region in space where the physics has been skewed by factors unknown. The air here behaves more like water, with strange gravity in effect, resulting in the ability of those who enter this hollow to effectively 'swim' through space.

Dominating the architecture of the Hollow is an endless sea of machinery and engine components. Gears and cogwheels meshed together, shafts and axles the size of marble columns, pulleys and belts stretching for miles, bearings for smoothing rotation, couplings for transferring it, clutches for deciding when, flywheels for storing it. With no apparent rhyme or reason to this space, one is free to swim through this sea of machine parts, each vastly larger than a person. And on occasion, without explanation, parts will suddenly assemble into something of a cohesive whole, and become a raging flurry of motion. As with very much else, it is assumed to be the result of astrolabic calculus.

**The Canticle Summit**
The second barrier, one that manifests as a colossal - perhaps even infinite - library. It is believe by many that the Calcic Current originates from here, spun into quasi-existence by incomprehensible apparatus that sit atop the exalted mountain peaks of barristeel and alloy that define this strata. 

Filling the valleys are shelves and shelves of the canticles of every being and phenomena to have ever lived and occurred in the Switchboard; the ontological ledgers that record and define into being all that is. Without explanation, none of these ledgers can be opened or tampered with in anyway, not even with powerful calcic ritualism, with no explanation for why forthcoming, much to the frustration of Astrolabe scholars.

Therein lies an exception however; should one find their own ledger, they still cannot open it or tamper with it, but with it, they are able to pass the Canticle Summit barrier and proceed to the levels below.

Many report the Canticle Summit to be filled with speech and song, but with no speakers or singing. It is suspected that it is the tomes - the ledgers - themselves are responsible for this.

### The Final Frontier
The criteria for reaching the final frontier of the Astrolabe's strata being searching what is effectively an infinite library for a single book has made it such that precious few have actually gone this far. 

**The Barristeel Strut-lands**
Upon entering this layer, one is immediately struck by the immense gravity and heat characteristic to it, a major problem as entrants are flung immediately to the surface, a surface dominated by an expanse of molten barristeel, and branching tree-like struts of barristeel emerging from the molten slurry. Finding a safe place to land here is nearly impossible, and spending much time here at all is greatly inadvisable, due to the crushing gravity, sweltering heat and the sheer quantity of calcic radiance being output from all directions.

A veritable forest, there is not much to see in the strut-lands, it never deviating too greatly from its default state of a river of golden fire, spindly metal fingers like a man's hand reaching out from the deep. Cutting the struts themselves yields more molten matter, and those who stayed long enough to do anything by way of science observed that the struts appeared to be growing.

Of interest to many however, are the boluses of light that seemed to grow on some of the branches of the barristeel struts. Emanators of pure calcic radiance, even approaching them from afar resulted in a lattice scrubbed of all that differentiated it from the rest of the Switchboard. On a singular occasion, however, it was observed that these spheres of light occasionally detached from the struts, and took flight, travelling above the strut-lands and past the barrier above, leading many to conclude that the strut-lands were, in fact, a garden - or an orchard more precisely - and that the barristeel trees within it produced young stars as fruit.

**The Valley of Dry Tomes**
The final barrier-strata of the Astrolabe, and among the simplest. Past and under the molten metal seas of the layer above, the Valley of Dry Tomes proffers those who reach it only a flat expanse of books with no pages, all having been ripped out by... none can say. This field of book spines is only as inexplicable as what lies beyond it, as none have figured out a means to pass the Valley of Dry Tomes.

The Switchboard's denizens - for the most part - have accepted that there is a limit to where even the most adventurous nomads and star-roamers of the Dancirah can go.

### The Star Corridor
Beyond the Valley of Dry Tomes barrier is the Star Corridor. Where the name for this place originated is unknown, but without explanation, all know that at the center of the Astrolabe lies the construct known as the Star Corridor.

As the Valley of Dry Tomes cannot be breached, there is nothing known about the Star Corridor. Theories abound, but nothing conclusive.

It is the final mystery of the Switchboard.
