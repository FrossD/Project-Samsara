# Arsenal Card: Riftlock Blakk
Depthstrider Blakk, Rogue Riftlock and former Master of Artifice for a Veiled Daughter enters the battlefield. Her attunement with the Depths and frequent supplication to the Amaranth Sultan through feats of innovation and engineering has granted her a vast, blessed toolbelt of unrivalled versatility. Specializing in command of various **technological relics**, there is no situation she cannot meet head-on. Her high command of **spatial techniques and vows** as a true descendant of the Void grants her otherworldly powers as well, seeing to it that no foe is left with a means to escape.

## T0 - Martial Disciplines
Service in the Void and the Daughter's courts has exposed the Riftlock Blakk to a variety of the Void's disciplinary offerings, and going rogue has made them privy to a fair bit more. Favoring the brutality that overt measures allow, Blakk has translated this to their martial doctrines. A long life spent in workshops, however, has worked against them in this respect.

### Innate
**(N/A)**

### Practiced
- The Path of Oninan Monks and Giants - **Oninan Path**
*"It translated surprisingly well to swinging oversized wrenches."*

- The Methods of Travelling Savants - **Trevelyan's Principles on Confrontation**
*"I fancy myself a Treveler of sorts, a traveling tinker, a purveyor of all things odd and mechanical."*

### Novice
- Vahnkin Infantry Weapons and Warfare Doctrine - **Vahnkin War-making**
*"I value it more so for how it has exposed me to battle in general."*

## T1 - Void-Enhanced Armament
### Given Armament
**Rift Vibrokhopesh** - Curved Sword
*"All who say I betrayed the Daughter I served are liars. I was loyal, decorated, and left as such. Here is the proof."*
	A curved length of hardened pale amara mocks an axeblade as it takes the form of a sword. Along its length are carved scripture from the Depthstone Codices, and its handle, fine leather wrapped around the full-tang crystal. In the hands of a Depthstrider, it strafes this realm and the other.

- Offensive
**Blakk's Breaker** - Brch, Cado, Siph, Unrav, Induc
Axle: Formshift | Re-Innovate
Axle: Gifts and Possessions of the Void | Radial Blast Shield
*"The Daughter gave me a charge; 'go, show them the depths of the Void; the all-encompassing wrath therein'."*
	Blakk strikes her **Radial Blast Shield** with her **Rift Vibrokhopesh** as if beating a gong, releasing a catastrophically damaging spatial explosion in the vicinity. This explosion breaches armor, pierces, siphons chalk from all caught in the blast radius, and inflicts heavy unravelling, suppressing further chalkweaving. All struck are additionally hit with a powerful inductive stun.
	- The efficacy of this ability scales with the level of **Momentum Conduit** on the Rift Vibrokhopesh.
	- This ability can only be used once, as it **destroys** the Radial Blast Shield, requiring it to be summoned again.
 
- Utility
**Momentum Conduit**
*"You know it's working when it starts singing."*
	 The Rift Vibrokhopesh shunts constantly between the Dancirah and the Challenger Dark, its blade thus being a densely-contained piece of crystal with immensely high momentum. With a touch, it can impart this momentum on structures receptive to it. The momentum with which the Rift Vibrokhopesh vibrates **scales** with the **hack counter**.

### Taken Armament
**Crash Spanner** - Quarterstaff
*"Percussive maintenance is the term you're looking for; I am not just 'smashing things'.*"
	A rough, dark metal spanner roughly the height of it's wielder, carried and used as a quarterstaff. Put into spin, it is capable of delivering crushing blows to man and machine alike.
 
- Offensive
**Gravstrikes** - Brch
*"Force is mass times acceleration."*
	Blakk uses their powers of curvature manipulation to rapidly accelerate the end of their weapon, allowing them to inflict brutally crushing blows.

- Defensive
**Interceptor Spin**
*"I stuck a finger in there once. Still haven't found it."*
	 Blakk throws the Crash Spanner ahead of them and uses curvature manipulation to spin it rapidly in the air, blocking oncoming projectiles. Sturdier attacks can interrupt the spin, and thus it is not effective against them.

### Forged Armament
**(N/A)**
*"In time."*

## T2 - Curvature Manipulation
### Force Manipulation
**Calculated Assembly**
*"80% of the screws make it into the finished product. A passing grade by all metrics. I pride myself on doing more with less."*
	If Blakk has the component parts, and is aware of the internal workings of an object, such as through a blueprint, they can use their powers of attraction and repulsion to spontaneously assemble it. 

**Calculated Disassembly**
*"I think we should just outlaw glue actually. I think people who use glue should be forced to drown in the violet."*
	If Blakk knows the internal workings of an object, such as through a blueprint. They can use their powers of attraction and repulsion to spontaneously disassemble it.

**Rapid Disassembly**
*"The road to engineering that lasts is paved with the bodies of apprentices that didn't."*
	Blakk is able to use a rough assumption of the innerworkings of something to spontaneously disassemble it in the space of a finger snap. This can result in damage to the workings of the target, however.

### Selective Action
**Bangle Box**
*"The Daughter's courts enforced a real nuisance of a dress code. I had to wear jewelry. I've never been a fan of it; it's small, fiddly, jams up stuff, and I kept losing it. But this helped."*
	Blakk's Selective Action allows her to filter metal from non-metal, using the divine calculus of the Amaranth Sultan. Metals are attracted to her, and non-metal pushed away.

### Paired Points
**(N/A)**

## T3 - Draws From The Void
### Gifts and Possessions of the Void
**Cache of Contraptions**
*"A visiting Daughter once asked the one I served, 'What kind of people survive in the Dark?'. The question was posed to me instead. What I said then is what I'll say now; the punchers, the runners, the Void has them plenty, both on the fields and under them. But the thinkers? The thinkers last. I have chosen to be a thinker."*
	Lurking just under the local Horizon is Blakk's Cache of Contraptions, their personal toolbelt of answers to every question. By carving a rift and reaching into the depths, they can retrieve a contraption and deploy in battle as they see fit. With their Formshift, they can manipulate the nature of each contraption to ensure they are always ready for whatever the Switchboard brings.

**Contraption #1 - Strafe Boosters**
*"By eliminating the need to walk, we raised workshop efficiency by 35%. The number of workshop incidents increased as well during this period, but I am certain it is unrelated."*
	Retrofitted Fel-Arcad competitive rocketskates expand upwards to the waist with layered armored plate, spring-reliant shock absorbers, redundant gyro sensors and accelerometers, and high-throughput exhaust vents. With them, Blakk gains considerable mobility.
 - Utility
**Cruise Control**
*"nnnnnnneeeeaaaAAAARRRROOWWW"*
	Blakk gains the ability to hover above the ground as well as a considerable boost to speed, allowing them to skate rapidly across the battlefield, repositioning to dodge attacks or launch them.
 - Offensive - Skew
**Blast Hack**
*"Whiplash builds character."*
	Additional boosters are fitted to the back of the Strafe Booster assembly, and the internal enginery is replaced with a high-capacity battery. Blakk's hovering and passive mobility are disabled, in favor of bursts of high speed and maneuverability after the battery is charged. For brief moments, Blakk can move at speeds close to that of sound, but they are balanced by downtimes of needing to recharge.
 - Utility - Skew
**Featherlight Hack**
*"Its both more and less fun than you'd think."*
	Curvature-inducing retrofits are built into the booster assembly, allowing Blakk to use them to fly. While vertical movement is fairly swift, horizontal movement is mildly curtailed. 

**Contraption #2 - Repulsor Plate**
*"Its a little heavy on the upper-body, and it certainly isn't the best thing in my wardrobe, but I'd be dead and gone without it."*
	Depthstone-impregnated particle suspension chambers controlled by proximity sensor lattices, interlaced with chainmail, solid plate and featherlight padding creates a void-attuned breastplate capable of defeating all manners of threats.
- Defensive
**Gossamer Barricade**
*"I can tune it to even repel air."*
	The Repulsor Plate uses user-tunable threat detection algorithms to induce repulsive pockets of force to repel incoming threats. It boasts considerable utility against projectiles, and even attacking personnel can be kept well beyond arm's length.
- Offensive - Skew
**Slam Hack**
*"It genuinely never stops being funny."*
	The Repulsor Plate is refitted with a battery. When charged, it analyzes all targets in local space and selects according to parameters most likely to be met by a human target. It then induces a considerable repulsive force right under them, launching them into the air, followed by an even more intense attractive force that pulls them back down, slamming them into the ground. This attack has an internal cooldown dictated by the Repulsor Plate's battery.
- Utility - Skew
**Cloak Hack**
*"There are times I've used it while sitting at my desk, and watched as people stumble around my office, files in hand, wondering if they should drop them or go look for me. But I usually get caught, often from laughing too hard."*
	Local manipulation of air allows for distorting the form, interfering with observation mechanisms ranging from mundane visuals to Chalkweaver Weavesight.

**Contraption #3 - Assault Gauntlets**
*"It's very straightforward."*
	From the shoulders to the fingertips are reticulated metal plates fastened and layered, servos constraining the imperfect twitches of the arm. Force-multiplying motors grant strength to every movement, and lashed to the forearms are twin-barrel machine guns; the answer to many a stupid question.
- Offensive
**Barrage** - Cado, Siph
*"Very, very straightforward."*
	Blakk takes aim and fires a barrage of pale amara projectiles. They pierce and siphon chalk from the targets they strike, empowering Blakk as a denizen of the depths.
  - Offensive - Skew
**Napalm Hack** - Induc, Siph
*"Let 'em stew.'"*
	The twin machinegun barrels are cycled out in favor of a nozzle, and a canister is fitted to the back. Blakk can blast dense swathes of incredibly hot flames at close targets, incinerating them and inflicting heavy inductive burn, as well as siphoning their calcic reserves.
 - Offensives - Skew
**Bludgeoner Hack** - Brch
*"I am under oath to not share the formula for the rocket boosters. That being said, I take my coffee with milk, two sugars, a measure of stardrip, tritanium powder, supercooled-gallium, yellow dye #5, sawdust and burnt kacherock."*
	Blakk's gauntlets are refitted with spiked alloy shielding on the fingers and various housings and nozzles on the wrist and elbow. These housings store void-renewed rocket enginery, which fire out through the nozzles and produce considerable thrust. These rockets are triggered by Blakk's movement, firing when they detect an action interpretable as a thrown punch. Each punch of Blakk's is thus accelerated by rocket propulsion, and the Boost Bludgeoners are capable of punching through solid metal.
 - Offensive - Skew
**Grappler Hack** - Induc
*"If I really focus, I can pluck a hair off a beard. Usually I just break a nose."*
	The gauntlets are refitted with repulsion-capable apparatus and high-strength chain, allowing for launching the arms and retracting them. Should they strike a target, Blakk can reel them in while they are unable to resist due to a heavy inductive stun. If they fire at an object, they can reel it towards them, or reel themselves towards it.
- Offensive - Skew
**Railgun Hack** - Brch, Cado, Unrav, Prax
Axle: Formshift | Re-Innovate
*"Tuned. Over-tuned possibly. Maybe more than possibly. Almost certainly. I might have been asked to stop using it."*
	Blakk holds both arms parallel and aims at a target, while the thermal capacitors in the gauntlets begin to charge. At full capacity, they fire a depthstone projectile with ludicrous velocity, piercing and breaching armor and inflicting heavy unravelling on targets hit by it.
	Additionally, the damage done by the railgun scales with the **hack counter**; the number of active hacks on currently active contraptions. At **five stacks**, the railgun gains a praxis component to its damage, and deals additional damage against **those who hold ill sentiment towards the things of the Void**.

**Contraption #4 - Breach Visors**
*"Helps me keep track of loose screws."*
	Cross-spectra sensorial apparatus mounted to the windows of the spirit grants the wearer optical prowess. The language spoken by all things, the evangelism inherent to things that exist, becomes the domain of the one gifted sight.
	- Blakk's Breach Visors cannot be given hacks. Instead, as they are innovated upon, they add to an internal, separate hack counter of how many times they have been innovated, which scales the effectiveness of the Breach Visors. It still, however, contributes **one point** to the **hack counter**.
	- Blakk's Breach Visors additionally take **two** Innovation Charges to summon.
- Utility
**Artificer Vision**
*"Follow the data. Find the answer."*
	The Breach Visors enhance other components of Blakk's loadout;
	- **Strafe Boosters: Blast Hack** can be chain-triggered into itself five times, granting Blakk the ability to perform five bursts of immense velocity that decays with time, allowing instantaneously changing direction.
	- **Assault Gauntlets: Barrage** and **Railgun Hack** have greatly increased accuracy. Additionally, the scaling damage from stacking the **hack counter** on the Railgun Hack is **uncapped.**
	- **Assault Gauntlets: Grappler Hack** can now send hyperweave careening down its length, dealing devastating damage to any at the end of the hook.
	- **Repulsor Plate: Slam Hack** can now discriminate between targets at Blakk's discretion.
	- Blakk's **Draw Strike: Hazard Drawer** sees additional modifications;
		- Twice as many missiles are spawned, and they home more aggressively on targets.
		- The blinding flash and stunning sonic follow-up is additionally accompanied by a wave of curvature distortion, flinging all targets backwards a considerable distance.
		- The shower of oil is mixed with additional compounds, producing a larger explosion.
	- Blakk's **Innovation Charge** gain from using her Formshift is **tripled**.
  
- **Contraption #5 -  Radial Blast Shield**
*"Doubles as an umbrella."*
Otherwise dull metals are melted and fused to form pristine alloy, and the incants of the dwellers in the Dark, the riftlock arbiters of the Deep, and the daughter-born scorn-bearers of the Sky are stamped into its make. Around its edges are a lip of violet amara, metal and ash gathering on its vertices, effused from the underwhere. When gripped with the conviction implicit to its making, blackened sheets unfurl in a spiral, granting shape to the buckler. Its lattice quakes at the ever-present possibility of its own unmaking.
	Tooled in the depths of the Void, Blakk's **Radial Blast Shield** is an implement that promises supreme protection against the threats of the Switchboard. Taking form as a forearm-mounted stack of plates, with a gesture the plates unfold outwards into a stalwart round-shield built for mitigating attack.
	- Rather than being Re-Innovated under Blakk's **Formshift: Innovation Routine**, the Radial Blast Shield can only be summoned **after all four others of Blakk's Contraptions are active**, requires **having more than 20 innovation charges**, and is always in **hacked** state, adding one point to the hack counter. Using the powers provided by the Radial Blast Shield adds **virtual charge** to the hack counter, building it beyond cap.
	- The Shield, however, consumes a number of **innovation charges** to perform its abilities, and is returned to the Void when the innovation charge counter is depleted to **twenty charges**.
- Offensive
**The Iron Shoulder** - Brch
*"Please remember that teeth are small objects and are expectedly a choking hazard."*
	Blakk charges and then rams a target frontally with the full brunt of the Radial Blast Shield. Upon impact, depth manipulation apparatus within the shield repel the target with ludicrous force, shattering defenses and sending targets flying.
	- This ability consumes **3 Innovation Charges**.
- Defensive
**The Iron Vortex**
*"For shop cleanups. Very good at handling broken glass."*
	Spinning the Radial Blast Shield invokes spatial manipulation power within the alloy of its make, causing a swirling vortex to emerge that leads straight to the Challenger Dark. Projectiles are yanked off-course into the shield, allowing Blakk to greatly nullify the efficacy of ranged opponents. 
	- This ability consumes **5 Innovation Charges**.
- Defensive
**The Iron Shell** - Cado, Brch
*"For when you realize far too late that you cut the fuse far too short."*
	Blakk raises the Radial Blast Shield high and summons forth additional alloy plating from the depths of the Void, assembling a hemispherical armored shell at a position of her choosing. This shell is built with layers of reactive plating, that explosively shed armor plates when struck, effectively mitigating many attacks so long as they aren't focused to a single point.
	- This ability can summon a structure with **four stages** (four layers of armor), each stage costing **7 Innovation Charges** to summon.
	- This ability takes some time to cast, during which Blakk is vulnerable.
- Defensive
**The Iron Rebuttal** - Cado
*"Nothing quite like seeing gears mesh so nicely together."*
	Blakk performs a swipe with the shield, with the aim of wholly nullifying an attack. Performed perfectly, the attack is nullified - as it is banished to the depths of the Void - and Blakk reaps **an amount of innovation points proportional to the severity of the attack.**
	- This ability consumes **10 Innovation Charges**.
	- This ability additionally can only be used on projectiles.
- Defensive
**The Iron Wall** - Brch, Cado
*"Lubricant for when it should be moving, duct tape for otherwise."*
	Blakk takes up a solid stance, submerging her feet partially into the Void. So long as she is **not moving**, the Radial Blast Shield unfurls further and expands into a wall of amaranthine alloy, and is able to soak up physical blows based on how many innovation charges she has left. This ability can take everything from blades and bullets to explosions, and serves to fortify any position Blakk occupies.
	- This ability consumes a number of innovation charges per blow, based on the **severity of the strike**.

### Draw Strike
**Hazard Drawer** - Cado, Brch, Induc, Unrav
*"The mark of a good engineer is organization. The mark of a better engineer is not needing it."*
	When Blakk executes her **Innovation Routine** formshift, one of six phenomena occur, randomly chosen;
	- Three to five weave-seeking missiles emerge from the rift and hunt down the strongest discernable targets in the vicinity, exploding once sufficiently close-by. 
	- The vicinity is suffused with lattice-melting gas, doing considerable inductive damage to those who are touched by it.
	- A blinding flash and a disorienting sonic follow-up surge from the rift, stunning all targets.
	- An explosion of lacerating depthstone shrapnel that rips through friend and foe alike, defeating defenses and armor.
	- A shower of oil that suffuses the air and slicks the ground beneath, before violently igniting.
	- A burst of immensely powerful hyperweave that crackles indiscriminately through the air, sundering chalk and weave with destabilizing wrath.

### Formshift
**Innovation Routine**
*"I was never the best acolyte, but I did what I had to. It's paid off."*
  
Blakk's Formshift allows them to return contraptions in the Cache of the Contraptions after summoning them. When Blakk summons a contraption from their cache, they expend one 'charge' of '**Innovation**'. Blakk is able to summon the first contraption - that is, no other contraptions are active - for free. All of Blakk's contraptions are summoned as **possessions** by default. 

However, when Blakk formshifts a contraption in **possession state**, it expends an innovation charge and returns as a **gift from the void**, with a skew known as a **hack**. These hacks alter the **functionality of contraptions** in Blakk's active arsenal, and adds a charge to Blakk's **hack counter**. Additionally, triggering re-**Innovate** on a **hacked** contraption - that is innovating/formshifting a contraption **with an active hack/skew** - **refunds two Innovation charges**, which allows Blakk to summon more contraptions.

Thus, Blakk has three actions they can perform; **formshift/innovate**, **formshift/*re*-innovate**, and **summoning** - leading to the following rotation;
- Blakk begins with zero Innovation Charges (ICs), zero points on the Hack Counter (HC), zero possession/taken-state contraptions (PSCs) and zero hacked/gift-state contraptions (HSCs).
- Blakk **summons** their first PSC for free, the Strafe Boosters.
- Blakk then **innovates** the Strafe Boosters into their Blast **Hack** form, adding one point to the **hack counter** and granting one contraption in hacked state, and reducing their taken state contraption number to zero.
- Blakk then **re-innovates** the Blast Hack on the Strafe Boosters into the Featherlight Hack. This yields **two Innovation Charges**, while the HC and the HSC counts remain at one.
> This is due to the fact the Hack Counter merely counts the number of summoned contraptions that *currently have* **active hacks**, and isn't a stacking counter of *how many hacks Blakk has shifted and cycled through*.
- Blakk **summons** two more contraptions - the Assault Gauntlets and Repulsor Plate, **expending** her two ICs, gaining two PSCs and the HC and HSC counters remain at zero.
- Blakk then **innovates** all PSCs and **re-innovates** all HSCs. This yields **three** HSCs, raises the HC to **three points**, yields **two ICs** (from re-innovating the HSC) and reduces the number of PSCs to zero.
- Blakk **summons** their final contraption - the Breach Visor - depleting **two ICs**, raising the PSC count to **one**, and the HC and HSC count remain the same.
- Blakk **innovates** the one PSC and **re-innovates** all three HSCs. This reduces the number of PSCs to zero, and the number of HSCs to four. It additionally raises the HC to four. However, the Breach Visors have a unique effect when active, that **triples** all IC gain from using the Formshift. As such, **re-innovating** all three HSCs yields **six ICs** per HSC, resulting in **18 ICs** gained.
- **Re-innovating** all HSCs with the Breach Visor modifier active yields **24 ICs**, which added to the original 18 becomes **44 ICs**.

Blakk can also **expend two innovation charges** to formshift a contraption with a hack (a void gift) and return it to the Void, to then re-Take it as a contraption in base form with no hacks (a void possession). This depletes the count on the hack counter, expectedly.

>Additionally,
>- With upwards of **20 ICs** available, Blakk can summon the final contraption, the **Radial Blast Shield**. This raises the HC to 5.
>- Attacks with the Radial Blast Shield consume ICs but generate **virtual points** for the Hack Counter, allowing it to exceed the cap.
>- Virtual points added to the Hack Counter allows for further empowering the **Assault Gauntlets: Railgun Hack** and the **Rift Vibrokhopesh**'s **Utility: Momentum Conduit**. When expended on either attack, all virtual points are lost.
>- When Blakk feels enough virtual hack charge has been accumulated, she can perform her de-facto finisher, **Blakk's Breaker**. This ability shatters the Radial Blast Shield, requiring it to be summoned again. 

## T4 - The Deep Hollow
### Hollow Basilica
**Ill-Fitted Workshop** - Induc, Comp, Unrav, Prax 
*"We can all learn a thing or two from each other. Like workplace safety. But not from me."*

Blakk takes hold of local reality and plunges it into the depths, expanding a consecrated space encircled by an impassable boundary of prohibitive curvature; the Deep Hollow. Performed with a spread-palmed slap on the ground, all caught in its rapidly expanding range are transported into the excavated hollow, and compelled to engage by the rules of Blakk's Basilica.

Blakk's Basilica takes the shape of a metalworking workshop, a spherical space built of dull riveted alloy and piercingly bright lights. Machines of all disciplines - lathes, mills, presses and grinders - take hallowed positions on the cramped floorspace, workbenches littered with files, calipers and blowtorches. Lined against one wall are canisters of all manners of gases, valves at their necks and pipes disappearing into corners and crevices. Cabinets line the wall filled with aged metalwork. An oil slick mocks the mop propped next to it, a shrine to the evils of procrastination. Levers sprout from a central junction box, labeled worryingly with various descriptions of grievous bodily harm. At its center, a vaulted chair, cushioned, regally placed, mechanical arms snapping from its backrest, glowing wires spiraling out from its beneath, blinking monitors bathing it in blue halogen. It watches over the entire workshop, and the steel-bronze scrap-work sculpture of a Daughter leans over it, veil drooping as a willow, watches over the mechanic at its center.

Being a Basilica, both the Forbid and the Binding are active. The Binding of the Acolyte has written a facet of her *Draw Strike: Hazard Drawer* into the Cathedral Ledgers of her Basilica, and under circumstances, she can deploy a powerful **flux gas** throughout her Hollow as a **sultanic strike**, guaranteeing that it hits. 

This gas-based technique;
- Inflicts a **heavy inductive poison** that caustically rips through the lattice.
- Sunders the Five Straits with **computational damage** that inhibits the casting of complex abilities.
	- Those struck cannot use any ability above their T2s.
- Inflicts heavy **unravelling** on the target as well, further hampering the ability to use chalkweaving and other techniques.

Additionally, Blakk can summon her Basilica in two **different states**;
- **Ill-Fitted Workshop: Evacuation**: the base state of Blakk's Basilica. Upon being expanded, her flux gas technique immediately takes hold of the space and saturating the lattices of all of Blakk's targets in the Hollow. However, it must reach a certain level of saturation before the effects of the gas takes place. As such, Blakk must restrain targets in her Basilica for as long as possible so that her sultanic strike can activate.
	- Using a **vow**, Blakk can place an exit in her Hollow; a trapdoor in the roof of her workshop, that manipulates the spatial barrier at a point to allow exit. By providing a means to escape her technique however, the efficacy of the flux gas is multiplied **1.5 times**.

- **Ill-Fitted Workshop: Supplication**: a modification of the base form of the Hollow, that makes use of a binding vow had with the Amaranth Sultan. When the Hollow is expanded in the Supplication state, each party in the Hollow is informed that they must perform a **random feat of workshop activity**. This can be anything from filing down a knife to assembling a jumpship; the Amaranth Sultan decides. Based on who **completes their feat first**, the Hollow resolves in one of two ways.
	- Should Blakk succeed, the flux gas in the Hollow space will strike immediately, and with a potency of **2.5 times** base. Additionally, it gains a **praxis component**, and inflicts an inductive weaken to the struck target **and their allies** if they are not aligned with the Void.
	- Should Blakk's *allies* succeed, the flux gas strikes, but with only a **2x** multiplier above base.
	- Should an opponent succeed, the Hollow immediately collapses, and Blakk suffers the spatial backlash by being **unable to summon anything from the Void**. This locks her out of her *Formshift: Innovation Routine* ability temporarily.

In addition to the above, Blakk's Hollow being a workshop comes with a suite of aptly themed **environmental hazards**, more specifically manifesting as supersized power tools;
- **Burners**: welding torch flames, belt sanders.
- **Blades**: angle grinders, circular saws, band saws, drills.
- **Bludgeoners**: power hammers.

In addition to being able to deploy these various tools as attacks throughout her entire Hollow, she has an unlimited supply of hand tools to throw as projectiles and strike with in close range.

## T5 - The Crescent Hollow
### Crescent Basilica
**Calamitous Workshop** - Cado, Brch, Induc, Unrav
Axle: Draw Strike | Hazard Drawer
*"I have never believed in ascribing any amount of divinity to machines. I think there's something greater than that, and it lies in us, the creators."*

The Rogue Riftlock Blakk served in the courts of the Sultan's Daughters as an artisan, and worked towards realizing the endless downpour from the sky into workable technologies for the sultanates below. But time and circumstance forced them to flee, and though separated from the hallowed post she once held, losing such conveniences - enduring such strife - has only served to hone their convictions in themselves, their works, and the codices of Vahn. It has thus enabled her to take her post - her workshop - with her, in the form of her Deep Hollow.

Taking hold of this space, however, and inverting it upon the fourth spatial axis yields a sky-scouring alloy cogwheel in space, cut and shaped into a moon-mocking crescent. This inversion of her workshop exerts her will across space itself, and allows her to paint the very air with the machinations belched from her **Hazard Drawer**. By utilizing a **vow** that applies the Forbid of the Faithful to only **inanimate objects** rather than living subjects, Blakk siphons chalk from local space into her workshop, and summarily it is woven by the hands of the Sultan into **stockpiles of ordnance**. 

**Every possible phenomena** that results from Blakk using her **Hazard Drawer** Draw Strike is encased in a warhead and loaded into the hardpoint firing bays of her Crescent Hollow, and upon explosion, the loaded phenomena will resolve as is typical. Once suitable mass of ordnance is achieved, Blakk is able to trigger the resolution of the technique, resulting in a **saturation bombardment** of vast swathes of space with missiles. Empowered by the ledgers governing the space, these missiles - and the phenomena loaded in them - are massively empowered to **multiple times their regular potency**. 

This technique must be **actively channeled** for Blakk to perform, and considerable disruption can end the channeled cast prematurely. However, should Blakk wish, and should calcic material be available, Blakk is able to siphon chalk, weave missiles via her crescent workshop, and fire them **indefinitely**.
