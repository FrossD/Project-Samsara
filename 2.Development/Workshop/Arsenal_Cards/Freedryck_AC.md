# Arsenal Card: Freedryck, Favored of Frost
A nomad by creed, he has traveled to the farthest reaches of the known Switchboard and gone even beyond the first paths penned by Shalkarah, King of Roads. Ancient writ passed through the backbone lineage of the Danseer that was melted in the Triptych Crucible, and the Silk-strider that was poured into andromorphic molds, has conferred upon him an affinity for the frozen worlds of the Dancirah, and the sleeping intelligences that are birthed under snowy pine and stately glacier. Light steps on lighter wings have danced across the tundra, and the rhythmic turns and dips are accompanied by aged canticle. With a finger snap, ice is brought to bear, and with the downward swing of a hammerpick, fissures split ice caps. Wielding the power of **ice conjuration** and command over **weft transmutation**, Freedryck the Favored descends upon battlegrounds as a frozen comet, heralding the coming of an Age of Still.

## T2 - Elementary Calcic
### Weave Strike
**Shiver Strike** - Brch
Axle: Tek | Freeze and Clear
"*It's really hard on the wrist.*"
	To mitigate the damage of what's to come, Freedryck encases his fist in **packed ice**, and above it, a layer of **blast ice**. With a strike, the blast ice explodes into a target, doing considerable damage.

### Weave Charge
**Cryonic Shrapnel** - Grenade - Cado, Brch, Induc
Axle: Tek | Freeze and Clear
"*A powerful statement to begin any deliberation.*"
	By encasing a sphere of **blast ice** in a shroud of **packed ice**, Freedryck concocts an elementary but powerful fragmentation grenade. Additional writ upon the charge can give it conditions for when to detonate, such as impact, time and proximity, and additionally, Freedryck can weave **transmutation** instructions into the layer of packed ice that becomes shrapnel, such as turning it into further blast ice to inflict more damage over a wider area.

### Weave Shield
**Frost Armor** - Passive - Cado, Brch, Induc
Axle: Tek | Freeze and Clear
"*Seek shelter from the storm.*"
	Inflicting **sap ice** upon his own lattice gradually covers Freedryck in ice, which he can then **transmute** into **packed ice** to form a dense, protective layer over his person. This layer of thick ice is solid insulation against all forms of traditional incident damage, and can be rapidly dismissed by **transmuting** once again into **mist ice**.

### Weave Dash
**Floe State**
Axle: Tek | Freeze and Clear
"*Our birthright is the sky, yes, but we must never forget how to move on the ground below.*"
	Freedryck clicks his heels, and begins outputting **drift ice** beneath his feet. This ice is incredibly difficult to move on for those untrained and unused to it, and additionally accelerates the velocities of anything upon it. By deploying sheets of slip ice in front of him as he moves, Freedryck is able to accelerate to considerable speeds, as well as transform the battlefield to one only he can move effectively on.

### Weave Armament
**Yintu Yintu** - Equation - Warhammer, Dagger
Axle: Tek | Freeze and Clear
"*I fashioned it in the shape of the vitric weapon once used - I believe - by Skydancer Ryjik. I wanted it to espouse an element similar to his; the power to break.*"
	Carved from the husk of a blizzard-kissed oak, the blackened wooden handle has hardened to steely integrity, and the wrappings of aged leather along its length shields the wielder from the permanent rimefrost coating it. Terminating at the end of a subtle curve are the twin heads of scintillating Azurfrost blue; one defined by the long nose of an old snow witch, the other the calloused forehead of a weathered tundra-born. The ends glow and whistle and in harmony with raging storms on a thousand white marbles, hung from loose strings in the Dancirah, and with every swing, the air freezes and cracks in its wake, a promise of destruction whispered by canticle.

**Yintu Yintu** is a woven armament formed via the writ of Freedryck's tek, *Freeze and Clear*, taking the shape of a hammerpick. The blunt end of the tool-weapon is shod permanently in **blast ice**, adding explosive force behind every strike, and the sharp pick end of the armament is formed from **packed ice**, its nigh indestructible nature allowing it to pierce and shatter the strongest defenses. At the end of the armament, serving as the pommel, is an amount of **mist ice**, that can be released with pommel strikes against targets. 

- Offensive
**Freedryck's Vortex** - Cado, Brch
Axle: Tek | Freeze and Clear
"*The safest place in the storm is at the center of it.*"
	Freedryck coats his hand in **drift ice** and begins spinning Yintu Yintu in his palm, rapidly accelerating it to hurricane speeds. When ready, Freedryck can slam down with the hammerpick with either end, inflicting either devastating caedometric damage to pierce targets, or causing a catastrophic explosion. 

- Defensive
**Mist's Epicenter**
Axle: Tek | Freeze and Clear
"*Move under the cover of favored frost.*"
	Striking the pommel of Yintu Yintu causes it to begin emanating copious amounts of **mist ice**. In Freedryck's hand, it forms a dense cloud of ice that various observation mechanisms cannot penetrate, including weavesight. 

- Utility
**Resonance**
Axle: Tek | Freeze and Clear
"*The 'clear' part in 'freeze and clear'.*"
	Yintu Yintu is able to **compound** the effects of struck ice depending on whether the incident and struck ends are the same state.
	- Should the blunt **blast ice** end of Yintu Yintu strike existing blast ice, the resultant explosive force is **squared.**
	- Should the sharp **packed ice** end of Yintu Yintu strike existing packed ice, the ice and whatever lattice it encases are **shattered**, inflicting internal lattice damage that greatly disrupts their integrity.

- Feat
**Maelstrom** - Cado, Brch, Induc
Axle: Tek | Freeze and Clear
"*You never see it coming.*"
	Freedryck winds back and throws Yintu Yintu. As it flies, it releases a dense cloud of obscuring **mist ice** that prevents accurately determining its travel -and thus approach - trajectory. Once it has travelled far enough, the mist ice immediately **transmutes** into **blast ice**, and Yintu Yintu becomes an approaching cascade of explosions. On impact, it always strikes with the **packed ice** sharp end, embedding itself into the target and constantly suffusing dense clouds of mist ice which immediately become blast ice, resulting in the target being bombarded with endless point-blank explosions. Being a weapon formed from an equation, Freedryck can weave and throw as many as he likes, though each previous iteration becomes more and more unstable the longer it has been out of his immediate vicinity, eventually collapsing into weave.

## T3 - Advanced Calcic
### Tek
**Freeze and Clear**
"*Ice freezes yes, but it also blocks, shatters, cuts and shapes.*"

Freedryck, Favored by Frost, is conferred with a tek that grants the power of evoking ice and cold. A permanent coating of rime shrouds his limbs and phalanges, and on mere reflex he can weave immense quantities of chalk into piercing, lacerating, crushing frost to subjugate opponents.

The true power of this tek emerges from its versatility, as Freedryck is able to concoct nearly any solid object imaginable out of ice. Blades, bulwarks, projectiles, armor, colossal walls, slippery floors, fields of frozen spikes, choking clouds of frost, even entities bearing elementary intelligence to do his bidding. Coupled with a tek constrained only by the wielder's creativity, is his ability to **alter** the crystalline structure and the writ of his ice, making it stronger, weaker, more susceptible or resistant to certain types of incident damage, and in particular, deploying ice of varying **states** that he can then trigger selective effects against.

The true power of *Freeze and Clear* lies in the ability to design and conjure **alternate forms** of base ice, each with additional properties, and in turn, able to be selectively targeted by weft and ritualism, to yield a variety of effects. Freedryck is able to summon forth **five** forms of ice to use in a variety of techniques.

- **Drift Ice**; extremely slippery and difficult to move on, and gradually accelerates anything that interacts with it under gravity (such as standing on it).
	- This ice is useful for **zone control**, via disrupting enemy movements, as well as **enhanced mobility** as Freedryck is able to move over this ice quickly and gracefully.
  
- **Blast Ice**; ice that is extremely unstable, and upon given a trigger, explodes with immense kinetic force. 
	- This ice is valuable for its raw **destructive power**, as well as **imparting momentum** on other forms of ice in play.
	- Possesses intrinsic **Breach** damage.

- **Packed Ice**; this ice is incredibly difficult to fracture, chip or break, and thus holds the first shape given to it immensely well.
	- This ice is particularly useful for **encasing** targets, as well as forming solid implements such as **blades** and **armor**.
	- Possesses intrinsic **Caedometric** and **Breach** damage dependent on application.

- **Sap Ice**; ice that possesses an inductive component, as it travels throughout a lattice, feeding on its weave to create more of itself.
	- This ice utilizes more subtle aspects of chalkweaving **sapping** the calcic reserves of opponents into ice that Freedryck can harvest, as well as **slowing** and **subjugating** them by disrupting the function of their lattice with encroaching cold.
	- Possesses intrinsic **Siphon** and **Inductive** damage.

- **Mist Ice**; ice that upon a trigger, explodes violently into a cloud of freezing, obscuring mist.
	- This ice serves a variety of tactical purposes, being able to **distribute** ice over a large area, **transmit ice within** a target structure, as well as **obscure** the view of any trapped within it.

In addition to summoning forth forms of ice, under certain conditions he is able to **transit the forms** of one ice to another, allowing him to execute incredibly advanced, multi-step techniques that can greatly surprise and confuse an opponent, and provide powerful boons to Freedryck himself.

- Offensive
**Coldsnap** - Cado, Brch, Siph, Induc
Axle: Tek | Freeze and Clear
"*Point, and click.*"
	By performing the somatic component of snapping fingers while whipping the hand in a direction, Freedryck instantly fires a fast-moving projectile made of tightly-packed ice **of his choice**. This projectile travels considerably quickly, and on impact or at will, explodes into a shock of jagged ice. In addition to this, Freedryck with another hand movement can **deflect** the explosion of ice material in a direction of choosing, and adding this directional component has effects on what he chooses to do with this ice. This technique serves the primary purpose of **getting ice on the battlefield** for Freedryck to manipulate.
	- Depending on the ice used, this attack does various damage types to struck targets.

- Defensive
**(N/A)**
*"My methods do not entirely oppose defense, but they have made extensive investment into it unnecessary."*

- Utility
**Coldsnap: Transmutation**
Axle: Tek | Freeze and Clear
"*This is the true power of my frozen weftcraft.*"
	Augmenting the regular *Coldsnap*, Freedryck can fire out a bolt of ice that is in turn outfitted with inductive weft. Upon impact with existing ice, that ice is **transmuted** into the form of the ice that struck it. This technique 

- Burst
**Full Cryonics Alchemist**
Axle: Flashcharge, Tek | Freeze and Clear
"*This is the true power of my frozen weftcraft.*"
	By expending **flashcharge**, Freedryck is able to **transmute** his various states of ice from one form to another, the amount of flashcharge expended scaling with the volume of ice transmuted. In addition to this, the cost of transmuting between ice states has an additional **multiplier** based on the initial and final state of the transmutation. In general;
	- Mist Ice
	- Drift Ice
	- Sap Ice
	- Packed Ice
	- Blast Ice
	The more 'distant' one form of ice is from the other, the more flashcharge is needed to transmute it. In addition to that, an additional cost is placed when transmuting to ice further down the list, as this ice is more complex in make.
	- Wherever **transmutation** is mentioned, this technique is being invoked. 

### Quis
Immense reliance on his tek has somewhat left Freedryck disinclined to other forms of chalkweaving not dependent on it. For this reason, he has done little by way of delving into the calcic ritualism, beyond ways of reaping additional benefit from his ice techniques.

- **Ice Tap**
Axle: Tek | Freeze and Clear
"*Dividends for hard work."*
	Freedryck summons forth a glacial qui-wheel, filling it with components and a measure of his signature ice, and uttering the verbal component of the ritual's name. Upon touching any **sap ice** in the environment, it and all sap ice nearby are immediately unwound into pure chalk to replenish Freedryck's own calcic reserves.

## T4 - Grand Calcic
### Rituals
**Tundra Call: Frost Acolyte** - Cast - Cado, Brch, Induc
"*To be favored requires something to favor you, after all.*"
	Freedryck erects a site of ritual geometry, expending components and chalk and a considerable amount of his own ice, and conjures forth of a living manifestation of his favor, taking the form of a golem-like construct built of ice. More sturdy than a cliffside and wielding twin packed ice and blast ice weapons similar to *Yintu Yintu*, these constructs are able to do considerable amounts of damage, as well as shield Freedryck from attack. All damage done to them manifests as a loss of ice material from their lattices, and thus they can be repaired by adding more ice, such as through *Coldsnap*. Their elementary straits discern targets via their temperature, and thus target the warmest instance of thinking weave in the environment, enabling autonomous function, but also susceptibility to perceptive opponents.

### Extended Disciplines
**Coldsnap: Stormcell** - Ledgerial Technique - Cado, Brch, Siph, Induc
Axle: Tek | Freeze and Clear
*"There is no hiding from the ash-blizzards of the black tundra."*
	Utilizing truly advanced chalkweaving, Freedryck expands a bounded space and imposes a ledger upon it, the writ of this ledger being eliminating an activation criteria for his *Coldsnap* technique. All targets within the boundary - upon completing the somatic finger snap necessary to activate the technique - are immediately struck by *Coldsnap*, bypassing the traditional functionality of needing to be struck by the projectile first. 
	- This technique additionally does double duty, in that it additionally allows for bypassing the same criteria for *Coldsnap: Transmutation* as well, allowing Freedryck to **transmute any ice** within this boundary as well. 


## T5 - Flash Protocol
**Name** - Subclass (Lattice, Weave | Burst, Burn) - Damage Type
Axle:
"*Flavor Text.*"
	Description

**Freedryck's Comet** - Weave Burst - Brch
Axle: Tek | Freeze and Clear
*"The earliest Dancirah was a domain of unimaginable chaos, dominated by a doctrine of motion. The First Thinkers spread on the backs of comets, formed from the shattering of planets. These were the original striders."*
	Freedryck sets his dedicom strait ablaze, and fires *Coldsnap* far into the lower reaches of a planet's atmosphere, detonating it to form an ultra-dense core. Repeatedly chaining massively empowered casts of *Coldsnap* rapidly builds the mass of this falling projectile, with the only real limit being how much flashcharge Freedryck has and is ready to expend, and how quickly he can fire off blasts of *Coldsnap*. Directing the blasts of *Coldsnap* upon striking the forming projectile serves to guide its trajectory towards the desired impact zone. It falls as a comet, and on impact, explodes with catastrophic force, demolishing a wide area with the sheer kinetic force of the blast. Typically in the blend is a mixed core of **blast ice** and **packed ice**, with layers of **packed ice** and **mist ice** shrouding that core. Mist ice in the blend allows for covering a wide area in the aftermath with ice that Freedryck can transmute as he sees fit.

**Age of Still** - Weave Burst - Induc, Brch
Axle: Tek | Freeze and Clear, Extended Disciplines
*"A question was posed once on whether one can fight the endless record-keeping of the stars, and the eternal flow of the Current. I might have glimpsed a means to do it."*
	An immensely complicated technique, Freedryck expands a boundary, imposes a ledger upon it as with *Coldsnap: Stormcell* and utilizes a praxis vow on his own technique to impose a state of **final transmutation**, in which any ice he creates while under the effect of the vow **cannot** be transmuted, irrespective of method or condition. As this expends the flashcharge, upon activation of the technique via finger snap, an immensely vast area is immediately struck and encased in a blend of **packed** and **sap ice**. This lethal blend traps targets in inescapable ice, as well as gradually saps their constituent weft to form more ice, which in turn devours them more rapidly. Left unattended, the affected area will be gradually transmuted into Freedryck's ice; nothing living remains, beginning a localized Age of Still.
