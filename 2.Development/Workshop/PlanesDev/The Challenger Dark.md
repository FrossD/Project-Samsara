# Isalveh, The Challenger Dark
The Void lurks just out of sight, occupying the space beneath the Switchboard. It is a realm of mystery, power and treachery - from the violet expanse of the Amaranth Sea to the peaks of the peaks of the wrathful Onina. 

Dwelling in the Dark below are the Vahnkin, descendants of Brother Vahn who have made this realm their home. They dwell under the watchful eyes of the Sultanates, sail the high Amaranth Seas and plunder the lost isles for their artifacts from the Sky above. They came to call this realm 'Isalveh', their home below. 

## Preamble
The Void has drawn many names to it - much like it draws information - all created by Strider Researchers seeking to encapsulate as much meaning into as few words as possible, attempting to hold the sheer vastness and depth of the Void in - effectively - a bottle. The Vahnian Realm. The Sea of Quanta. The Dark Below. The Void-sea. The Inverted Sky. A consensus was eventually reached, and the traversable depths of the Void were dubbed, '**The Challenger Dark**'.

The Void is best imagined as a sea; vast, deep, unknowable fully, immensely treacherous. It tests the resourcefulness of the prepared, the hardiness of the strong, the creativity of the intelligent, and the will of the brave. Fully grasping what awaits is a challenge. Mighty storms and towering waves await travelers across the expansive sea, reducing vessels to scrap and splinter. The lands - few and far between - feature nigh impassable terrain in the form of marsh and mountain, dense forests and scorching desert, all altered and tainted by the endlessly pouring information from the Switchboard above, making all things unpredictable and dangerous. ^bcdd1b

The extreme environment forges all that moves, breathes and lives in the Switchboard into mobile terrors, shaping them into states closer to the perfection of their nature. Claws rip cleaner, teeth tear sharper, roars scares deeper. Those who have made the Dark their home are frequently unwilling to share that territory, and have been granted power by the Deep.

The constant pour of information makes braving these challenges worthwhile however, as all things missing from the Switchboard can almost surely be found in the endless Dark. Information in the Dark takes on new forms, manifesting as more solid. Secrets become temples, landmarks and constructs on maps, reachable only by the tenacious, their power awaiting any who find them. Power awaits all those who are ready, and know how, to look.

## Geography
The nature of the Challenger Dark is a result of its unique geography, driven by its placement relative to the rest of the Switchboard. Unique phenomena serve to shape its unique qualities, as elaborated upon below.

### The Stardrip
The curvature of the induces 'drains' in the Switchboard above, through which information pours through to the Void below. Armillary stars, dense in information, induce the most curvature, causing them to 'sink' partially into the Challenger Dark, resembling hemispheres of light tacked to seemingly a flat surface that serves as the sky of the Challenger Dark - often called the 'deep sky'. The natural curvature of the Void also induces more chalk from elsewhere than the armillary stars to fall to the depths. Upon crossing the **Challenger Horizon**, the chalk pools in the deep sky, grows heavy and falls to the surface of the Dark below. This is the **stardrip**, and it is responsible for the oddities within the Challenger Dark.

> The Challenger Horizon is the boundary between the Sky and the Void, created on-the-spot as it was necessary.

The stardrip is a chaotic cocktail of volatile chalk that seeps into the Void, like wastewater from the Sky above pouring down the drain, saturated with all manners of dissolved information from all corners of the Sky, compelled to mix with each other without rhyme or pattern. This aberrant mix of chalk taints the landscape of the Void with pure chaos, morphing it - typically - into more 'monstrous' versions of its original state; flora grow wild, large, and wicked, evolving elementary intelligences dwarfed by their predatory hungers. Fauna grow similarly large and evolve a penchant for violence, deepening such if it were already present. The landscape itself becomes similarly perverted; opting for treachery and impassability where possible - acrid, corrosive swamps, titanic mountain ranges, vast expanses of empty desert.

> The stardrip falls as violet-kaleidoscopic rain, and is majorly responsible for purple, magenta and its sister anc cousin colors serving as the Void's characteristic hue.

### The Amaranthine Sea
The most defining geological characteristic of the Challenger Dark, however, earning it much of its names and repute, and the anchor around which most of its mythos revolves is the Amaranthine Sea, an expanse of stardrip that spans a considerable amount of the surface area of the Dark.

The Amaranth earns its name from its distinct hue; a glittery purple shade with kaleidoscopic crushed glass suspended within it.

What the Amaranth is also known for is its extreme treachery. Great storms wrack the Amaranth, high waves sweep across its surface, and the stardrip itself belches discharges of flux. It's seabed is unstable with tectonic activity, causing super-sized waves and releasing trapped gaseous hazards from deep within the Dark's core. 

	The greatest hazards of the Amaranth, however, are far more alive and far more 'intelligent', as expanded upon later.

### The Stardrip Cycle
A phenomena within the Challenger Dark by which stardrip is purified back into raw chalk and returned to the Switchboard, forming a recycling loop that maintains a semblance of balance.

The Dark's plate tectonics are such that fairly regularly, colossal rifts open in the seafloor, and immense volumes of stardrip seep through, flowing down cracks and crevices to reach the center 'core' of the Dark. There - by actions not fully understood - they are recycled back into pure chalk, and sent back to the surface of the Dark through channels, emerging at the surface through volcano-like structures that belch chalk straight through the horizon, back into the Switchboard.

The other half of this cycle is of course, describe above; chalk in the Switchboard seeping through the various drains back into the Dark, where they refill the Amaranth.

> The Stardrip Cycle is directly responsible for high and low tides.

> Naming: these volcano-analogues need a name. Under Y-naming, they are called 'onina', and taking that further, onina will take suffix names to differentiate them from other onina, such as 'Onina Vahn'. 

> Also needing naming is the actual eruption of chalk from an onina, which - as we understand chalk in the Switchboard - is no small phenomena. Chalk erupting randomly in the Switchboard is definitely a cause for concern to Striders. We can possibly use Y-naming here again.

> The rifts in the seafloor opening up as well is also an event worthy of a name, as it's definitely a significant occurrence to all those who ply the Amaranth.

A consequence of this is that a means exist for a trapped Strider to escape the Void; by speculating when onina will erupt, and jumping into the stream, a Strider can ride the current back into the Switchboard. There is of course the risk of overwrite, as well as the eruption not being sufficient propulsion, resulting in a Strider now many kilometers in the air.  

### Upon the Amaranth
The vast majority of the landmass in the Challenger Dark consist of islands of varying sizes, archipelagos and then considerably large 'mega-islands' that straddle the space between an island and a country.

The effects of the stardrip induces unconventional geography to these islands, resulting in landmasses that play host to biomes with no business being proximally close to one another; tundra next to desert, swamp bordering mountain, rainforest that shares border with mudflats. Typically, islands do have fairly consistent elevation, with areas closest to the center of an island having the highest elevation in the form of sprawling mountain range, and the land closest to the coast being fairly level with it.

The Dark's errant tectonics means that islands are fairly in flux however. Mountain ranges can grow in height, or crumble as plates crash violently against each other. Stardrip drains can open up right under and island, splitting it in two. Plates moving apart may also split large islands into collections of small ones, forming archipelagos. 

The classification of islands upon the Amaranth is done through which faction stakes claim to it. Most of the Dark's people - the vahnkin - dwell in the **Sultanate Isles**; islands or collections of them under rule by a wearer of the **'Iyunvahde'**; the **coral crown of the depths**. In addition to them are the **Lost Isles**, land that remains unclaimed by the Sultanate, or is controlled by powers that oppose or reject the authority and sovereignty of the Sultanate. 

## The Sultanate
The Sultanate Isles and the vahnkin are ruled over by wearers of the Iyunvahde; the Amaranth Sultans. The Sultanate refers to both the territories ruled over by the Sultan, as well as their cabinet of servants. Sultans are typically part of a dynasty, tracing their lineage back to the first progeny of Vahn himself.

	A Sultan possesses a Sultanate, and this term is used generally inspite of the actual gender of the Sultan. Where specificity is required, 'Shaltanahat' and 'Saltahva' are used for users of Shaltanah and Saltah respectively. 

### Ships Upon the Amaranth
A natural consequence of the Amaranth Sea and island nations in the Challenger Dark is the proliferation of seafaring and naval endeavors, in the forms of various major and minor naval factions and classes of ships. Naval conglomerates fall under two main umbrellas; Sultanate fleets armed, funded and managed by individual Iyunvahde, and privateer fleets run - almost always - by pirates.

#### Ship Classes
Ship classes in the Challenger Dark derive their major distinctions from existing ones in real life, arranged across spectra of size, speed, weaponry and armor and modified accordingly based on purpose. Each ship class - as a NarratWB point - is named after the first and direct progeny of Vahn.

	These will be reflected later once the genealogy of Vahn is fully developed.

In no specific order;
1. **Battleships**
	Heavily armed and armored warships capable of all manners of engagements, - particularly those at range - made possible by their vast array of weaponry and offensive systems. Engagements between fleets is often decided by the might of each power's battleships.

2. **Destroyers**
	Fast and highly maneuverable ships, serving as escort ships to deter medium and short range attackers. To borrow a non-naval term, they serve the purpose of 'ship CQC'.

3. **Cruiser**
	Ships designed for multipurpose, often non-combat operations defined by distance and equipment specialization, bearing considerably lightened armament and armor. From what I've read, however, they seem to be a largely obsolete ship class.

4. **Corvettes**
	The smallest and fastest ship class, designed for missile deployment and fast attack. Highly functional ships with vast function. 

5. **Battlecruisers**
	Straddling the lines between battleship and cruiser, the battlecruiser skimps on armor in exchange for speed while maintaining or upgrading armament and acquiring specialized equipment to enhance its capabilities. These modifications make them the powers of any force, able to spar with ships well above their own eight.

6. **Frigates**
	Speed and maneuverability for escort and patrol. Very lightly armed and armored, playing utility and non-combat support roles when needed. Notably larger than Corvettes.

7. **Cathedrals**
	A ship class necessary to exist within universe, designed as a cousin to the battleship, but instead armed with calcic and curvature weaponry, as well as means to perform downsized structural casts and regular rituals for usage in combat. These ships typically double as semi-religious structures in devotion to Brother Vahn.

8. **Scepter**
	Scepter-class ships are the seats of an Iyunvahde heading into battle, and serve to represent and project their power across vast distances. Their weaponry is typically the Iyunvahde themselves if they are seated within it, able to use the entire ship as a means to utilize their powers.

#### Sultanate Fleets
A formation of ships under the command of a Sultan, though actively led on the field by an admiral. Fleets are divided into squadrons which have squadron commanders, and individual ships which have their own vessel captains.

	Use Y-naming and the Vahnkin nomenclature doctrine to develop new names for admiral, squadron commander and captains.

Command of these fleets - as often the Iyunvahde possesses multiple - is done by the (coral crown) of the Sultan. Fleet admirals report directly to them, and they in turn are ever by the side of the Iyunvahde.

Conflict between Iyunvahde is handled majorly through ship combat to defeat enemy assets such as ships, and capture strategically advantageous islands. Fleets also frequently engage pirate fleets and vessels, which often seek to capture individual sultanate isles for themselves, or plunder merchant ships.

#### Pirates
Privateers, scorned nobles, hardy chalkstriders, all manners of individuals take to the Amaranth in search of spoil or repute, often doing so at the expense of the Sultanate and other similar individuals.

Bands of pirates exist, flying flags and led by charismatic - or fear-inspiring - leaders or collectives of individuals united by cause or origin. Crews are assembled from mercenaries, willing miscreants, family, followers of creed etc. with ships acquired from either private shipbuilders or stolen and refitted from sultan fleets or other private companies.

Operation of the ship and division of spoils is fairly democratic and egalitarian, with pirate quartermasters serving as checks to a captain's power, able to veto them if necessary.

Various bands of pirates exist, the most prolific being the **Ametyst Scorn**. The lore on them is inconclusive, but they trace their origin from a forsaken descendant of Vahn seeking revenge upon their siblings.

## The Wandering Isle of Vahngrahv
An isle that, most perplexingly, moves. On it rests a cathedral where Brother Vahn was finally lain to rest. Those who find the isle are able to commune with Vahn, gleaning wisdom, gifts from the depths, and the power of the [[The Void#The Drift Protocol |Drift]], granting additional powers and title of 'Void Drifter'. Beginning the pilgrimage to these isles is done with initiating the **Drift Protocol**, which immediately descends the caster into the Void, brands them with the mark of a pilgrim, and disallows them from leaving the Void by any means.
