# Cryogen's Proposal: Calcic Chemistry
**Rough 0 - Structure**
- Insert Macroscopics and Materials section under 'Calcic Physics' before **Latent Chalk** in HandsChalk.
- Insert Weavesight (Sight 2.0) after **Weave Mechanics** in HandsChalk.

**Rough 1 - Post Discussion**
- I came up with an idea for heat that works with weave, in which 'hot' is a woven property that for reasons, can move from pattern to pattern. Like the presence of the 'hot' weave induces 'hot' weave in other things, at the expense of itself.
- Refer to old Information Tangibility canon.

**Rough 2 - Macroscopic Material Properties + Weave**
- **Expansion on Pattern and Ribbon Duality**; the atom is dead. All things ('matter') in the Switchboard are made of weave from ribbon chalk. The 'matter' form of all things are their 'woven' or 'pattern' state, and unweaving them returns them to their ribbon state. Switchboard interactions happen at the ribbon level, similar to how chemistry interactions occur at the atomic level.
- **Macroscopic Material Properties**; all properties of all things in the Switchboard are a product of their weaving. Just as atoms are responsible for properties normally - hardness, softness, elasticity, shininess etc. - in the Switchboard, weave is what determines the properties of all things. 
- **Weave Engineering(?)**; it follows then that it is possible to engineer the creation of new patterns (read things), purely from weaving. Weaving certain properties together can allow for the creation of new materials for example, or the modification of existing ones. You could remove the hardness-bestowing weave from iron for example and get... soft iron? Is this the Switchboard's crafting system.
- **Engineering Constraints**; this form of ribbon-level weave alteration is possibly primarily through utility rituals, which allow for 'crafting' and 'modification' of weave. While the Weave Protocol can be used for simple weaving operations such as transiting between pattern and weave, more complex operations require employment of the chalk ritualism. 
- **Weave Deconstruction**; a sort of material cost to the practice. Pattern can be deconstructed or recycled back into constituent ribbon, and skilled chalkweavers can extract property-weaves and utilize them for weave engineering elsewhere. property-weaves might have some usefulness for casting as well, such as expending hardness weave to cast defensive abilities.
- **Property Weave Fabrication**; the sheer usefulness of property weave makes it narratively ideal if property weave can't just be spun from virtually nothing. Instead, property weave prefers to arise in those things that bear that property, who in turn arise spontaneously through natural processes that mirror our own, but put into motion instead by the calcic machinations that is the Switchboard's logic. While you could spin a hardness weave from chalk, it is much easier to simply harvest it from iron.
- **Property Weave Quantity**; iron is hard, but so is wood, and so is rock. What determines which is harder? Property weave is present in each, but in varying amounts, which is what creates the differentials. Extraction of property weave from each thus yields differing quantities of property weave.
- **Weave Transformation**; natural processes such as burning, freezing, etc. work by transitioning weave from one form to another. While it is possible for a weaver to replicate these processes, it is far easier to simply employ the processes as well due to the complexity of unweaving and reweaving something into a different shape.

**Rough 3 - Inductive Weave**
- Some weave induces itself in patterns around it, at the expense of its presence in another thing.
- Heat is weave that moves from pattern to pattern, inducing itself in target patterns, though inefficiently.
- Can electricity behave the same way? Can we have a whole category of 'flowing' or inductive property weave like this?

**Rough 4 - Sight 2.0**
>Re-engineer this as a calcic ability used by Striders and Weavers to see in the calcic universe more deeply.
- Seeing in the Switchboard is done using a form of calcic sight that functions through casting 'rays' of chalk at the environment, and observing the shapes formed by chalk rays being stopped by interfering weave.
- Typically, those without calcic powers are fed only the shape of the objects these chalk rays of perception strike.
- Possessors of the Weave Protocol however, gain access to a heightened form of sight known as the **Weavesight**. This advanced form of sight has two primary differences; calcic rays can be cast from anywhere on the body, and the actual rays penetrate deep into what they strike, allowing reaping more information, particularly that of the nature of the folded weave in patterned objects.
- This weavesight provides possessors passive information streams on the calcic world around them.

## Calcic Chemistry
### Transforming Weave
What happens when food is cooked in the Switchboard? In our world, application of heat compels the molecules of food to undergo chemical changes. Meat sees its proteins morph. Powdery flour is mixed into water to become a soft solid, then the yeast in it causes gas to form, and finally the heat applied turns this soft solid into a webbed, mesh-like structure. Vegetables boiled in water shrink and become soft. And in all these cases, something previously dubious to eat now becomes inarguably fine to do so.

What is the case in the Switchboard?

In the Switchboard, weave interacts in weave in manners similar to combining. In a section that will follow, heat is elaborated upon as a weave that is capable of inducing itself in patterns at the expense of its presence in a previous pattern, and by weaving itself into patterns, alters the overall properties of that pattern. Food in the Switchboard thusly takes in 'heat weave' which transforms its pattern into cooked forms.

### Elementary Calcic Physics: Inductive Weave
	Need the good doctor to comment on this.

There exists a phenomena inherent to some kinds of naturally occurring weave in which the weave is able to move from pattern to pattern by 'inducing' itself in a subject pattern while expending itself from where it originated from. More simply put, heat and other phenomena in the Switchboard are weave that can spontaneously or otherwise move from pattern A to pattern B, in a manner that the amount of weave present in A reduces, and the amount in B increases. The efficiency with which heat-weave moves between subject patterns, as well as the ability of something that is heated to store that heat, are controlled by property weaves that bear real-world names of thermal conductivity and thermal capacity.

>In which we then ask ourselves how far we can take the inductive weave. For one, we must establish an origin for inductive weave. For heat, it can be the armillary stars, Wellsprings and planets themselves if their planetary equations are written such that they produce heat.
>
>What is of particular concern however, is what else can be inductive weave. Suppose we replaced the phenomena of electricity with one of simply 'charge' or the state of *being* charged, and this charge-weave is something that flows through subject patterns and is stored within them, with these behaviors of flowing and storage controlled by property weaves of electroconductivity and another for 'propensity to hold charge' - borrowing a real world term here of 'capacitance'.

>Can this be applied to light as well? Is light weave? Does it bestow the property of 'illuminated' when it strikes a subject pattern? Is its reflective, refractive and other properties also a product of weave? It remains to be seen how far inductive weave can be taken as a concept.
