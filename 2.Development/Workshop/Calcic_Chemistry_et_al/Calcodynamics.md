# Calcodynamics: Calcimistry & Calcic Physics
Some hard rules (almost) on working chalk at the ribbon level.

## Calcimistry
The nature of the Switchboard as regards chalk boils down to a couple of fundamental rules;

- All things in the Switchboard are **made of chalk**.
- All things exist in a pattern-ribbon duality, in which **equations can be used to weave ribbon into pattern**, and to **unweave pattern back into ribbon form**.
- Interactions between things in the Switchboard **happen at the ribbon level**, and so, pattern must partially or fully unravel back into ribbon form for it to interact with other ribbon.

In addition to these rules is a final one;

- The properties of all things (patterns) in the Switchboard are a result of their weave, and 'properties' themselves are weave.

From these do we get the beginnings of the Switchboard's chemistry, the **Calcic Chemistry**, as it were.

As a note, it must be mentioned that the result of all things being made of weave, the Switchboard bears a marked difference from ours by virtue of the absence of the atom. In the Switchboard, the atom does not exist. There is only chalk.

### The World Without Atoms 
The ramifications of the elimination of the atom from the universe building tool box is such that what resulted from its existence and the rules it both created and was bound by must be replaced. We accomplish this using the chalk weave and the pattern-ribbon duality. Iron, for example, is hard, lustrous when polished, sonorous when struck, melts at a fixed temperature and a list of other qualities. These are all products of - in our world - its atomic makeup. In the Switchboard, iron's properties are the resultant of the various **property weaves** within it, the quantity and type of which determine the nature and behavior of all things in the Switchboard.

### Property Weaves
Property weaves are thus the cause of all **macroscopic material properties** held by things in the Switchboard. Hardness is a weave, and the absence of that weave is the cause of softness. Sonorousness upon physical blows is a weave as well. A weave controls the temperatures at which things melt and vaporize. Elasticity, texture, luster, resistance to corrosion, malleability, solubility, even color - all properties you can imagine are a result of weave baked into the pattern of the thing in question. The 'amount' or 'thickness' of the weave correlates with a mathematical scaling of the property it controls, in that thicker hardness weave results in harder objects, for example.

### Weave Chemistry
It follows then that the Weave Protocol which allows manipulation of weave and ribbon should then allow for the manipulation of weave in patterns in the Switchboard, and this is correct. The Weave Protocol does indeed allow for modification of weave within pattern, through unravelling pattern back into ribbon through the Five Straits, and altering the ribbon-state pattern as one sees fit. It should even follow that one could 'build' things purely from property weave, and this is true too. But Weave Chemistry is governed by a series of rules that add a layer of difficulty and constraint to what can be achieved by the Weave Protocol.

For one, creating property weave from weaving ribbon chalk is prohibitively difficult. Taking hardness weave for example, one could take a scion of hardness weave and replicate the pattern, but doing so is nigh impossible as property weaves as a whole are folded using immensely complex equations to produce exponentially more complex weave, and the equations for folding property weaves are...

>...perhaps unknown to all of Strider kind? Closely guarded secrets? Available to be found but hidden in the depths of the most treacherous Vaults or on Striders lost in Isalveh? Plenty of options here.

As such, nearly all property weave that exists must be **extracted** from things that possess it. Unravelling pattern in the Switchboard with a fair bit of delicacy and precision can yield property weave proportional to the amount present in the pattern (there is more hardness weave to be found in steel than rock, and in rock than wood), reduced slightly by an 'efficiency of extraction' in every Strider, controlled by their proficiency with the Weave Protocol.

Extraction and usage of property weave is done primarily using the **chalk ritualism**. If a Weaver doesn't know the equation to completely unravel a pattern, they are able to unravel via '**cutting along the seams**' of a pattern, to recover the weaves contained within. As the naming of such a method implies, it is attempting to deconstruct a shirt by cutting along lines rather than pulling out the string fastening, and care must be taken to not ruin weave in the process of extracting it. ^d5c612

The creation of property weave, however, is ironically best done through the natural processes that exist in our world. Armillary stars create the Wellsprings, and Wellsprings create the planets, and in the planets are the various patterns from which you would typically extract property weave are formed. The sheer complexity of a planetary equation is among the few things capable of folding the chalk from the Wellsprings linked to it via the seed clause, into the various patterns that become 'things' as we understand them, from rocks and trees to ore and metals. From these do Striders obtain property weave through various familiar processes; freezing, burning, crushing, mixing, separating, crystallizing, distilling, what have you. Chalk ritualism - as mentioned above - remain the foremost way to obtain property weave.

When this property weave is extracted, it takes the form of light paper almost, intricately patterned, thicker than normal paper, virtually indestructible in this physical ribbon state, and looking every part as something from a divine beyond. In this state can property weave be stored or used in further rituals by ritualists for a litany of purposes; modifying existing patterns, creating new ones, or casting calcic abilities in combat. Hardness weave, for example, inculcated into a shield weave enhances its defensive capabilities. However, property weave is also an expendable resource, and the usage of weave in this manner resolves it out of existence.

## Calcic Physics
We must define some rules that govern the mechanics of chalk in motion, and other relevant phenomena.

### Inductive Weave
There exists a phenomena inherent to some kinds of naturally occurring weave in which the weave is able to move from pattern to pattern by '**inducing**' itself in a target pattern while expending its '**presence**' from where it originated from. More simply put, heat and other phenomena in the Switchboard are weave that can spontaneously or otherwise move from pattern A to pattern B, in a manner that the amount of weave present in A reduces, and the amount in B increases. The efficiency with which heat-weave moves between subject patterns, as well as the ability of something that is heated to store that heat, are controlled by property weaves that bear real-world names of thermal conductivity and thermal capacity.

The two primary inductive weaves in the Switchboard are **heat** and **motion**. Motion can induce itself into other weave through avenues as simple as touch, translating almost perfectly to the real-world observable phenomena. Heat on the other hand, has a caveat, in that it is - in practice - more so motive weave that *disperses* its motion into the locality. 

> Problem: What prompts motive weave to disperse as heat?

The answer to this is - incredibly - *nothing*. There is no 'why'.

As the doctor put it;
> "I feel the desire for an answer here stems from a misconception. For example, suppose I asked you "What makes things fall down?" and you answered "gravity". What's actually happening here? You could say that the word 'gravity' is merely a label for a set of phenomena, namely the things-fall-down-set; in which case, if we taboo the word "gravity" and replace it with its meaning, we get 'things fall down because of the *things-fall-down-phenomena*'. Similarly, we might notice that "gravity", as a word, is an empty model. It provides no predictions. It doesn't tell you how _fast_ things fall down, when they fall and when they don't, etc. It is not useful. The _true answer_ to "what makes things fall down" is just: they do, and we simply observe _that they do_. We can describe _how_ they fall down in more detail, specify the conditions, establish patterns of what things fall down when and how fast, but there is no "why". It simply is." 
> "Likewise, motion simply _does_ disperse over time into what we perceive physiologically as "heat". We can specify in more detail under what circumstances motion does this, at what rate the motion degrades, etc. But there is no *why*."

#### Light
For the longest time, the Switchboard had a problem of light - or rather how light in the Switchboard worked. Due to the fact the verse has no atoms, and thus no electromagnetism, it is by extension lacking the various phenomena dependent or defined by the existence and nature of electromagnetism. This is in part why the Switchboard's internet analogue - the [[Communications and Compute#The DevitNet|DevitNet]] both exists and exists the way it does; the Switchboard has no electromagnetic waves and thus no radio and radio communications.

We thus had no way to justify the existence of Light, and the issue sat unresolved for the longest time.

**Until**;
> Light is an inductive weave that transmits color information. It is easily blocked by even thin boundaries, and without quantum mechanics there are no lasers to prevent it from dispersing. Its usage as communication is therefore limited to the scale of, say, binary code transmission via the mirrors and lamps of a lighthouse. Light is produced by specific materials - you can decide which - and obeys the simple laws of geometric optics, which means it allows for things like lenses.

Above is the good doctor's proposal, and perhaps the most salient proposal on the mechanics of light we have. I cannot think of any conceivable way to expand on the fundamentals, and as such I simply break down these fundamentals and tackle each in how they might be interacted with as mechanics of the verse.

> Light is an inductive weave that transmits color information.

This bit is the most immediately satisfying, as it solves the one problem that really mattered to me regarding light; baseline mechanics. With equations being responsible for folding chalk into weave, it is thus incredibly easy to say that the various equations of the Switchboard - especially naturally occurring ones - for reasons, have clauses built into them that light is produced from the process of folding chalk. 

> Light is produced by specific materials - you can decide which

Other things in the Switchboard, such as materials or minerals that glow, do so by having the emittance of light written into their patterns.

> It is easily blocked by even thin boundaries,

Fairly straightforward, though it begs the question of if transparent and translucent objects exist. Since they do, we must ascertain why light behaves differently to a window and a brick wall. My first, immediate answer is to refer back to Calcic Chemistry and propose the idea of '**opacity property weave**', and that patterns with greater and lesser opacity are thus more or less resistant to the surface-level alterations or inductions caused by light. Low opacity patterns allow light to pass through, rather than induce its effects on the first struck surface. High opacity objects obstruct light, catching much of its inductive effects on their immediate surface, and producing shadow behind them.

A thought that strikes me though, is that with light transmitting color information, does this mean that patterns in the Switchboard have no color until they are lit? I assert no, and instead, objects in the Switchboard have color by virtue of property weave, and in fact, the calcic [[The Hands as Chalk#Weavesight|Weavesight]] would let you determine the color of an object in a dark room - with enough Weavesight proficiency - by simply studying the pattern. Regular sight however, requires light to - say - 'activate' the color-weave on the surface of a pattern before it can be viewed. Armillary star light is pure white, and thus only induces **brightness** of **existing colors** in an object's property-weave. Colored light, created by equations, interacts somewhat differently, the induced color being folded in with the existing color and causing chromatic changes as we expect and observe from light normally.
 
> and without quantum mechanics there are no lasers to prevent it from dispersing.

This is a statement, but also;

> and obeys the simple laws of geometric optics, which means it allows for things like lenses.

I think we can't really have lasers as we understand them, but I do think it's possible to maybe, 'pipe' light down a tube using the mechanics of total internal reflection, considering light-weave still follows the laws of optics. It did then make me wonder how **mirrors** would work in the Switchboard, and whether there would be some means of manipulating opacity property-weave to make that possible. I pondered the idea of opacity being expressible as a numerical value capped at 100% and tending to zero, and then going *beyond* zero 'wrapped around' the mechanics of opacity to give you **reflectivity**, but after thinking about it further, I felt it would be simpler to have **opacity** and **reflectivity** be distinct property weaves.

> This does mean we need to discuss the various combinations of opacity and reflectivity and how objects with mixes of both behave when light-weave strikes them. Consider the table below;

|                         |  **Low Opacity**                               |  **High Opacity**             |
|:------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:------------------------------|
|  **Low Reflectivity**   |  Light passes through strongly                 |  Light is reflected weakly    |
|  **High Reflectivity**  |  Light passes through and is reflected weakly  |  Light is reflected strongly  |  

Regarding how light functions with lenses; it simply does. That much is settled.

> Its usage as communication is therefore limited to the scale of, say, binary code transmission via the mirrors and lamps of a lighthouse.

One of the major concerns of mine during the work on realizing light in the Switchboard was that there would be no means to do so without integrating quantum mechanics. I did not like this, as I considered it an inelegant solution to have developed thus far a relatively functional world using novel mechanics - only to balk at the finish line and throw in the towel. I was simply opposed to having these dual fundamental systems that didn't play very nice with each other.

More practically however, I was averse to integrating quantum mechanics to explain light as it thus asserted the existence of electromagnetism, and by extension other electromagnetic phenomena, such as radio waves. The existence of radio waves in particular prompted the question of "Why do people not use Wi-Fi in the Switchboard?" Radio waves would invalidate the need and thus existence of the DevitNet.

The doctor's suggestion was workable, but inelegant; they - the denizens of the verse - simply didn't know anything other than light existed. They just didn't look in the right places, or have any cause to look for anything in the first place. In truth, this works; the existence of the DevitNet would solidly dissuade most endeavors to find an alternative, and even if it - radio waves - were to be discovered, it would still be lacking compared to the DevitNet in various spheres, such as the inability to use it for Kache-Krashing operations.

The worldbuilder within me set about seeing how this could narratively be harnessed, such as having radio wave installations serve as a low-throughput, high-importance communications line for emergencies and high-priority or confidential transmissions like downed ships, Spyndl communications, the like (something that the **microlNet** would come to serve as, expanded upon under [[Communications and Compute]]). I played around with it even being a plot point that some antagonist faction was using radio waves - which they discovered and deliberately kept secret - to communicate and organize in a manner that the protagonists always seemed to be a few steps behind of.

Fortunately - depending on how you view these things - it didn't come down to that.

##### pNarrat: Bright Weaving
A litany of things produce light in the Switchboard. Among the most notable are many instances of chalkweaving; more elementary acts of chalkweaving, usage of complex chalk ritualism, and particularly when using various calcic-based techniques. But why is this so?

Initially, my justification was this;

> It could even be said that in instances of chalkweaving, producing light-weave is a very easy way to 'burn off' excess chalk that would be too much of a hassle to re-assimilate and/or utilize in other means. Even skilled Chalkweavers have tiny bits of waste chalk they can't harness or simply is too minute to expend effort worth harvesting, and so in the clauses of the operation of their computational strait, excess chalk is woven into light of established hue and intensity, and this light - being inductive weave - induces itself on the patterns surrounding the light's origin. 

> Things that glow in the Switchboard, or at least varying collections of things, do so because the weaving process isn't wholly efficient, and just like Striders flare excess velocity upon landing at a destination as heat, various equations have clauses built-in to dissipate unneeded chalk as light. 

Hex argued, however, that physics (and mechanical equivalents of it, such as what we have in Samsara) wouldn't differentiate between what is useful and what is 'waste', as waste is entirely an anthropocentric - human-centric - concept, far removed from the uncaring, impartial on-goings of sciences. While this is a thoroughly correct assertion to present, I do believe it stems from misinterpreting the original writ above, which described light as 'waste' solely because **chalkweavers** declared it so. I imagine the problem though, arises from the idea of the **equations** declaring some measure of chalk as waste and thus folding it into light, which would not be a logical dynamic to exist.

The real crux of the problem of this idea, is that it would mean skilled chalkweavers wouldn't emit light in their practice of chalkweaving, which is the direct opposite of what I wanted to achieve with regards to the visual elements of narrative.

Behold the rectification; the emission of light in various exercises of chalkweaving is instead a clause built into chalkweaving itself that indicates a litany of things, in particular the **amount/density** of chalk in chalkweave, and the **proficiency** with which the chalkweaving has been performed.

This means, most simply;
- Chalkweaving involving a lot of chalk produces a lot of light.
- Chalkweaving done really well produces more light too.

In practice, it tracks quite well when you consider phenomena such as the Switchboard's armillary stars, basins of colossal quantities of chalk, and how they are immensely bright, giving light to the entire Switchboard. Chalk rituals as well - under these rules - emit considerable amounts of light, and more so when they are done with as stringent as possible adherence to their schema.

In addition to this though, is the relevance of light to the concept of [[The Doctrine of Passing#pNarrat Infamy|Infamy]] that exists with regards to Striders in the Switchboard.

## Hyperweave
By most metrics, chalk can be viewed as somewhat inert. Chalk in latent dust form, solid crystalline form, activated ribbon form, bound pattern form and stable weave form all share a somewhat common thread between them; they are stable forms of chalk that outside of most calcic interference, will remain in their current states. There is a final form of chalk however, that is defined by the extreme conditions necessary for its formation - and by extension the extreme nature of the chalk itself.

This is chalk in the 'hyperwoven' state, more commonly referred to as **hyperweave**.

### Nature & Formation
When pattern undergoes the rather unrefined physical compression, it can be done to a fairly considerable degree with suitable conditions - but only up to a point. Beyond a certain threshold, the unstable structure begins to show signs of failing, and the distinction of and within the pattern gradually begins to **degenerate**. The resultant is a churning, furious, calcic slurry, merely awaiting an outlet under the immense pressure. As it is nearly impossible to exert and maintain uniform pressure across the entire compression front, inevitably something must give in the over-structure, and the pressurized calcic slurry surges out and forth - crackling with violent animation - as **hyperweave**. 

Upon being provided with an outlet - an **aperture** - hyperweave is able to form and be released into the local environment, the preferred shape it takes being that of frenzied, discordant bolts, crackling outwards and in nearly random directions. Typically, once hyperweave is released into the environment, it is skewed by minute spatial distortion, and thus typically crackles towards the most chalk-dense entity in the vicinity - this often being Striders, presenting a considerable hazard towards them.

The manner in which hyperweave is released is determined primarily by the **shape of the aperture** that is provided to the undifferentiated calcic slurry that serves as its birthplace. With no true aperture provided, hyperweave surges outwards towards the most calcically dense subject in the vicinity, and - if possible - tears the aperture from which it emerges open further, resulting in it beginning as a fairly powerful release, then tapering off at the end. As it is released, the pressure exerted by the compression front is no longer present, and the repulsive support substructures violently restore themselves to their original state, resulting in the hyperweave structure collapsing as it travels, in an attempt to restore itself to the original pattern shape from which it was made. The degeneration of the pattern structure, however, is often permanent, and hyperweave tends to resolve itself into calcic ribbon once released into the environment.

That being said, for the brief moments it exists, it is a truly mighty phenomenon, travelling at speeds rivalling the Strider Protocol and inflicting considerable lattice damage to whatever it strikes. Based on the release aperture it is provided, hyperweave can be restrained to **beams**, increasing its lifespan in the environment, the distance it can travel, and its destructive potential. 

### Utilization
One of the larger-scale applications of hyperweave exists in industry - [[Switchboard Technology]] - as hyperweave is an immensely effective means to move colossal amounts of chalk over equally colossal distances. **Emitter** and **receiver** apparatus are able to form and launch beams of hyperweave, and 'catch' it at a destination. When working under ultra-long-distance applications as this, **relay** apparatus that **re-compress** hyperweave midflight, as well as **rifled release apertures** that stabilize it via applying **spin** are used to move hyperweave across interplanetary distances, facilitating grand applications such as Wellspring drilling and powering interstellar fleets - and even small, even *minuscule* applications such as powering minute devices.

> Further elaboration on this will be done in [[Switchboard Technology]].

On smaller scale however, hyperweave is used by Striders and other denizens of the Switchboard as a **weapon**, due to the considerable [[Weave and Warfare#Unravelling|unravelling]] effect it has on lattices.

### Effects
Being hit by hyperweave has been described as - and is particularly similar to - being hit by the full calcic radiance of a armillary star. Though less powerful, it rips and cascades through the lattice of a target, inflicting considerable unravelling, and saturating a target with unharnessed, wild chalk. It takes on inductive properties and can ricochet throughout the lattice, and even strike a target, reform, and ricochet to another target, chaining between them and doing substantial, though diminishing damage. 

One of the greatest dangers presented by hyperweave is hyperweave formed from pattern that is able to **re-differentiate** itself with time, resulting in hyperweave that can resolve into - say - the large object that was compressed to form it. Should this re-differentiation happen *within* the lattice of a Strider, the results can be catastrophic, akin to detonating a bomb within their very body.

### Chalkweaver Combat
Hyperweave saw inevitable adoption in combat due to the considerable damage it does to all that it strikes, as well as its chaining, unravelling and inductive properties. How each individual subject used hyperweave - harnessing its raw damage potential, suppressing unravelling power, or spreading inductive power - is up to them. But those who can harness hyperweave cultivate considerable notoriety, as hyperweave in use is a memorable, visual spectacle, one to wow allies, foes and onlookers alike. 

Generally, forming hyperweave in combat must account for the context that *is* an active engagement, and as such, forming hyperweave needs to be **fast** to be worthwhile. For this reason, Striders who are able to harness hyperweave are only capable of doing so via **exploiting** the foundational mechanics behind its formation, via **assistance** by some other power they possess - and often a mix of both. It is very commonplace to see [[Weave and Warfare#Pale Amaran|Pale Amarans]] use hyperweave, as one of the most practical ways to get the compressive force needed to form hyperweave, as well as a large enough supply of chalk to compress, is through **curvature manipulation** and **access to the Stardrip Cycle** respectively.

#### Cosmological Genesis
> This section will replace 'Spontaneous Equations' in HandsChalk.

There are two critical takeaways from the good doctor's notes;

- **Armillary stars** are, in reality, colossal **hyperweave engines**.
- **Cooling hyperweave** can give rise to the emergence of **complex weft structures**. 

This proposal is a revision to one of the most pivotal, foundation mechanics upon which the Switchboard operates; [[The Hands as Chalk#Spontaneous Equations|spontaneous equations]] as described under the mechanics of chalk. These were equations that, under the right conditions, arose from latent chalk in the environment and folded chalk around them into incredibly complex patterns. But what on earth could be the 'right conditions'? What would be the seed necessary for such a thing to take place.

The doctor outlined the answer to that question already, but I will restate it here; **hyperweave cooling**. 

![[The Hands as Chalk#Spontaneous Equations]]
