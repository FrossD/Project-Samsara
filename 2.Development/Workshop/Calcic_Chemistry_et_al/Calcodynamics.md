# Calcodynamics: Calcimistry & Calcic Physics
Some hard rules (almost) on working chalk at the ribbon level.

## Calcimistry
The nature of the Switchboard as regards chalk boils down to a couple of fundamental rules;

- All things in the Switchboard are **made of chalk**.
- All things exist in a pattern-ribbon duality, in which **equations can be used to weave ribbon into pattern**, and to **unweave pattern back into ribbon form**.
- Interactions between things in the Switchboard **happen at the ribbon level**, and so, pattern must partially or fully unravel back into ribbon form for it to interact with other ribbon.

In addition to these rules is a final one;

- The properties of all things (patterns) in the Switchboard are a result of their weave, and 'properties' themselves are weave.

From these do we get the beginnings of the Switchboard's chemistry, the **Calcic Chemistry**, as it were.

As a note, it must be mentioned that the result of all things being made of weave, the Switchboard bears a marked difference from ours by virtue of the absence of the atom. In the Switchboard, the atom does not exist. There is only chalk.

### The World Without Atoms 
The ramifications of the elimination of the atom from the universe building tool box is such that what resulted from its existence and the rules it both created and was bound by must be replaced. We accomplish this using the chalk weave and the pattern-ribbon duality. Iron, for example, is hard, lustrous when polished, sonorous when struck, melts at a fixed temperature and a list of other qualities. These are all products of - in our world - its atomic makeup. In the Switchboard, iron's properties are the resultant of the various **property weaves** within it, the quantity and type of which determine the nature and behavior of all things in the Switchboard.

### Property Weaves
Property weaves are thus the cause of all **macroscopic material properties** held by things in the Switchboard. Hardness is a weave, and the absence of that weave is the cause of softness. Sonorousness upon physical blows is a weave as well. A weave controls the temperatures at which things melt and vaporize. Elasticity, texture, luster, resistance to corrosion, malleability, solubility, even color - all properties you can imagine are a result of weave baked into the pattern of the thing in question. The 'amount' or 'thickness' of the weave correlates with a mathematical scaling of the property it controls, in that thicker hardness weave results in harder objects, for example.

### Weave Chemistry
It follows then that the Weave Protocol which allows manipulation of weave and ribbon should then allow for the manipulation of weave in patterns in the Switchboard, and this is correct. The Weave Protocol does indeed allow for modification of weave within pattern, through unravelling pattern back into ribbon through the Five Straits, and altering the ribbon-state pattern as one sees fit. It should even follow that one could 'build' things purely from property weave, and this is true too. But Weave Chemistry is governed by a series of rules that add a layer of difficulty and constraint to what can be achieved by the Weave Protocol.

For one, creating property weave from weaving ribbon chalk is prohibitively difficult. Taking hardness weave for example, one could take a scion of hardness weave and replicate the pattern, but doing so is nigh impossible as property weaves as a whole are folded using immensely complex equations to produce exponentially more complex weave, and the equations for folding property weaves are...

>...perhaps unknown to all of Strider kind? Closely guarded secrets? Available to be found but hidden in the depths of the most treacherous Vaults or on Striders lost in Isalveh? Plenty of options here.

As such, nearly all property weave that exists must be **extracted** from things that possess it. Unravelling pattern in the Switchboard with a fair bit of delicacy and precision can yield property weave proportional to the amount present in the pattern (there is more hardness weave to be found in steel than rock, and in rock than wood), reduced slightly by an 'efficiency of extraction' in every Strider, controlled by their proficiency with the Weave Protocol.

Extraction and usage of property weave is done primarily using the **chalk ritualism**. If a Weaver doesn't know the equation to completely unravel a pattern, they are able to unravel via '**cutting along the seams**' of a pattern, to recover the weaves contained within. As the naming of such a method implies, it is attempting to deconstruct a shirt by cutting along lines rather than pulling out the string fastening, and care must be taken to not ruin weave in the process of extracting it. ^d5c612

The creation of property weave, however, is ironically best done through the natural processes that exist in our world. Law Stars create the Wellsprings, and Wellsprings create the regions, and in the regions are the various patterns from which you would typically extract property weave are formed. The sheer complexity of a regional equation is among the few things capable of folding the chalk from the Wellsprings linked to it via the seed clause, into the various patterns that become 'things' as we understand them, from rocks and trees to ore and metals. From these do Striders obtain property weave through various familiar processes; freezing, burning, crushing, mixing, separating, crystallizing, distilling, what have you. Chalk ritualism - as mentioned above - remain the foremost way to obtain property weave.

When this property weave is extracted, it takes the form of light paper almost, intricately patterned, thicker than normal paper, virtually indestructible in this physical ribbon state, and looking every part as something from a divine beyond. In this state can property weave be stored or used in further rituals by ritualists for a litany of purposes; modifying existing patterns, creating new ones, or casting calcic abilities in combat. Hardness weave, for example, inculcated into a shield weave enhances its defensive capabilities. However, property weave is also an expendable resource, and the usage of weave in this manner resolves it out of existence.

## Calcic Physics
We must define some rules that govern the mechanics of chalk in motion, and other relevant phenomena.

### Inductive Weave
There exists a phenomena inherent to some kinds of naturally occurring weave in which the weave is able to move from pattern to pattern by '**inducing**' itself in a target pattern while expending its '**presence**' from where it originated from. More simply put, heat and other phenomena in the Switchboard are weave that can spontaneously or otherwise move from pattern A to pattern B, in a manner that the amount of weave present in A reduces, and the amount in B increases. The efficiency with which heat-weave moves between subject patterns, as well as the ability of something that is heated to store that heat, are controlled by property weaves that bear real-world names of thermal conductivity and thermal capacity.

The two primary inductive weaves in the Switchboard are **heat** and **motion**. Motion can induce itself into other weave through avenues as simple as touch, translating almost perfectly to the real-world observable phenomena. Heat on the other hand, has a caveat, in that it is - in practice - more so motive weave that *disperses* its motion into the locality. 

> Problem: What prompts motive weave to disperse as heat?

The answer to this is - incredibly - *nothing*. There is no 'why'.

As the doctor put it;
> "I feel the desire for an answer here stems from a misconception. For example, suppose I asked you "What makes things fall down?" and you answered "gravity". What's actually happening here? You could say that the word 'gravity' is merely a label for a set of phenomena, namely the things-fall-down-set; in which case, if we taboo the word "gravity" and replace it with its meaning, we get 'things fall down because of the *things-fall-down-phenomena*'. Similarly, we might notice that "gravity", as a word, is an empty model. It provides no predictions. It doesn't tell you how _fast_ things fall down, when they fall and when they don't, etc. It is not useful. The _true answer_ to "what makes things fall down" is just: they do, and we simply observe _that they do_. We can describe _how_ they fall down in more detail, specify the conditions, establish patterns of what things fall down when and how fast, but there is no "why". It simply is." 
> "Likewise, motion simply _does_ disperse over time into what we perceive physiologically as "heat". We can specify in more detail under what circumstances motion does this, at what rate the motion degrades, etc. But there is no *why*."

#### Light
For the longest time, the Switchboard had a problem of light - or rather how light in the Switchboard worked. Due to the fact the verse has no atoms, and thus no electromagnetism, it is by extension lacking the various phenomena dependent or defined by the existence and nature of electromagnetism. This is in part why the Switchboard's internet analogue - the [[Communications and Compute#The DevitNet|DevitNet]] both exists and exists the way it does; the Switchboard has no electromagnetic waves and thus no radio and radio communications.

We thus had no way to justify the existence of Light, and the issue sat unresolved for the longest time.

**Until**;
> Light is an inductive weave that transmits color information. It is easily blocked by even thin boundaries, and without quantum mechanics there are no lasers to prevent it from dispersing. Its usage as communication is therefore limited to the scale of, say, binary code transmission via the mirrors and lamps of a lighthouse. Light is produced by specific materials - you can decide which - and obeys the simple laws of geometric optics, which means it allows for things like lenses.

Above is the good doctor's proposal, and perhaps the most salient proposal on the mechanics of light we have. I cannot think of any conceivable way to expand on the fundamentals, and as such I simply break down these fundamentals and tackle each in how they might be interacted with as mechanics of the verse.

> Light is an inductive weave that transmits color information.

This bit is the most immediately satisfying, as it solves the one problem that really mattered to me regarding light; baseline mechanics. With equations being responsible for folding chalk into weave, it is thus incredibly easy to say that the various equations of the Switchboard - especially naturally occurring ones - for reasons, have clauses built into them that light is produced from the process of folding chalk. 

> Light is produced by specific materials - you can decide which

It could even be said that in instances of chalkweaving, producing light-weave is a very easy way to 'burn off' excess chalk that would be too much of a hassle to re-assimilate and/or utilize in other means. Even skilled Chalkweavers have tiny bits of waste chalk they can't harness or simply is to minute to expend effort worth harvesting, and so in the clauses of the operation of their computational strait, excess chalk is woven into light of established hue and intensity, and this light - being inductive weave - induces itself on the patterns surrounding the light's origin. 

Things that glow in the Switchboard, or at least varying collections of things, do so because the weaving process isn't wholly efficient, and just like Striders flare excess velocity upon landing at a destination as heat, various equations have clauses built-in to dissipate unneeded chalk as light. 

Other things in the Switchboard, such as materials or minerals that glow, do so by having the emittance of light written into their patterns.

> It is easily blocked by even thin boundaries,

Fairly straightforward, though it begs the question of if transparent and translucent objects exist. Since they do, we must ascertain why light behaves differently to a window and a brick wall. My first, immediate answer is to refer back to Calcic Chemistry and propose the idea of '**opacity property weave**', and that patterns with greater and lesser opacity are thus more or less resistant to the surface-level alterations or inductions caused by light. Low opacity patterns allow light to pass through, rather than induce its effects on the first struck surface. High opacity objects obstruct light, catching much of its inductive effects on their immediate surface, and producing shadow behind them.

A thought that strikes me though, is that with light transmitting color information, does this mean that patterns in the Switchboard have no color until they are lit? I assert no, and instead, objects in the Switchboard have color by virtue of property weave, and in fact, the calcic [[The Hands as Chalk#Weavesight|Weavesight]] would let you determine the color of an object in a dark room - with enough Weavesight proficiency - by simply studying the pattern. Regular sight however, requires light to - say - 'activate' the color-weave on the surface of a pattern before it can be viewed. Law star light is pure white, and thus only induces **brightness** of **existing colors** in an object's property-weave. Colored light, created by equations, interacts somewhat differently, the induced color being folded in with the existing color and causing chromatic changes as we expect and observe from light normally.

> and without quantum mechanics there are no lasers to prevent it from dispersing.

This is a statement, but also;

> and obeys the simple laws of geometric optics, which means it allows for things like lenses.

I think we can't really have lasers as we understand them, but I do think it's possible to maybe, 'pipe' light down a tube using the mechanics of total internal reflection, considering light-weave still follows the laws of optics. It did then make me wonder how **mirrors** would work in the Switchboard, and whether there would be some means of manipulating opacity property-weave to make that possible. I pondered the idea of opacity being expressible as a numerical value capped at 100% and tending to zero, and then going *beyond* zero 'wrapped around' the mechanics of opacity to give you **reflectivity**, but after thinking about it further, I felt it would be simpler to have **opacity** and **reflectivity** be distinct property weaves.

> This does mean we need to discuss the various combinations of opacity and reflectivity and how objects with mixes of both behave when light-weave strikes them. Consider the table below;

|                         |  **Low Opacity**                               |  **High Opacity**             |
|:------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:------------------------------|
|  **Low Reflectivity**   |  Light passes through strongly                 |  Light is reflected weakly    |
|  **High Reflectivity**  |  Light passes through and is reflected weakly  |  Light is reflected strongly  |  

Regarding how light functions with lenses; it simply does. That much is settled.

> Its usage as communication is therefore limited to the scale of, say, binary code transmission via the mirrors and lamps of a lighthouse.

One of the major concerns of mine during the work on realizing light in the Switchboard was that there would be no means to do so without integrating quantum mechanics. I did not like this, as I considered it an inelegant solution to have developed thus far a relatively functional world using novel mechanics - only to balk at the finish line and throw in the towel. I was simply opposed to having these dual fundamental systems that didn't play very nice with each other.

More practically however, I was averse to integrating quantum mechanics to explain light as it thus asserted the existence of electromagnetism, and by extension other electromagnetic phenomena, such as radio waves. The existence of radio waves in particular prompted the question of "Why do people not use Wi-Fi in the Switchboard?" Radio waves would invalidate the need and thus existence of the DevitNet.

The doctor's suggestion was workable, but inelegant; they - the denizens of the verse - simply didn't know anything other than light existed. They just didn't look in the right places, or have any cause to look for anything in the first place. In truth, this works; the existence of the DevitNet would solidly dissuade most endeavors to find an alternative, and even if it - radio waves - were to be discovered, it would still be lacking compared to the DevitNet in various spheres, such as the inability to use it for Kache-Krashing operations.

The worldbuilder within me set about seeing how this could narratively be harnessed, such as having radio wave installations serve as a low-throughput, high-importance communications line for emergencies and high-priority or confidential transmissions like downed ships, Spyndl communications, the like (something that the **microlNet** would come to serve as, expanded upon under [[Communications and Compute]]). I played around with it even being a plot point that some antagonist faction was using radio waves - which they discovered and deliberately kept secret - to communicate and organize in a manner that the protagonists always seemed to be a few steps behind of.

Fortunately - depending on how you view these things - it didn't come down to that.
