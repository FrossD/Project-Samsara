# Calcodynamics: Calcimistry & Calcic Physics
Some hard rules (almost) on working chalk at the ribbon level.

## Calcimistry
The nature of the Switchboard as regards chalk boils down to a couple of fundamental rules;

- All things in the Switchboard are **made of chalk**.
- All things exist in a pattern-ribbon duality, in which **equations can be used to weave ribbon into pattern**, and to **unweave pattern back into ribbon form**.
- Interactions between things in the Switchboard **happen at the ribbon level**, and so, pattern must partially or fully unravel back into ribbon form for it to interact with other ribbon.

In addition to these rules is a final one;

- The properties of all things (patterns) in the Switchboard are a result of their weave, and 'properties' themselves are weave.

From these do we get the beginnings of the Switchboard's chemistry, the **Calcic Chemistry**, as it were.

As a note, it must be mentioned that the result of all things being made of weave, the Switchboard bears a marked difference from ours by virtue of the absence of the atom. In the Switchboard, the atom does not exist. There is only chalk.

### The World Without Atoms 
The ramifications of the elimination of the atom from the universe building tool box is such that what resulted from its existence and the rules it both created and was bound by must be replaced. We accomplish this using the chalk weave and the pattern-ribbon duality. Iron, for example, is hard, lustrous when polished, sonorous when struck, melts at a fixed temperature and a list of other qualities. These are all products of - in our world - its atomic makeup. In the Switchboard, iron's properties are the resultant of the various **property weaves** within it, the quantity and type of which determine the nature and behavior of all things in the Switchboard.

### Property Weaves
Property weaves are thus the cause of all **macroscopic material properties** held by things in the Switchboard. Hardness is a weave, and the absence of that weave is the cause of softness. Sonorousness upon physical blows is a weave as well. A weave controls the temperatures at which things melt and vaporize. Elasticity, texture, luster, resistance to corrosion, malleability, solubility, even color - all properties you can imagine are a result of weave baked into the pattern of the thing in question. The 'amount' or 'thickness' of the weave correlates with a mathematical scaling of the property it controls, in that thicker hardness weave results in harder objects, for example.

### Weave Chemistry
It follows then that the Weave Protocol which allows manipulation of weave and ribbon should then allow for the manipulation of weave in patterns in the Switchboard, and this is correct. The Weave Protocol does indeed allow for modification of weave within pattern, through unravelling pattern back into ribbon through the Five Straits, and altering the ribbon-state pattern as one sees fit. It should even follow that one could 'build' things purely from property weave, and this is true too. But Weave Chemistry is governed by a series of rules that add a layer of difficulty and constraint to what can be achieved by the Weave Protocol.

For one, creating property weave from weaving ribbon chalk is prohibitively difficult. Taking hardness weave for example, one could take a scion of hardness weave and replicate the pattern, but doing so is nigh impossible as property weaves as a whole are folded using immensely complex equations to produce exponentially more complex weave, and the equations for folding property weaves are...

>...perhaps unknown to all of Strider kind? Closely guarded secrets? Available to be found but hidden in the depths of the most treacherous Vaults or on Striders lost in Isalveh? Plenty of options here.

As such, nearly all property weave that exists must be **extracted** from things that possess it. Unravelling pattern in the Switchboard with a fair bit of delicacy and precision can yield property weave proportional to the amount present in the pattern (there is more hardness weave to be found in steel than rock, and in rock than wood), reduced slightly by an 'efficiency of extraction' in every Strider, controlled by their proficiency with the Weave Protocol.

Extraction and usage of property weave is done primarily using the **chalk ritualism**. If a Weaver doesn't know the equation to completely unravel a pattern, they are able to unravel via '**cutting along the seams**' of a pattern, to recover the weaves contained within. As the naming of such a method implies, it is attempting to deconstruct a shirt by cutting along lines rather than pulling out the string fastening, and care must be taken to not ruin weave in the process of extracting it.

The creation of property weave, however, is ironically best done through the natural processes that exist in our world. Law Stars create the Wellsprings, and Wellsprings create the regions, and in the regions are the various patterns from which you would typically extract property weave are formed. The sheer complexity of a regional equation is among the few things capable of folding the chalk from the Wellsprings linked to it via the seed clause, into the various patterns that become 'things' as we understand them, from rocks and trees to ore and metals. From these do Striders obtain property weave through various familiar processes; freezing, burning, crushing, mixing, separating, crystallizing, distilling, what have you. Chalk ritualism - as mentioned above - remain the foremost way to obtain property weave.

When this property weave is extracted, it takes the form of light paper almost, intricately patterned, thicker than normal paper, virtually indestructible in this physical ribbon state, and looking every part as something from a divine beyond. In this state can property weave be stored or used in further rituals by ritualists for a litany of purposes; modifying existing patterns, creating new ones, or casting calcic abilities in combat. Hardness weave, for example, inculcated into a shield weave enhances its defensive capabilities. However, property weave is also an expendable resource, and the usage of weave in this manner resolves it out of existence.

## Calcic Physics
We must define some rules that govern the mechanics of chalk in motion. 

### Inductive Weave
There exists a phenomena inherent to some kinds of naturally occurring weave in which the weave is able to move from pattern to pattern by '**inducing**' itself in a target pattern while expending its '**presence**' from where it originated from. More simply put, heat and other phenomena in the Switchboard are weave that can spontaneously or otherwise move from pattern A to pattern B, in a manner that the amount of weave present in A reduces, and the amount in B increases. The efficiency with which heat-weave moves between subject patterns, as well as the ability of something that is heated to store that heat, are controlled by property weaves that bear real-world names of thermal conductivity and thermal capacity.

The two primary inductive weaves in the Switchboard are **heat** and **motion**. Motion can induce itself into other weave through avenues as simple as touch, translating almost perfectly to the real-world observable phenomena. Heat on the other hand, has a caveat, in that it is - in practice - more so motive weave that *disperses* its motion into the locality.
