# Cryogen's Proposal: The Families
A section related to the work on the Great Families of the Switchboard, this one devoted to family-related proposals.

## Scope
The family proposals can be read much like appendum to the much larger family document they build off of. Rather than rewriting every family document whenever a major bit of canon is added to them, it is far more reasonable to simply have them here, as additional information and detail on matters related to the family.

In some cases - though it will be greatly avoided as much as possible - there may be conflicts between the contents of a family proposal and the family document. In those circumstances, the family proposal - by virtue of being the most recent - should take precedence. That being said, grievous breaks in parity will be rectified sooner rather than later.

## The Fel-Arcad
### The Order of the Undersol
There exists a discrepancy, a disconnect of sorts among the Fel-Arcad, particularly as regards the administrative structure of the arcologies within which they have come to dwell. This disconnect emerges as a result of the inability to wholly define the place, purpose and thus powers of the Craun Tenders and the Craun Soleri.

In the before-times, the Craun Soleri served both purposes; building and overseeing the arcology as well as the people within it. But as it became apparent that the skillsets needed to warp replichrome and lead people were considerably different from one another, and Soleri as a whole - with time - seemed to be becoming more and more eccentric in their zealotry around the arcologies - often to the detriment of every other thing imaginable, it thus became necessary to divide powers, and thus confer the authority to administrate people upon a newly-formed body. 

However, it became difficult to define what truly were the edges and extents of the Tenders' and the Soleri's power, as the Fel-Arcad as a people - by design - live in such deep interconnection with the arcologies they dwell within that any decision taken by one would inadvertently, inescapably affect the other. For the Craun Tenders, this was expected and justifiable; the logics of governance doctrine by which they operated defined that choosing the well-being of the Fel-Arcad peoples over the physical structure they dwelt within was almost always the objectively correct decision.

The Soleri, however, disagreed. In perhaps a gradual warping of their original purpose that would come to be studied by many who would curiously disappear in the workings of obtaining any conclusive deductions, the Soleri came to view the preservation of the arcologies - the physical structure - as their highest charge, rather than service to the Fel-Arcad peoples, believing that upholding and propagating the arcologies and their derivate doctrine would serve the function of protecting and serving the Fel-Arcad by proxy. And with the Craun Tenders seizing much of their power and now acting above them in hierarchy, they sought to reclaim a grasp on affairs, while minimizing the damage that would have to be caused to obtain it, as well as avoid betraying their intentions. 

And thus - learning, perhaps, from their Rosenthalist ideological cousins - they took on the mantle of subterfuge and the blades of deceit, and formed the **Order of the Undersol**; a Soleri-aligned faction that would work to protect the sanctity of the arcologies from the Fel-Arcad that threatened them, and the Craun Tenders that protected those Fel-Arcad in their 'ignorance'. This aim is achieved through - primarily - the establishment of a covert, arcology-wide surveillance substructure that actively and passively monitors all Fel-Arcad within an arcology, maintaining comprehensive profiles on each. These profiles are fed into purpose-built algorithms that then compute along a slide-rule of compatibility; a numerical measure of how well one can dwell in the arcology environment. 

In a sense, they build and operate surveillance states.

Should certain Fel-Arcad be identified that are viewable as threats to the arcology structure, the Order of the Undersol works towards their elimination. Preferring to avoid outright - even if covert - murder, their major strategies are 're-acclimatization' and exile. The latter is fairly simple, in that the Undersol works towards finding a means to dismiss the subject entirely from the arcology. The methods under *this* are - expectedly - hardly the cleanest, ranging from falsifying information, to framing a subject, to outright psychological warfare to instill a fear of the arcology environment, and thus a need to flee it.

It is the former, re-acclimatization, that is the Undersol's specialty. The Soleri - in all this - understand better than anyone that the arcology model succeeds only with maximal cooperation, from as many Fel-Arcad as possible. Thus they are incentivized to, rather than dismiss subjects they find problematic, instead divide them into groups, with one group being those that would respond well to what is fundamentally psychological warfare strategies. Primarily, they work with three aims in mind;

- Foster pro-arcology and pro-Fel sentiment.
- Cultivate fear, distrust and general ill-will towards the outside world.
- Coerce the formation of 'ties' to the arcology, such as unions or long-term careers.

The latter is perhaps their most insidious, in that their primary stratagem is extensive manipulation of a subject and other parties around them, to cultivate relationships between those who wish to leave an arcology, and others. Because eventually, the Soleri realized that the greatest danger to the arcology wasn't unknowing or even deliberate saboteurs, nor the Craun Tenders that inadvertently enabled them; it was those who grew disillusioned with the arcologies and sought another path outside. These are the primary targets of the Order of the Undersol; ordinary Fel who dare suspect that a better lot awaits them beyond the walls of the arcologies.

Commanded by the pocketed hand of the Soleri, the Order of the Undersol works in the shadows, monitoring the affairs of all Fel-Arcad, under the singular charge that as few as possible are allowed to leave the arcologies, lest the entire institution be undermined, and the mechanics of praxis see the Soleri fade into obscurity. It is the simple fact that the demise of the Soleri and by extension, the craft of arcology building, would most likely lead to the widespread demise of the Fel-Arcad people - that is the final justification for the actions of the Soleri and the Undersol; nothing greater, ironically, than the mere need to survive. 

### The Canon of the Rosenthalists
The Rosenthalists have a number of ideas and doctrines ascribed to them, that set them apart - often rather starkly - from their Fel-Arcad cousins. At the most elementary, and perhaps what sets them apart the most from other Fel, is their belief that the descend directly from Arcad Rosen, the foremost of the Arcad at the time, and later Fel-Arcad. While the Rosenthalists believe that the other Fel-Arcad did indeed also descend from the other Arcad that existed at the time, they claim direct descendance from Rosen himself.

And why in particular they espouse their supremacist doctrine is due to Arcad Rosen having taken a **Danseer** as a partner. Their union is believed to have yielded triplets of Arcad and Danseer heritage, leading them to concluded that - on pure calcic basis - they had possibly the strongest calcic backbone at the time, combining the power of the Danseers with the proficiency of the Arcad.

From these triplets - **Roslet**, **Aavar**, and **Hiorti** - the Rosenthalist trace the three of their great Courts; the **Roslettes**, the **Avarosi** and the **Hiortros**, and to a large extent, every Rosenthalist by birth traces their descendance from one of these three. 

In the earliest days of the dawning era of the Third Kin, following the differentiation into what would become the Great Families of today, Rosen's descendants - spurned on by their Danseer heritage, as it's been theorized - did indeed attempt to lead the then-Arcad by first cultivating names for themselves in battle, much like the Danseer Skydancers they both lauded and claimed heritage with, and then working to convince the Fel-Arcad to support them in their lofty ambitions for dominance over the Dancirah, in much the same way as - again - the Danseers practiced. However, their aims and methods ran afoul of their father, Arcad Rosen, and the Arcad of the time who had already been majorly swayed by Rosen's manners of thinking. For this reason, the triplets faded into relative obscurity, instead being relegated to merely the spearheads of the Arcad war effort, and eventually leading the Mind Hunts in the fifth - final -  offensive.

It was not long after this that the Refrain struck, and brought about the fall of the Arcad into the now Fel. It was also around this time, or at least some bit earlier, that the document known as the **Redsight** was penned by Arcad Rosen, and it would later form the core of much of Rosenthalist thought. It is unknown why this document was written at all however, and conclusions ranged from dying making him a cynical pessimist, an epiphany had on death's door, or - perhaps the most interesting of all - that it was written as a way to connect with his descendants, in the most Arcad way of all; the conveyance, exchange and entertainment of ideas.

The Fel-Arcad would then go through the nomadic period in their history, and it was during this time that the descendants of the original triplets took on the mantle of their ancestor-kin, refusing to be defined by the tragedy they had been struck with, choosing instead to organize into the Rosenthalist **Courts** as they are now known, secretive circles that sought to preserve and uphold what they believed to be the true wishes of Arcad Rosen and Arcad thought. At the crux of this sentiment was that of a grand ideological victory brought about by the homogenization of peoples, and thus, the homogenization of thought. By ensuring - in a sense - that the Arcad were the dominant thinking beings in the Switchboard, they would demonstrate the purity of their selves and their doctrine, and thus be able to further uphold that same doctrine. Arcad Rosen's egalitarian ideals of fairness and empowerment were only possible when all believed similar, and achieving that aim would require first building a Switchboard of only those receptive of - or already entertaining of - Rosen's ideals. The Redsight, they felt, was justification for this line of thinking, as even Arcad Rosen himself had entertained such ideas.

Thus, the three Rosenthalist factions rapidly built up strength in the Switchboard, doing so by wearing many faces; faces to deal with the other families such as the Sil'khan and the Lancasters, faces to deal with their Fel cousins, faces to deal with each other. But below these masks was forever the core Rosenthalist belief; that they were still Arcad, still descended of a Danseer, still mighty - mightier than all others - by virtue of heritage and doctrine. They were, by all worthwhile metrics and even plenty not so, superior to all other beings that walked the Switchboard, and believed that achieving their ancestor Rosen's vision of peace in the Switchboard would first require that all who would challenge both the reality of their ontology and Rosen's ideals to be subjugated - or annihilated.

It was for this reason and others that they abhorred the Sanscrii arcology when it was built, abhorred the ArcDanseer Nadira when they claimed to speak for Rosen, abhorred the Semblance Doctrine that spilled from his lips, and abhorred their Nadiran Fel cousins for being so eager and willing to take in this doctrine when it was proffered. All of it, to them, was capital heresy, and beyond merely marring the name of Arcad Rosen, it was polluting the Arcad totality with doctrine that they had no reason to believe had ever been proposed by Arcad Rosen. 

It was concluded by the Rosenthalists at large that before their more widespread goal of preparing a Switchboard that only the Arcad could inhabit could take place, they would first have to cleanse the rot that had festered among their own cousins. It is on this note that we then go on to discuss how each Rosenthalist Court manifested the doctrine of their own believed superiority over the other denizens of the Switchboard;

- The descendants of Aavar, the **Avarosi**, and their methodologies of **economic dominance**, **sabotage** and **subterfuge**.
- The descendants of Hiorti, the **Hiortros**, and their methodology of **militancy** and **subjugation**.
- The descendants of Roslet, the **Roslettes**, and their methodology of **ascension**.

The **Avarosi** are perhaps the most forward-facing and yet clandestine of the Rosenthalist courts. Even while active adherents of their beliefs of supremacy, they envision a battle that is won by gradually weakening an enemy by building up their reliance on external powers, while weakening the trust and reliability of internal ones. Through infiltration and subterfuge, they weaken the institutions of other parties in the Switchboard, making them wholly reliant on the Avarosi for a litany of their needs, and gradually eliminating their self-sufficiency and eroding the trust they have in each other. Avarosi agents work with only one thing in mind; dismantlement. By eliminating all opposition without even shedding blood, they pave a smooth path to their future of total dominance.

The **Hiortros** espouse a different approach; that of open, zealous warfare. The most extremist Rosenthalists by far, their methodology from first principles is a simple desire and pursuit of eliminating an enemy. Through targeted strikes they destroy important assets belonging to the Fel-Arcad; fleets, outposts, space installations, even inhabited arcologies, all in the fervor of crusade. Hiring out their services to other unsavory groups in the Switchboard yields them economic resources and shaky alliances, but at their core, they are driven only by a need to scrub the stars of perceived heresy. Many, many parties in the Switchboard have declared the Hiortros an existential threat, even other Rosenthalist factions, but they set out on their mission with the full awareness and intent of making enemies.

The **Roslettes**, are a rather unique Rosenthalist faction. Rather than attacking the enemy from outside or dismantling them from within, the Roslettes seek to attain dominance of the Switchboard through a far more sinister means; ascension into something beyond the Third Kin. Believing the victory conditions sought by their siblings and cousins to ultimately change little about their ontology, the Roslettes have devised an entirely different stratagem, one based on consuming the very weave of the denizens of the Switchboard.

The Rosenthalists' creed and methods have thus earned them no small amount of ill repute among other denizens of the Switchboard. It is somewhat blackly debated in jest which faction of the Switchboard despises the Rosenthalists the most, with all discussion culminating in the concession that it is between the Nadiran Fel and the Vahnkin. The Vahnkin particularly despise the Rosenthalists as the Rosenthalists, particularly the Hiortros as they were the Antamaran Fel who fought the Vahnkin and the Vahn faithful in a bid to find a means to close the Void, believing that doing so would prevent - or at least postpone - a second refrain. While the Antamaran conflicts ultimately ended grossly in the Vahnkin's favor, it still stands that the Vahnkin hold mostly distaste towards the Fel-Arcad, and immense hostility towards the Rosenthalists. The Nadiran Fel differ from them in holding negative sentiment towards the Rosenthalists mostly on ideological grounds, as the superiority of any one peoples or faction over another or others is immensely incompatible with the Fel-Arcad's means of viewing the world and building societies within it.

The Lancaster maintain a sort of ambivalence towards the Rosenthalists, stemming from the Lancaster's most unfortunate placement with regards to their ability stride and weave - or lack thereof. The Rosenthalists view them as non-threatening to their causes, and some even view them as useful, taking advantage of the Lancaster's penchant for commerce and their overall social tolerability when compared to the Rosenthalists, putting them to task as an insulating membrane between them and the rest of the Dancirah.

Their disposition towards the Sil'khan, however, is rather noteworthy.

#### pNarrat: The Rosenthalists and the Sil'khan
The Rosenthalists harbor a fiery mix of both hatred and jealousy towards the Sil'khan, as to them, despite their formulation in the Triptych Crucible - a decidedly unnatural process - they are far, far more like the Danseers than the Rosenthalists. In addition to resenting the Sil'khan for merely existing, they resent the old Nadiran Fel for creating the Sil'khan, out of the belief that after the service the Danseers had tendered to all third kin and the Dancirah, and it would be an unspeakable loss for them to be wiped out by the curse inflicted by the Refrain.

To the Rosenthalists, their fellow Fel went out of their way to create a faction they would be subservient to as a matter of course, by virtue of the Rosenthalists own yardstick for measuring strength and prominence in the Switchboard; being like the Danseers. Had this not be done, had the Sil'khan not existed, the Rosenthalists as descendants of a Danseer would have assumed the post of superiority among all others among the stars. But the Fel in their benevolence bestowed the fading Danseers with an opportunity to descend and dwell in the Switchboard they had fought for, and for many Rosenthalists, this is the greatest sin of the Nadiran Fel of all.

The Sil'khan, however, have adopted varying dispositions towards the Rosenthalists, ranging from finding their indignance amusing, finding their fanaticism deplorable, and finding their methodology worrying. But for many Sil'khan, the Rosenthalists are simply beneath their notice. They simply exist with little care for the fact there exists a people that so violently despise them, for little reason other than the fact that any truly meaningful opposition the Rosenthalists could form against the Sil'khan would result in the Rosenthalists' own annihilation. 

This has not stopped many, many Rosenthalists from ages past concocting means to wipe out the Sil'khan, as they are convicted of the idea that if the Fel-Arcad brought them into these stars, then Fel-Arcad can take them out of them.

### The Weave-eaters
Let's talk about the Roslettes. They're vampires. Or, better put, my take on them.

At the crux of the Roslette's own brand of supremacist philosophy is that they are possessed not of innate superiority, but of the means to attain it. The Hiortros and Avarosi - despite difference in methodology - are entirely similar in outcome; that of subjugation of all unlike them. The Roslettes propose a different approach; that by becoming more than what one is, what still is will be brought lower than what has *become* as a matter of course. That one merely need only position themselves favorably in the calculus, and it will resolve according to their ends, rather than trying to force it to act as one wishes.

Their means of doing so is by exploiting a quirk with regards to Teks and the mechanics of descendance;

![[Birthing and Being#^1765ce]]

The Roslettes are possessed of a tek that has passed through their house from generation to generation, and careful, stringent enforcement of customs has kept this tek within mostly the hands of the Roslettes. This Tek is the power to **eat** and **assimilate** weave from other beings in the Switchboard, particularly the Five Straits found in the thinking weave. By doing so, they are able to harvest the information of their victims, add it unto themselves, and become more. 

In particular, the Roslettes seek out a specific woven backbone that dwells in all Third Kin, backbone weave that connects all kin to the **Old Danseers**. While the 'concentration' - of sorts - of this backbone-weave fades from generation to generation in the Third Kin as it is gradually overridden by the weave of the Great Families, there still remains flecks and shards of it in every Third Kin, and the Roslette's Tek of weave-eating allows them to rip this bit of weave from the lattices and straits of their victims, and stitch it into themselves. By gradually accumulating more and more of this Danseer weave, they in turn become more and more like the Old Danseers, inheriting their power - but more particularly - their 'post' in the Switchboard.

Their grand ambition is to thus **deceive the Astrolabe's calculus** into treating them like the Danseers, and in turn regularizing their current state to be reconciled with the strength the Danseers once bore. Their gambit is that by becoming more as Danseers from the very lattice, their ledgers will be treated as Danseer ledgers, and they will thus be elevated to the prominence the Danseers once wielded. Once this is achieved, it will simply be a matter of nature that they are beyond all other Third Kin, as this was how it was in the earliest days of the dawning chalkstrider era. It is less so the ushering in of a new era as it is a return to an old one, albeit with new faces on old thrones.

Because they need to seek out Danseer weave, the Roslettes have come to target the Sil'khan, the direct descendants of the Danseers as they died off following the Refrain, engineered into being by the Fel-Arcad of the time in a bid to preserve them even past the curse that purged them from the Switchboard. The Sil'khan have not been quiet about opposing this as well, and the both factions have been locked in overt and covert warfare for the longest while; the Roslettes seeking to ascend, and the Sil'khan fighting to preserve the memory and legacy of their ancestor-kin, which they see the Roslettes as working to defile.

Foreseeably, something of a culture arose around the Switchboard's weave-eaters, the amalgamation of a litany of themes ranging from the relationship with food and with others who they see as it, the nigh-religious fervor their charge invokes, the clandestine nature of their livings and doings, resigning themselves to only their own company, and the inevitable convolution of the weave-eating practice with the desires of flesh. Perceived by others in the Switchboard - even other Rosenthalist factions - they are a cult of debauchery and perversion, their only redeeming qualities being a firmness of conviction and the audacity to pursue their ends, something that - even then - is admired only in a vacuum, much as how one might admire the svelte majesty of a venomous snake, even though wholly aware of the suffering it brings.

How the Roslettes have come to operate varies. For one, their courts are possessed of truly unfathomable reclusion, so much so that there are many who even outrightly deny their existence. Much like the Avarosi, many Roslettes are fond of the clandestine, understanding that their charge and the means of fulfilling it are repulsive, but are still wholly unable of doing away with the need to pursue it. With the power to eat weave - having been morphed and shaped and honed over time - came the appetite for it, and even beyond the desire to ascend to the post of the Danseers comes a baser hunger to simply feed on weave in general. As such, they are terribly predisposed to acts of gruesome murder, being literal hunters of kin. Many are more so stalkers, choosing to be as covert as possible with their affairs, feeding when they can, killing only when they absolutely must, and working to minimize chances of detection and capture. Others are more monstrous and overt, cultivating superior prowess in both the physical and calcic to subjugate foes and devour them as they will. Many of these latter Roslettes work with the Hiortros in their campaigns, as the practice of eating weave yields boons beyond merely satisfying hunger.

This, however, is the means by which individual Roslettes operate, constrained by the reality of their being only person. Many Roslettes possessed of lofty ambitions and the drive to pursue them have contemplated and even executed mass operations to 'farm' and 'harvest' copious amounts of desirable weave from massive amounts of victims. Attempts to execute such against the Sil'khan have proven overwhelmingly unsuccessful, but their Fel-Arcad cousins - what with their colossal arcologies and overwhelming opposition to violence - have proven a sufficient target for the most daring and darkly of Roslettes, who have turned entire arcologies into feeding grounds. These **black arcologies** in turn become havens for all other manners of criminality, and serve as the many front desks for the Dancirah's underworld.

The result of weave-eating yielding a tangible increase in strength has resulted in a very elementary means of Roslette societal stratification; all hierarchies are dominated by the categorical strongest, and they must feed on weave to retain that post, as those below them are certainly eating weave to obtain the power necessary to depose them. Horizontal division at the top sees Roslettes divided into clans and dynasties, and vertical stratification sees these entities bearing those of high prominence, middling rank, and low regard. With strength being the major determinant of status, and the threat of destruction levied over every layer by the one above it, the social structure is one of immense stability. Miserable stability, but stability all the same. It is thus a major affair when these structures are upturned in one manner or another, either from outside aggressors or from within, and violent engagements ranging in scale from inter-family tussles to near-wars - often over nothing more than pride and standing - have led to perceptions of the Roslettes as immensely territorial and murderously snobbish. 

That being said, the zealous charge of ascension levied upon all Roslettes by the absolute highest in their society - those with a post analogous to a papal office in our world - greatly oppose overt violence *within* clans and courts between individual Roslettes, and outrightly forbid violence and overt conflict *between* clans and courts, out of - perhaps - an understanding that their charge is to eat and grow, rather than fight and diminish. There is the caveat however, that even this post is subject to changing leaders, and thus equally changing philosophies on how to go about their ascension, with some demanding they turn their fangs outwards to the rest of the Switchboard, towards greatly organizing and optimizing the task of consuming weave and ensuring as many as possible ascend to Danseer status - and others proposing instead that ascension is the privilege of a chosen few, and that these few are determined by a willingness to obtain strength for one's self and subjugate all others, including Roslette kin.

It is thus ripe grounds for perhaps the most prominent of Roslette social conventions and pastimes, their Culling Games. Either agreed upon by various clans and courts, or imposed upon multiple lower ones by a higher one, or periodically demanded by the highest Roslette office, grand festivals of culture and brutality are conducted in suitable Black Arcologies, as a means - primarily - to put on display the relative strength of the Roslettes as a people, and in turn to increase the average strength of the absolute strongest by culling those that represent their mathematical floor. Roslettes from all over gather at the venue, either out of compulsion to represent their house, the desire to test their mettle against others, zealotry in partaking of the ascension charge levied upon them, or to settle old grudges against other houses and individuals that will be participating. The format of this event varies, but the core principles of it remain the same from occasion to occasion; a celebration of strength, where many go in and few come out. It differs from other similar events in the Switchboard via having little by way of rules, and by being fundamentally a death game, and thus is attracts even non-Roslette observers from far and wide, who come to watch, gamble, make merry, revel in displays of weftcraft, scout potential talents, and any number of other more clandestine ambitions. Yet they are but mere observers, and the true purpose of the event remains an opportunity for Roslettes to revel in blood sport, and by doing so, gauge how much further and longer remains before their highest echelons attain their ranks as pseudo-Danseers. 

The Roslette Culling Games occupy an area of dubious legality with regards to greater Danciran law, as for one, questions of the illegality of the act, as well as black arcology jurisdiction, remain hotly debated. 

- Perhaps worth considering first is whether the actual principle of the Culling Games - or rather, the governing principle of the Roslettes, their desire to ascend via consumption of weave - is actually possible. This is of interest in particular to the Brass Monastics, who have appointed themselves as an investigative and managerial authority with regards to actions and phenomena that can or may have adverse, wide-spanning effects on the Switchboard. The return of the Danseers - but under entirely different, arguably adversarial principles - would be without question something they would work to prevent. However, there is no categorical proof that the Roslette's weave-eating could ever bring about this outcome. Considering the Brass Monastery is disinclined towards interfering with the affairs of the Third Kin otherwise, they thus turn something of a blind eye to the Culling Games, though under the note that should there ever be merit to the Roslette's method, their full might would be brought to bear against them. 

- Fel-Arcad arcology authorities are widely viewed as the ones who have a jurisdictional basis upon which to oppose the Culling Games, as the black arcologies they take place in are still treated as belonging to the Soleri that established them, though with the caveat that they have been taken over by hostile powers. For this reason, Fel-Arcad working alongside allied parties have opposed the events in the past, and have even fought to retake captured black arcologies, with varying success. Beyond this jurisdictional basis though, is their exercise of a moral one, where they oppose the Culling Games due to the elements of coercion of participants, and the fact participants fight to the death.

- The Sil'khan have the most complicated relationship with the Culling Games, as for one, the Roslettes have made themselves out to be predators of the Sil'khan, but for another, they being a proud and competitive people who love little more than the opportunity to participate in a no-holds-barred showcase of strength. As such, the Sil'khan are mostly torn, with the general disposition towards Roslettes ranging from distaste to outright hatred, but there being more nuance on whether one chooses to associate with them or not. For many Sil'khan, their own means of opposing the Roslettes is participating in their Games only to cull all of the strongest Roslettes participating, a lengthy joke with a brutal punchline. Many Sil'khan have come to see black arcologies as a necessary evil, as their value as an economic and logistical entity cannot be understated.

- The Lancasters and Vahnkin have little by way of interaction with the Roslettes, both bearing the least Danseer backbone weave, and thus regarded as already inferior to the Roslettes. Thrifty Lancasters however, often serve the Roslettes in exchange for various incentives, and particularly work as logistical go-betweens for getting interested parties into the Games, or moving Roslettes around in general. Much of Roslette society is in this way necessarily padded by layers of morally grey, coin-seeking Lancaster brethren, as they face zero risk of being consumed by the Roslettes, while in turn bearing little loyalty to the other Great Families, thus presenting little risk in return to the Roslettes. While their service does little to change the low regard held for the Lancasters by the Roslettes, the Lancasters are no strangers to such dispositions towards them, and the inequality of their post relative to the other Great Families has made them satisfied with very little.

- The Spyndl Academy similar to the Sil'khan has a complicated relationship with the Games and the Roslettes at large as well. For one, the Spyndl works for the preservation of the Third Kin, but mostly only on the macroscopic scale. Individual violence done by kin against kin is of greatly less concern than hypothetical threats against all Third Kin at large, and the Spyndl truly only harbors a sense of suspicion towards the Roslettes, born out of concern of whether they can truly become pseudo-Danseers. That being said, Spyndl covertly values the Culling Games as an excellent grounds to find new recruits, as their lack of rules and the brutality that stems from it as a consequence creates an excellent crucible for forming and refining truly powerful chalkweavers. Anywhere the Games are being conducted, there is sure to be a Spyndl agent in the crowd, watching the on goings and making notes of promising prospects.

However, the existence of those who are ambivalent towards - or even somewhat cooperative with - the Roslettes, doesn't change the fact that the vast majority of the Switchboard regards them as a murderous death cult, and there are individuals, orders and large bodies dedicated to hunting Roslettes wherever they can be found, with the end goal of wiping them from the face of the Dancirah. Only few are driven by a genuine fear of the possibility of their becoming Danseers, mostly simply hunt Roslettes because they present an undeniable threat to kin everywhere, and use the former point as a shield or justification of their cause. The Roslettes, naturally, have responded in kind, each side placing bounties on the heads of the others notables, while engaging in endless turf wars and assassination ping-pong all over the Dancirah. The necessarily clandestine operations of both sects, however, has made it impossible to determine which side is truly winning.

#### A Curse
The tek that confers the power of weave-eating has passed from generation to generation in the Roslettes, and as they have exercised its power and borne descendants, the weft of this tek has morphed and evolved in time, undergoing further sharpening and refinement towards achieving the ends it serves. This has in turn made the Roslettes increasingly powerful generation over generation, in the spheres of hunting and acquiring prospective victims, finding and tearing weave from their lattices, and integrating it into their own.

The weft-eating tek manifests as a major revision to the entire bodily plan and lattice of those that bear it, transforming them almost for the task of eating weft at hand. The tek's modifications can be categorized into three; **hunting**, **feeding** and **assimilation**.

Under **hunting**, the tek provides a list of various physiological improvements. Refinement of the senses, particularly that of the **weavesight** are foremost, granting one increased passive sensory prowess that is useful when stalking and taking down an opponent. Modifications to the lattice are undergone as well, with the apical and basal hardshell armor plating being thinned out and the motive framework made more proficient, sacrificing durability in exchange for strength and agility.

The more prominent and visual modification made by this tek, however, are alterations to the dentition and the nails of the hand. Structurally, the incisors in the teeth and the nails on the hand are lengthened, hardened and sharpened to dagger points, and are conferred with weft that allows them to tear wickedly through lattices. Calcically however, these modified bits of lattice additionally have lengths of the **computational strait** woven just under the material. By making direct lattice contact with the computational strait, weave-eaters are able to discern useful weave from chaff, and these sharpened teeth and claws allows for picking and pulling this desired weft even from living targets.

These modifications being visual, however, does have a number of social ramifications. Sharp teeth and nails are often tell-tale signs of a Roslette, and thus must be hidden when moving among peoples and in places that might be hostile to one. A common practice is filing down these protrusions. Roslettes who need to spend time among others often undergo this process, losing what makes them dangerous and in return being more able to mask their true nature. Being subject to the lattice's own reverse unravelling, they do eventually grow back with time, and some Roslettes with solid command of RUteks can regrow them nearly instantly as needed. Undergoing the loom at a sembleworks can additionally modify the lattice to make the fangs and claws **retractable**, enabling hiding them away when not in use. But for many Roslettes, their being visible and well-kept are a mark of pride, and - where it is not uniquely disadvantageous to present as a Roslette - they prefer to showcase their nature as a means of intimidating others. Roslettes of particularly perverse dispositions are known to work their fangs and claws with tools, the most common modification being chipping them to make them **serrated**, so as to inflict greater pain when used on victims.  

**Feeding** comes with modifications to the Five Straits, particularly that of the **interpreter strait**, removing one of the quirks of its function; rejection of weft that is parsed as not belonging to the owner. If a denizen of the Switchboard consumed the memory strait of another for example, they will primarily suffer from a colossal infusion of densely woven chalk that will wound them, but even after surviving this, the interpreter strait recognizes the weft as not originating from the owner, in a sense, and thus destroys and unravels it into regular ribbon chalk. Denizens of the Switchboard can thus not 'eat' another's head and gain access to their memories; all denizens except the Roslettes. Weave-eating disables this function of the interpreter, and allows them to feed on foreign weft with little consequence - when done properly, as elaborated upon later. Eaten weft passes through the interpreter with its integrity maintained, and is handed off to the tek on the computational strait for processing, or **assimilation**, rather.

**Assimilation** precedes the Roslette's goal of ascension. Eaten weave goes to the computational strait, where the weave-eating tek discerns between kinds of weft, threshes the wheat from the chaff, and passes it to the appropriate parts of the lattice. The most desirable weave - Danseer backbone - is harvested from the spines of third kin subjects and passed to the Roslette's own backbone, where the tek invokes the lattice's own reverse unravelling to integrate this new backbone with the preexisting one, and the addition of Danseer weave permeates throughout the lattice and straits, inducing a tangible strengthening in their function. How well this process is done varies from Roslette to Roslette, with newer generations being more proficient than older ones, and younger members of one generation being more proficient than elder ones.

Wherein the power to consume weave becomes a curse, however, is the hunger. The ability to consume weave comes also with a hunger to do so, and even Roslettes who have no intent of chasing the post of a Danseer are still stricken with the desire to feed on the lattices of others. As such, even beyond the ascension charge, Roslettes are obligated to feed to maintain the wellbeing of their own persons, as - if this hunger is not attended to - the weave-eating tek will turn the lattice against itself, and begin an excruciating  process of internal self-cannibalization. One cannot cheat this hunger either by simply eating any odd weave available; the tek creates a hunger for complex weft, and unfortunately, the most readily available complex weft is that of the memory and computational straits.

This does come with a number of problems, however.

The interpreter strait, as explained above, actively filters out certain permutations of weave that are parsed as not originating from a given subject. The weave-eating tek disables this function, and additionally facilitates the assimilation of consumed weave into the lattice. For weave such as familial backbones, this results in imbibing the nature of the origin of that backbone, and becoming more like that family. For memory straits however, a Roslette can indeed consume the memories of a subject and imbibe them as their own, integrating them into their own memories, akin to stuffing papers in a book and treating that book - additions and all - as though it were a single cohesive unit. This does come with the problem of breaks in continuity however, as a Roslette that frequently eats the memories of others will in turn become a living chronicle born of half-remembered tales, many of them not their own. 

The irreconcilability of one's own memories and the memories of others on the fronts of temporal placement, content and context has cursed the Roslettes to suffer from a strange form of 'collective identarian impermanence', where individual Roslettes have only fleeting ideas of what they are, and the Roslettes as a whole suffer from an inability to identify oneself with respect to the identities of others. Roslette houses and clans and courts constantly collapse and emerge - not from starvation or strife - but from their members simply forgetting that they were a member of such a thing, and it has become essential to keep extensive written records of nearly anything of note, as any thing stored in the mind and passed on by word of mouth, never once being committed to anything more solid, is at nontrivial risk of simply ceasing to exist in the collective Roslette consciousness. This problem is dealt with in part via the maintenance of extensive  records of knowledge and lineages, and referring back to them to refresh oneself of information deemed important enough to store. However, this produces two more issues in turn; the first being that the existence of a central record of what is 'true' that is also not unmodifiable is simply begging for someone possessed of a sufficient blend of intelligence, intent, ambition and drive to functionally rewrite history as they see fit, in a bid that quite literally shapes the future. The second problem is more philosophical, that being that as Roslettes eat, they lose more and more of themselves, and what is restored to them are only the basest principles of the necessity of further eating. Even the Roslettes, as perverted, maleficent and fanatical as they are, are capable of moments of warmth, joy and bliss. These moments, few and far-between, are treasured by their kind, but they are in turn among the first to go when a Roslette has fed too greatly in their time, and the void left behind is filled only with memories that were never theirs - making them yearn even more strongly for the ones that were - and a renewed hunger that must be satiated. 

Eating the computational strait of a subject results in a noteworthy occurrence, the passing on of Teks. The weave-eating Tek occupies little room on the memory and computational straits, and thus it is common practice for Roslettes to wield a second tek in addition to the power to eat weave, this secondary tek usually being obtained by prying it from the carcass of something they've preyed upon. Eating the computational strait itself does additionally yield the various fold equations that were written upon it, and thus grants the consumer an explosive boost in chalkweaving potential. 

For many Roslettes, this is their path to power, eating the strong and growing stronger, and coupled with the effect eating has on their memory, the Roslettes could be said to be totally, utterly cursed with a charge that demands them to exchange their selves - what they are - to become something else.
