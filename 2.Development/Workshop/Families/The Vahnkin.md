> ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

Vahnkin follow a set of naming paradigms; collections of letters that form 'affixes', which indicate gender and placement in Conclavic hierarchy. 

1. Gendering
Typically, the 'vah' affix is used in masculine applications, and 'vel' used in feminine ones, with 'vyn' used when the subject isn't keen on the others, or as chosen. 

Examples; Vahwel, Velskeer, Vynsahd.

Additionally, they need not be in the beginning of names.

Examples; Talovah, Hevelsa, Sorrvyn.

'Vah' and 'vel' are typically used by those who desire the stress the gendering of their bearer of the names. Many vahnkin use the far more diverse selection of ungendered affixes. While 'vyn' is the most common, more such as 'veh', 'vin' and 'var' exist. 

Of cultural note is that affixes that posses an 'a' lean towards masculine, with 'e' leaning towards feminine. 

2. Conclavic Hierarchy
Members of the Conclave serving in ministerial roles have their names modified as well. Enclaven take on the 'vahn' affix in masculine cases, 'veln' in feminine ones, and 'vyjn' (pronounced vy-JIN) where specificity is not desired. In higher ranks of the hierarchy, 'vahan', 'velen' and 'vyiny' are employed.

Examples (for lesser); Arvahn, Velnah, Lehrvyjn.
Examples (for greater); Covahan, Xevelene, Vyinymir.

3. Sect
Affixes for either the Nugatory or Avarice sects exist. 

Members of Avarice take affixes derived from words evoking wealth, greed, pursuit and royalty.

An example is 'luc' or 'lucre' as used for Lucrecia.
- 'Luc' from lucre.
- 'Ava' from avarice.
- 'Cov' from covetous.
- 'Mat' from materialism.
- 'Vor' from voracity.

	Incomplete; expand.

4. Last Names
Last names are typically derived from either the name or modification of a name held by an ancestor, or a fixed last name if the bearer is descended from an Enclaven.

For descendants of Enclaven, Vanitas, Velspar or Vynor is used depending on the gender ascribed to be the ancestor. 

5. Amaranth
Vahnkin taking on the Amaranth headdress take the title of **Sultan**, **Shaltanah** or **Saltah** for masculine, feminine and non-specific.
