## Legacy
### Legacy Law
#### Fel-Arcad Law
Each arcology has their individual laws, built off of the baseline law established in the Fey Curlicue. This baseline law is compiled from the **Farsee**, the **Annals of the Eight**, and **Mouths**, that outline respectively how arcologies should operate, how individual and groups of Fel-Arcad should behave and relate, and the relationship they should have towards violence. Upon this foundation, appendum and amendments are added by individual arcologies as is needed. These combine to form the **Arcal**, the collation of all an arcology's law.

#### Crime & Punishment
> Build the Fel-Arcad government and court/legal system.

Criminal law among the Fel-Arcad is handled by their (legisjudiciary PHldr.) that is responsible for both proposing, drafting, deliberation upon, enacting and interpretation of arcology law as well as enforcement of it. These laws are written into an arcology's Arcal, the binding document of rules that all within the arcology are beheld to.

Necessary investigations and eventual punishment are handled by the Sekators, the only Fel-Arcad empowered to use violence by virtue of being specifically trained in its just application. Actual judicial proceedings are handled by the LJ.

> Following sections are somewhat tentative.

Fel-Arcad courts are somewhat familiar affairs with judges, defendants, prosecutors and a jury. Though as a point of difference, juries in one arcology are drawn from other arcologies, and it is common practice for one arcology to request for jurors from another. 

> This has been changed, and is part of a much larger redesign of how Fel-Arcad courts work. They feature triple juries, one consisting of Fel-Arcad drawn from the arcology where the incident in question took place, one consisting of Fel-Arcad drawn from other arcologies (often just one or two) and one consisting of non Fel-Arcad, meant to provide a non-Fel, outside perspective on the matter. 

Most punishments given down by Fel-Arcad courts are tempered by the fact the Fel are a philosophically-mandated pacifistic people, and thus many would consider their punishments 'soft'. Financial penalties such as fines or reductions in monetary allotments, uncompensated work, restriction of freedoms within the arcology such as access to various facilities, temporary exile - or in the worst cases - permanent exile, encompasses the majority of punishment methods afforded to the Fel-Arcad. Many families and groups within and outside of the Fel-Arcad have criticized the Fel-Arcad as 'too lenient', met with counterarguments in the form of mentioning how most 'harsher' methods are incompatible with their doctrine.

This has led to many instances of slighted Fel-Arcad who felt the punishment dealt to their offenders didn't nearly match the gravity of the offence committed, and they may be driven to seek recourse on their own terms, enacting a personal brand of justice. Exiles from an arcology may find themselves being pursued, either by their former victims who choose self-imposed exile or sneaking out of the arcology to hunt them down, or hired hands to keep their own hands clean. Feljourn in particular are invaluable for this task, their shifted, hardened perspectives shaped by living in the star-wilds makes them intrinsically understanding of seeking justice one's own way.

There are of course arcologies that embrace harsher methods of punishment, including imprisonment and occasionally even the death penalty, obtaining a mixed - but mostly disapproving - reception, by the wider Fel-Arcad community. Studies naturally exist for either side of this divide, arguing for one method over the other. Rosenthalists in particular favor harsher approaches.

#### Jurisdiction Within the Dancirah
The jurisdiction of an arcology is often a point of contention. Generally, it is accepted that the jurisdiction of an arcology ends at the physical end of the arcadia it is situated within, a boundary between legally-bound space and the unclaimed waters that remains fairly static as arcadias are often programmed to stop growing once a desired size is reached.

Fel-Arcad generally make it a point not to punish offenders for crimes against them if those offenders are not subject to arcology jurisdiction. A crime committed by a non-Fel against a Fel-Arcad within the bounds of arcology space is handled by that arcology, and punishment is meted out to the offender by the arcology's administration due to the fact visiting an arcology is done with the awareness and thus acceptance of being bound by arcology law. 

Offences committed outside an arcology's jurisdiction against a member of that arcology are handled somewhat differently. Investigations are carried out to find the nature of the offence and the perpetrators, and then this information is passed over the arcology's External Affairs. EA contacts relevant parties that the perpetrator is subject too - such as another arcology in the case of a Fel-Arcad offender - and issues their demands regarding a desire for punishment and the degree of severity in its dispensation. Noncompliance is met with sanctions from the Fel-Arcad, often in the form of trade refusal by the relevant arcology and other arcologies that feel so inclined. The economic value of the Fel-Arcad sees that their demands are often answered sooner rather than later.

## #08 Rituals and Periodicals
Yes, there are numerous written materials and academic studies that explore the relationship between conflict and the creation or evolution of cultures. Here are a few examples:

1. **"The Art of War" by Sun Tzu**: This ancient Chinese military treatise, written by Sun Tzu, discusses strategies and tactics for warfare. It has influenced not only military thought but also aspects of Chinese culture and philosophy.

2. **"Culture and Conflict Resolution" edited by Kevin Avruch, Peter W. Black, and Joseph A. Scimecca**: This book explores how culture shapes conflict resolution processes and outcomes. It examines case studies from various regions and cultural contexts to illustrate the complex interplay between culture, conflict, and peacebuilding.

3. **"Violence and Social Orders: A Conceptual Framework for Interpreting Recorded Human History" by Douglass C. North, John Joseph Wallis, and Barry R. Weingast**: This book provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the role of violence and conflict in shaping social orders throughout history. It examines how institutions, including cultural norms and beliefs, emerge in response to conflicts over power and resources.

4. **"Cultures of War: Pearl Harbor/Hiroshima/9-11/Iraq" by John W. Dower**: This book explores the cultural dimensions of war and conflict through the lens of four significant historical events: the attack on Pearl Harbor, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the September 11 attacks, and the Iraq War. It analyzes how these events have shaped national identities, narratives, and memory.

5. **"Blood and Belonging: Journeys into the New Nationalism" by Michael Ignatieff**: In this book, Ignatieff examines the relationship between nationalism, identity, and conflict in the context of post-Cold War geopolitics. He explores how conflicts over ethnicity, religion, and territory contribute to the formation of national identities and cultural boundaries.

6. **"Cultural Anthropology: Global Forces, Local Lives" by Jack David Eller**: This textbook provides an overview of cultural anthropology, including discussions on the role of conflict and globalization in shaping cultural diversity. It examines how conflicts over resources, power, and ideology influence cultural practices, identities, and social change.

These are just a few examples, and there is a vast array of literature and scholarly research available on the topic of conflict and its impact on the formation, evolution, and resilience of cultures around the world.
