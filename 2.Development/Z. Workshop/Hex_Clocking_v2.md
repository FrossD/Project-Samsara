Let's look at the macroscopic description of clocking and try to come up with a microscopic cause. Clocking can:
- increase or decrease the rate of a repeated event
- *create* repeated events out of single events
- scramble perceived variables, making them different from actual variables (???)
The third power clearly doesn't fit with the other two. Cryo describes that "location" can be clocked, making a clocker untraceable, but it's not clear how this works. The actual physical location of the clocker isn't being manipulated. Does this only affected "devices" that would read the clocker's position? What kinds of devices? The human eye after all is nothing more than a "device", it runs on physics like anything else. If physics is being manipulated, we need to know exactly what physics and how.

Let's focus on the first two powers then. An event can be made to happen again, and we can control how fast repeated events happen.

First, we need to clarify what "event" here means. In the spirit of creativity, I'll start with one idea and run with it, then backtrack if necessary...

An "event" should first refer to a group of particles. In particular, it is an equation of motion for those particles. So somehow we create conditions where the grouping of particles returns to the "state" their were in before.

Okay, we need to define "state". I suppose that a state is the value of a set of variables describing those particles at any given moment in time. This might be the positions of all the particles, the temperature of the group of particles, etc. States are assigned values in *time*, and we want them to "cylce" or "loop" somehow.


## Closed Timelike Curves
Close timelike curves are a phenomenon in general relativity (which relates to Switchboard information curvature). A CTC is essentially a *pathway* in spacetime that comes back to its starting point: not in space, but in time. We need to take this idea and adjust it for our needs.

What I want to avoid is time travel, which come to think of it is what a closed timelike curve is about. It is a region of space-time whose curvature allows an object traversing through to return to an earlier point in time, though at a different point in space.

This is close to, but not quite what we want.

## Closed Spacelike Curves

A closed spacelike curve is something like the vice versa of a closed timelike curve. Rather than a pathway through curvature that returns you to an previous point in time at a different point in space, a CSC takes you to the same point in space, at a different point in time.

In other words, our CSC would cause an object to essentially *orbit* - the object keeps returning to the same point in space. We might say that its *location* is looped. The key here, I think, is that we are not talking about manipulating a property of *objects*, but rather we are manipulating the *spacetime* they reside in.

But now we get into interesting territory. *Space*time implies that objects specifically return to the same *position* that they were in before. What we want is for an object to return to the same *property in general* that it had before.

Closed configuration-space curves?
Closed.... *information* curves.

## Closed information curves

A closed information curve warps not space, not time, but rather *information content itself*.  Information is the currency of the switchboard, curvature is how information flows are manipulated. If curvature "curves in on itself", information flows return to previous configurations. In other words, you can loop properties of an object.

As a concrete example, consider a basket with some apples in it. We then create a closed information curve: a region of spacetime where the property "number of apples" is looped. If something enters the region with 10 apples, then it must exit the region with 10 apples. As long as the basket remains in the region, the "number of apples" property must return to a previous state.

Closed info curves immediately gives us some hard constraints on what we can do. For example, the information complexity of an individual, a person, is absolutely vast. You couldn't return an entire person to a previous state without completely simulating every aspect of their being. You'd have to effectively store a copy of their entire personhood data, and *then* create an infoloop that would move each piece of information into the correct place. Nigh impossible.

An easier construct would be something like a woodchipper - organized information comes in, randomized information comes out. In fact, we already know how to do this - a blast of raw chalk with enough power behind it starts to overwrite a Strider's data.

Infoloops are thus delicate structures, like a spiderweb. They carefully route pieces of information in loops. Tightening the loops causes shorter router, loosening the loops causes a longer route - controlling the rate at which things loop. It is a subtle and highly complex art, because one needs to dent spacetime in precise ways, forming a complex graph (in the mathematical sense - see "graph theory") of carefully chosen dips, bends, and hills.

Maintaining an infoloop requires energy, and the energy scales with the information density one manipulates. Consider the conservation of energy problem of *Portal*. I place one portal on the floor, another directly above it on the ceiling. If I drop a ball through the portal, the ball will fall and accelerate, getting faster and faster infinitely. This breaks conservation of energy...

...*unless* there's an energy cost to transporting an object through the portal. The more mass-energy that object has, the greater the cost of transporting it. This would (I think) negate any gain in energy of the object itself.

Infoloops are similar. If an object enters an infoloop, the creator of that infoloop must keep the loop intact while the object traverses the web. Objects that are too "large" (that have too great an information density) will damage the web if the Clocker is not strong enough to maintain it. You could try imprisoning another person in one of these loops, but it'd be something like trying to catch a bear in a spiderweb (subject to tuning by authorial powers).

A nice feature of infoloops is that the infoloop might only target a specific kind of information, and it might be only vaguely specified. For example, you might loop the color of an object, but only within a certain range. The narrower the range of color you wish to restrict the loop to, the tighter and narrower the channels of your infoloop web must be. Conversely, the wider the range of acceptable color, the looser and more flexible the web is.

A more complex (but not *fully* specified loop) might search for a *generic* heart (as opposed to a specific person's heart), and constrict the natural looping of that heart. This would mean that any person that walks through that region experiences an increase in heartrate. If that person is a Strider, and recognizes the power acting on them, they can attempt to break the web, and restore their heartrate (again, subject to authorial powers).
