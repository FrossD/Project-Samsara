# Glass
> Glass 4.0 inbound. 

Glass is a physical phenomena in the Switchboard that manifests as jagged, crystalline translucent solid that passively diffracts light passing through it, giving it the appearance of brilliant-cut gemstones - particularly diamond. It originates from the Vitric Shelf above the Switchboard, and while little about it is understood, what *is* understood is the manner in which it interacts with chalk.

Glass' most noteworthy property is that chalk cannot abide it. It is caustic to chalk in all forms. Dust chalk outrightly explodes in its presence. Crystalline chalk loses all structural integrity, collapsing in upon itself. Ribbon chalk in particular, is destroyed utterly under the influence of Glass. It catches and frays it, ripping, tearing and gouging into it, shredding it by mere contact. Lattices upon contact with Glass, aren't so much unwound as they are turned to tatters. And the Glass then parasitically feeds upon the Chalk it consumes, using it to propagate more of itself. A single sliver of Glass can devour swathes of Chalk, replacing an entire landscape with chromatic, crystalline juts of lacerating negentropy.  ^cfe87b

Glass originates from nowhere other than the Vitric Shelf, a realm above the Great Sky where it constitutes the primary material, taking the place of any other conceivable substance. 

## Origin, The Vitric Shelf
![[The Vitric Shelf#^371924]]

## Negentropy
Glass in the Switchboard is a **negentropic** force. Chalk - which in many manners is representative of chaos and complexity - is simplified down and regularized in the presence of Glass. Glass attacks the complex, chaotic nature of lattices and dismantles them down by opposing the very complexity that is essential for their operation. It opposes entropy. 

It prompts the question then of why Glass does not dismantle any and all things made of chalk, and why it has seemingly such a hunger for the lattices of Striders and Weavers over Grounded. Glass does not abide entropy - **to an extent**. Glass has a sort of '**negentropy threshold**' built into it, such that certain things are regularized down to a point and no further. This threshold is **altered by factors** such as the '**purity**' of the Glass, such that there is in fact a **means to create Glass that cannot abide chalk in any form whatsoever, and Glass that acts more 'mildly' towards chalk**. Most Glass that is encountered, as such, will have little effect on inanimate objects such as rocks and trees, as well as the lattices of the Grounded. The Strider and Weave Protocols however, introduce such immense amounts of entropy to a given lattice that Glass aggressively attacks and regularizes it. ^ab6fc2

## Calciphagy
Glass feeds on chalk, destroying it and creating more Glass. The Vitric Shelf does this on a considerably larger scale; the jaws may very well be actual jaws, colossal mouths that chalkweaver researches have observed to be actively feeding on the vast swathes of Chalk moving through the Switchboard. Beside planets, near Vaults, in cradles near Wellsprings and armillary stars, a glass-filled maw of teeth is almost always somewhat nearby, steadily feeding on the Chalk in the intra-planetary Sky.

Most worryingly however, is that it is suspected the jaws to the Vitric Shelf actively prey upon the [[The Doctrine of Passing#The Current|Current]], the physical manifestation of the philosophy stemming from the knowledge that the chalk of the Switchboard is ancient, existing in a cycle of amalgamating at the birth of a new weaver, and dissipating back into it at their death. This chalk carries with it the legacy of the deceased Strider, which it bestows upon the next lucky enough to born with it.

The Shelf presents a problem with this, in that the previously-thought closed loop of the Current - in fact - suffers from a leak. Chalk is lost to the Shelf, devoured, and turned to Glass, and as the amount of Glass grows, so does its apparent hunger. The Switchboard has no mechanism for creating armillary stars, neither is there a means to accelerate the production of chalk by those armillary stars, and it leads many to postulate that the entire Switchboard exists in a negative-sum game; that it is actively losing chalk that cannot be replaced. But they are also led to conclude that this will not be a major problem for many, many processions.

A more immediate problem however, is that the action of the glass jaws are actively robbing the Current of the boons meant to be passed to Striders.

> And the narrative consequence of this is a generation of Striders considerably weaker than the last, peppered with dregs from the generation before them that just about barely survived the Mysticism.

The loss of these boons produce a subtle but present dampening effect on the overall strength of Striders throughout the Switchboard.

## Vitreodynamics
As always, despite their limited understanding of it, Striders have found various ways to use and interact with Glass. Most notable of these is the Slate's Breach Protocol and the DevitNet as a whole, but a much larger application has been in the case of the **Panopticon**; a former vault turned into a complex for housing imprisoned Striders. A final note is on Glass as a weapon, particularly as employed by the Grounded as an equalizer in altercations with chalkweavers. And it rather curiously find itself being used as a medical aid in some means as well.

### The DevitNet
> This section is thrashed more thoroughly in [[Communications and Compute]].

The Anarhiza spreads its roots upwards the Vitric Shelf, and forms a network with all other Anarhiza in the Switchboard that are linked to each other's roots. Through this net, Striders are able to utilize their Slates to pass information across the Switchboard. This structure forms the 'DevitNet'. The encasement of the Anarhiza roots in the Glass around it forms a sort of fiber-optics analogue known as **glasswire**, facilitating the transmission of messages.

The application of Glass here, however, is in isolating networks. Switchboard Vaults and even Strider creations can have a 'Glasswall' deployed physically around their root networks, by sending an unfolded chalk construct in ribbon form down the roots of the Anarhiza, that refolds itself and severs the root at that point, Glass filling the gap. Repeatedly doing this can ensure that information only has one physical inlet and outlet in the network, facilitating secure containment. Vault Minds do this as their vaults arise, their network necessary for coordinating the defenses of the vault.

Strider Glassbreakers on Kache Krashing operations must breach this Glasswall using their Slate's Breach Protocol, which functions by accessing the DevitNet while near the vault, and searching for severed ends that might be those cut by the Vault Mind, before then deploying the Breach Protocol. The Breach Protocol's various tools are means of interacting with Glass, most notable of them being the '**PRISMpick**', a tool designed to self-destructively break through Glass via amassing and expending large amounts of Chalk. Similar to the vaults, the Breach Protocol can also be used against Strider-built isolated networks, to deadly efficacy. 

### The Panopticon
A truly bizarre creation, the Panopticon was formerly a Vault in the Switchboard situated near a gaping jaw to the Vitric Shelf. The vault was krashed and Striders began a litany of experiments with it, due to the nature of one of its defenses; a seemingly infinite labyrinth of cell-like rooms that to many, would prove inescapable. As their experimentation generated massive quantities of information and created a considerable amount of calcic activity, the nearby jaw grew towards it, and aimed to swallow the vault whole. However, it proved unable to do so, resulting in the jaw jammed shut with the structure, but the vault itself now straddling the divide between the Sky and the Vitric Shelf. ^6c845b

Narratively, the Academy seized control over it and now use it as a prison. Through the power of a reprogrammed Vault Mind, they are able to move components - walls, floors, ceilings, entire rooms, collections of them - around individually, allowing them to encase imprisoned Striders in cocoons of Glass. Escape is - theoretically - impossible. 

In addition to these Glass cells is the vigil of the Panopticon's warden; **Panoptes**, a reprogrammed Vault Mind, capable of observing the entirety of the complex through bouncing reflections off of the Glass in the Vault. Considering its sheer scale, complexity and use, the Panopticon is classified as a [[SB_Astromechanics#Non-Planetary Structures|non-planetary structure]].

### Anti-Strider Warfare
Without much debate, an altercation between a Strider and/or Chalkweaver and a Grounded is incredibly one-sided. The Grounded are not able to weave chalk, use Teks or perform rituals, and though they could wield a relic designed to operate off of an internal supply or latent chalk in the vicinity, they will never be able to bring out its full potential. Esoteric powers such as the Flash Protocol, titular powers and all forms of Depthstriding - without having been taught - are additionally beyond them. It would wholly logical then, to say that the Grounded have no means to oppose wielders of chalk.

However, the Grounded - in lacking the chalkweavers' strengths - do not possess their weaknesses as well. The Grounded are not afflicted with starblight, vulnerable to Depthstrider's pull - and most of all - immune to the destructive influence of Glass.

As such, Glass grants a means for the Grounded to oppose Striders in combat. Glass in various forms - delivered by bullet, formed into a blade, shaped into a shield, nearly anything imaginable - constitutes a potent weapon against a Chalkweaver.

	Narratively, it is largely used by the Lancastars; a family almost entirely made of the Grounded. Glass grants them a maens to oppose the wider Strider world, and earn them places in the wider Switchboard society.

### Legacy: Instrument Six
A holdover from earlier iterations of Glass, the Instrument Six is a specially-designed anti-Strider weapon employed to deal with the Mystics during the height of the Mysticism crisis. Due to the Mystics' immense power, conventional engagement methods proved ineffective, and so new approaches needed to be taken.

Taking the form of hypodermic syringe or bullet, a measure of prepared Glass encased in a calcic 'artifact' that directs the payload, the Glass can be delivered in a manner that - in an overwhelming number of cases - attacks solely the Strider Protocol while leaving the Strider unharmed otherwise. It proved very effective, and was one of the many prongs on the fork that finally took down the Mystics.

Variants of it were created;
1. **I-6As**, which only temporarily suppresses the ability to Stride. It is widely used and regarded as an underhanded method to gain an upper-hand in a fight.
2. **I-6Ds** or '**sixties**', the actual military grade iteration of it, locking down the ability to Stride to facilitate suppression and capture. However, it's effects can be undone using various methods. For every ritual there are counter rituals.
3. **I-6Rs**; '**rulebreakers**', an iteration designed to attack the Strider Protocol of victims as well as the Mysticism itself. It ultimately led to the downfall of the Mystics.
4. **I-6Es**; '**executioners**', issued by justice systems as a punitive measure, and cannot be undone. It irreversibly destroys the Strider Protocol, and makes those inflicted with it, 'Slow'.

The existence of I-6 drives endless conflict across the Switchboard, as they are the simplest way to defeat a Strider. Despite them being outlawed and open production ceasing after the Mysticism crisis, underground manufacturers and black markets continue their production and distribution. Striders themselves occasionally carry some of it themselves, as a last resort.

### 'Taking the Glass'
A consequence of the Switchboard and the tangible nature of information is that, occasionally, Striders are opposed to pain and suffering that strikes far deeper than it would normally as it might attack their doctrinal core or some other principle upon which they and their powers are reliant. A method of alleviating this pain is a carefully prepared measure of Glass, designed to 'dull the edge' of what is being felt.

Glass' ability to destroy chalk can be used most curiously to attack the memory line of a Strider's Five Straits, and alter the memories of the Strider stored within. Traumatic events can simply be erased, or modified such that terrible outcomes can be lessened. This is known as 'taking the Glass.'

It was used extensively in the aftermath of the Mysticism, in a bid to treat Striders returning from the various battlefronts of the cognitohazards the Mystics exposed them too, and the terrible events they themselves saw happen on the fronts. Particularly, it was used to treat those who had lost their ability to Stride to the Mystic's powers, who - it was found - became immensely suicidal once they realized they could no longer traverse the skies again.

Inevitably, it saw use as both a recreational drug and a weapon. Glass could be used - unbeknownst to the victim - to erase their memories and other information they may hold, such as causing them to outrightly forget ritual schema or how to use their weapons. As a drug, it inflicts a general deadening effect on the psyche, inducing feelings described as 'euphoric apathy'. When combined with chalk, it is possible to create minor vacuums in the mind and fill them with thoughts and feelings fabricated by woven chalk, able to be administered by smoking the powdered mixture or other methods. These thoughts and memories could be the experiences of other Striders, or entirely artificial ones that allowed the subject to experience - if at the mercy of a skilled weaver of such things - whatever they so choose.
