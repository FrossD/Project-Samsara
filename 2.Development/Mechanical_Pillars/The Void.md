# The Void
## Preamble
As described extensively in [[SB_Astromechanics]], the Switchboard is a vast space filled with ever-bright armillary stars, the ancient planets, and the cradles that birth them, as well as the innumerable smaller points of interest and phenomena that dot it. However, lurking between - and yet under - the mighty sky is a yet mightier deep, lurking just out of sight by means of physics. It's nature pulls all information towards it, and this pull affects the Switchboard that rests above it. It is an existence of both unmatched power and treachery.

It is called the Deep, the Challenger Dark; the Void.

The Void is multifaceted in nature, and we will analyze all of these facets in turn, beginning with the nature of the Void as a location, and the qualities it possesses that gives it it's distinct, esoteric nature. From there we go into the Void as a Power (and under this, the Depthstride and Depthstrider combat), the Void as a Being, and then the Void as a Philosophy. 

## The Void as a Location: Grand Mechanics
**The Shape of the Void**
The Void possess a global curvature that grants it its shape, and this curvature dictates what can occupy the Void, as well path taken when passing through it. The global curvature additionally slows down anything attempting to pass through it, via its effect of global deceleration, which exists as a result of it's curvature. 

The presence of Information induces information density, which further warps the Void but a considerably smaller scale, causing 'local curvature', and the Void itself warps and bends on smaller scales - relative to the global scale - causing flux storms ([[SB_Astromechanics]]). Throwing an object out into interplanetary space should result in consistent deceleration then, but due to small dips, dings, curves and bends along the way, it is not so.

**The Depth of the Void**
Independent of the Void's behavior in three-dimensional space is it's depth in the fourth dimension, functioning as a massive cave system or the rest of a waterbody below the serene, flat surface. 

	It additionally explains a plothole of why objects with zero momentum (such as armillary stars) don't fall into the Void, but are rather seemingly affixed in place. It is due to the shallowness of the Void at that specific region, ignoring the curvature.

A base depth of Void needs establishing. A Void a kilometer deep at it's shallowest allows neutron stars to be somewhat above 'v-level'. A Strider however, is not a kilometer tall and so falling even into impossibly shallow Void means loss to the Challenger Dark. This is why the Strider Protocol is essential; it allows moving too fast - much like a stone skipped across water - to fall into the Void.

The imperfect nature of the Void can also be exploited by particularly proficient Striders to perform deft maneuvers during the Stride, described best as skipping a stone to reach the edge of a whirlpool, bending it from it's initial path to reach another shore. Exploitation of these kinks in the

## The Void as a Power
### The Depthstride
The Depthstride works on the principle of *negative information.*

The Void has natural curvature, but the presence of information creates information density, which produces additional curvature. The Void necessarily has it's own 'gravity', which can be interpreted as further curvature along a fourth dimension, except thoroughly uniform. Thus, escaping the Void requires 'falling upwards', but this simply isn't possible due to the Void's curvature.

However, if information produces density which produces curvature, then it follows that *negative information* can produce *negative information density*, which expectedly results in *negative curvature*, which cancels out existing curvature, and allows escaping the pull of the Void. Thus, traversing the Void requires the creation of negative information. Negative information grants the power to unbend space, and with bending and unbending working in tandem, you are granted the power to Depthstride.

	The problem now is what negative information even is, in-universe.

Those who lack the Strider Protocol are able to learn Depthstriding. Unlike the Strider Protocol which is [[Birthing and Being#Hereditary Protocols|hereditary]], the Depthstride can be taught, and learning to conjure negative information and manipulate spatial curvature grants access to the rest of the powers available to wielders of the Void. Learning the Depthstride - however - 'locks' you out of using calcic or chalk-based powers, such as the Weave Protocol, Teks and Rituals. 

	That said, mechanisms exist to allow an amount of overlap between Chalk and Depth Striders. Chalkstriders can use some of the unique horticulture found in the Challenger Dark for their rituals, while Depthstriders can wield chalk-reliant implements such as relic and Slates, though with expectedly reduced proficiency.

#### The Depthstride vs. The Strider Protocol
While the Strider Protocol functions by amassing Chalk and flaring it as forward propulsion, the Depthstride functions by inducing localized curvature to produce forward movement. This however means that users of the Strider Protocol are susceptible to the nature of the media they are travelling through. The curvature of the Void gradually decelerates the Stride, and it is the speed of the Stride that prevents striders from being lost to the depths of the void. Depthstriders can simply induce anti-curvature and move across pockets of Void without issue. 

> As a narrative point, early Chalkstriders with no knowledge of the Void could have assumed that interplanetary space possessed something akin to 'air-resistance' that slowed down the Stride, produced by some unknown fluid. This was the case until an Einstein-analogue came up with a more complete description of mechanics by somehow measuring the Void. Historically this was done by measuring the curvature of light from a star 'around the sun' (ask Hex for clarification) during an eclipse. Similar thing can be done (leaning towards 'should be done') with information flow.

> As a further side note, this is a very workable way to introduce Vahn as a character in mythos, as the arrival of someone from functionally, down under, radically shakes up known science, prompting new inquiry.

### To Give and To Take
The nigh infinite depths of the Void present both treachery and spoils to all those ready to plumb its depths. To obtain the bounty of the Void, however, requires Knowing the means of doing so. One can query the Void, and their inquiry takes on some of their will and intent, exchanging it with the Void for what is desired. This the power of **Giving**. Some things cannot be Given however, and what can't be given must be taken. Reaching into the Void with one's own hands, to acquire or shape what is needed to more exacting specifications. This is the power to **Take**.

Accessing the Void is the first step to harnessing it's power. While the powers of Giving and Taking is best utilized within the Void, a Depthstrider can reach into the Void from the Switchboard by inducing localized curvature, allowing a temporary 'rift' be formed to reach into the Void. From there, a Depthstrider can use the power to be Given and to Take.

#### Further...
Taking from nothing requires becoming less than nothing, and this will be done by 'cancelling out' your information with negative information, opening yourself to the Void, and allowing it to fill without consuming. 

	The Less-Than-Blank-Slate Mind.

>"Stare into nothing. See the shape of absence. And maintain the knowledge of who you are."

Doing so allows emerging from the Void with more than what you entered with.

	We got deep into the cool lingo here. More clarification on what exactly is being done here is needed.

As for Giving, things fall into the Void. A query can be passed, focusing on a wish or desire, and allow what was already present to emerge. Its functionally ransacking the depths of the Void for whatever has fallen to it, such as the corpses of Striders past, or the more useful contents of Chalk streams that pour into it ceaselessly.

The advantage of Giving as a power is that it doesn't require nearly as much mental proficiency and fortitude. Giving allows for relative vagueness if the one asking isn't particularly concerned with the results, or the question being asked doesn't have particularly terrible consequences if - as an analogy - you were wishing upon a monkey's paw, or a very untrustworthy genie.

This is a double-edged sword however, as particularly vague inquiries may unearth things an asker would rather not come up, like asking for 'something really cool' resulting in an arm frozen in liquid nitrogen. Vague questions can unseal horrors; being arbitrary - though it can result in immense payoff - is rarely wise.

To be Given, you pose a question, and the Void answers as it sees fit. Virtually anything can be asked of the Void, and answers vary greatly. You could ask - for example - for when a bus will arrive, and you may receive a bus timetable, or maybe a photo of said bus at an intersection you know, or a promise that you won't miss it, or you may simply receive patience. There is no training or studying that can be done to 'receive better' from the Void; it gives what it chooses, but it will always give to those who ask.

Reaching in with the intent to Take is answered far more directly. Often you will get what it is you want - but also something you may not. Like reaching into a bucket of sand to reach a pebble, grains of it will follow your hand as it leaves. What this 'something' is varies as well, and while the Void doesn't act with malice, one shouldn't see apathy as an ally. This something is more commonly called a **Skew**.

> From a narrative standpoint, the Skew that follows all who Take from the Void is a useful thing. It can be a very easy and cheap plot device to drive narrative forward or off on a tangent, as well as serve as an in-universe 'balancing' measure, like frequently Taking having consequences. 

Giving and Taking are two sides of the same coin, with the difference being specificity of the search, and the accuracy of the results. Taking allows precise search due to exact knowledge of what is needed, allowing acquiring exactly what is needed, or shaping it from Void if it is not present. Taking could be split into The Power to Demand and the Power to Shape.

	Shaping is a power I think best reserved for Void Drifters.

Giving is granted additional advantages when the Void as Being is considered. Taking requires knowledge of what is desired, meaning what is acquired is already Known. Being Given is reaching into a very deep box filled with nearly anything, and as such, rare knowledge can be obtained, and what is obtained can be shaped by the Void as a Being.

A fair example of a limitation of Giving is asking for the corpse of someone alive. Since it is not present in the Void, it cannot be Given. However, were you to Know the entirety of the information of that person, you would theoretically be able to shape them from Void, using the power to Take. 

> As a narrative appendum, Giving and Taking having some elements of asymmetry and subsequently, 'spectrumicity' (is that a word?) allows for some kind of hypocrisy among the faithful of Vahn, with those who dress themselves as followers of Nugatory making requests that border on Avarice. 

#### Even Further...
Could Taking be perhaps a product of creating negative information with a shape - that shape being created by the intent of the taker - and have information, which will be what is desired, fill that negative information shape?

For example, if I wanted to take a cup from the Void, would I do so first by creating a 'negative' cup, reaching into the Void, and having that shape of 'negative cup' be filled by a regular cup? It very much seems to correlate with the initial idea of 'letting the Void fill you'. Perhaps it is not enough to just 'see' the shape of absence; you must create it as well.

Further specificity that is needed to Take could stem from not being able to get the exact positive information analogue of the negative information 'void' created. If I want a red cup and no such red cup exists, the Void might place a blue cup in my hands. But it will never give me a bowl.

It does still work with the initial idea of becoming less-than-nothing if forming a negative information 'void' was done - as an example - by inducing that void within yourself. Taking could be the manifestation of the desire to be complete; by inducing a hole, and using the Void to obtain the appropriately-(enough)-sized peg with which to fill it. It follows that something you want is necessarily, something you don't have, and (this works with both Giving and Taking) the aim is to obtain that from the Void.

Some things can't be Given however, and what can't be given must be Taken.

The issue of specificity is solved by Void Drifters, who's power to Take extends beyond Demanding, to the power to Shape. With it, you can obtain exactly what is desired from the Void.

### Wielding the Void
![[Weave and Warfare#Depthstrider Combat]]

## The Void as a Being
There was an initial idea for the Void as a Being that went somewhat like this; there was an amount of direction in the behavior of the Void that belied some kind of elementary intelligence. Imagine laying out a handful of rocks, and they constantly skittered to align themselves in straight line across the east-west direction. They are still rocks, but there's something more to them - something internal or external - directing them to behave in a manner that appears calculated, but cannot possibly be as the subject is rocks.

Similarly is the Void. When using the power to Give, what governs what emerges from the depths? Quoting an earlier section;

>You could ask - for example - for when a bus will arrive, and you may receive a bus timetable, or maybe a photo of said bus at an intersection you know, or a promise that you won't miss it, or you may simply receive patience.

You could assume that it is random. For the most part, it seems to be. But another way to look at it is to assume every 'transaction' with the Void is a product of an innumerable number of variables, all with varying amounts of influence on the final outcome. These variables could be nigh anything; the position of two random armillary stars, the body temperature of the person being Given, the timbre of their voice, the depth of the Void at that location, what was eaten by a person at a randomly generated coordinate - and all these pieces of information undergo calculation to produce a final conclusion.

The most significant variable of all however, is one emergent from the Void itself, that in itself contains sub-variables, one of which is the outcomes of previous interactions with the Void, another that induces outcomes which produce forward progression, and a final third sub-variable discussed further down. This forward progression sub-variable is abstract in what it governs, but it ultimately works towards providing those who interact with the Void a means to - ultimately - keep on living, pressing on in the realization of their goals. This variable is a mathematical push on the small of the back, urging void-wielders to keep pursuing all it is the endeavor to achieve. 

How these pursuits are realized is further shaped by the sub-variable that contains previous outcomes from previous interactions with the Void. It is a variable that maintains an element of pattern or similarity between previous interactions and future interactions with the Void.

If, for example, your request for when the bus will arrive was answered by a picture of the bus at a familiar intersection, and *also* in that picture was a shop with an 'open' sign on it, and you know that shop only opens at ten o'clock, other questions relating to time are likely to be answered similarly; requiring the asker to deduce unknown information from known - or acquirable information. A further example would be asking what the void-wielder would be having for lunch. The answer pulled from the void could be a picture-calendar from an agricultural initiative, with the picture tied to the current month being a display of farming equipment - with a field of corn in the background. 

The final - and most significant - sub-variable of the variable emergent from the Void is one that can be viewed as the apparent 'will' of the Void. The Void itself, for whatever reason, through the means it can, may shape events towards an end it appears to desire. In-universe theory is that the Void has - as is best interpreted - an appetite for entertainment, and this appetite manifests as the third sub-variable - a mathematical 'finger of god' - that shifts pieces on a board, ever so subtly, but in a manner that if analyzed over eons with the most powerful of computational equipment, reveals a pattern that is most reasonably explained by the presence of intelligence; awareness of what is present and happening, what is desired to happen, and the means necessary to reconcile the two.

The Void is functionally a blackjack dealer, owned by itself. It subtly rigs the game because it derives enjoyment from the behavior of those playing at table - as they interact with it and with the other players. The players imagine that the dealer is impartial, when in actuality the dealer holds a three-pronged fork of principle; keeping the game going, keeping future events consistent with past ones, and keeping itself entertained. It takes in the actions of players as data and uses it for it's endless calculation, it's three core variables modifying precursor outcomes into final outcomes, and at the flip of a card it's aims can change radically, yanking the game and the players in a completely novel direction.

What then is the ultimate aim of the Void? It is one of the many secrets that once Known, will grant power inconceivable. 

As a post-scriptum, these three variables could use names;
	1. The variable that produces forward progression: V-Forward.
	2. The variable that maintains the similarity between future and past: V-Continuity.
	3. The variable that enacts the will of the Void: V-Hand.

### The Defense of the Void as a Being
At it's core, this behavior and nature of the Void is ultimately an explanation for what can be described as 'authorial powers'; changes made and liberties taken by virtue of being the author of the world of Ven-2. 

It is however not sufficient to simply say, 'the Void exhibits unpredictable behavior because the author wills it so'. It is far more convincing and desirable to develop an in-universe explanation that says effectively the same thing, but most importantly, justifies it. The Void is a Being, but that being is not a god, rather an overarching 'hand' of mathematics, with an aspect of direction to its aims.

## The Void as a Philosophy
Delving necessarily into the canon, we can outline the effects the nature of the Void had on Strider thought, and the ways of thinking it spawned among groups.

An individual known as 'Vahn' was the first to delve into the Challenger Dark in the earliest days of the Switchboard, taking with him a company of fellow Striders, setting out to fulfill a Strider's highest calling; pursuing new frontiers. His company's research into the Void led to advancements in their understanding of the Switchboard, and from the acquisition of this knowledge was birthed an amount of charisma, that led to the cultivation of a following, soon becoming a cult, eventually resembling a faith. The Conclave of Vahn are those who chose to follow Vahn and his research, teachings and philosophy, learning of and seeking the deepest depths of the Void for truths and power.

Members of the Conclave typically append or replace a formerly held name with 'Vanitas', typically when they begin learning deeply of the Vahnic principles, and practicing with the powers granted to them by the Void.

For reasons that require further delving into narrative (that won't be done in this document), the Conclave is split along two distinct, oppositional philosophical lines; the Sect of Avarice and the Sect of Nugatory and the Sect of Avarice - both spawned out of differing conclusions reached when studying the Void.

	Nugatory is a word I've only recently learned, and doesn't quite roll of the tongue the way Vanity did or Avarice does. It is still open to change.

The Sect of Nugatory studied the Void and it's all-consuming depths and within it saw the inevitable; the Void would, in time, consume all there is and all there will ever be, and all things, all hopes, dreams, aspirations, all manifestations of human presence - will eventually be lost to the boundless, infinite dark. This realization prompted a further, worse realization, that all things were effectively without purpose except what is given to them. Followers of the Sect thusly reached a conclusion that their lives were to be lived as simply as possible, pursuing little, struggling little, living poor and humble and serving their fellow man, waiting for inevitable demise in the cold, cradled arms of the Void.

Those of the Sect who go further in this thought process view themselves as soldiers and priests of the coming oblivion. They offer up not just all their possessions to the Void, but pursue things of great significance (read, information density) to offer up to the Void, as ways of displaying their devotion to their creed. In return, their belief deepens, and their powers of Void grow. They most commonly utilize the power of Giving.

The Sect of Avarice reached a differing conclusion; that the Void is something they must emulate rather than worship. Followers of Avarice believe that just as the Void does, they too must consume - that they must be endlessly, unabashedly hungry and greedy. Hungry and greedy for any and all things; power, riches, secrets - anything that can be acquired must be, and in doing so they show *their* devotion to their creed. The Sect of Avarice thus prop themselves up as any and all things between leaders, bandits and explorers; anything that allows them to accumulate swathes of desirable things. The Sect of Avarice frequently wield the power to Take.

The Sect of Nugatory functions more as what is expected of a conventional religion, with the Sect of Avarice functioning more as a very large collective of like-minded thinkers; a political party, a crime family, a very large, very extended family or group of friends. The interplay of both between each other and those outside either groups is a constant driver of conflict across the Switchboard, subtle or sweeping changes orchestrated by the loud and outspoken or the subtle and clandestine.

	An interesting consequence of the difference of philosophy is the difference in power. Nugatory Vahnics possess greater pure Void power, while Avarice Vahnics must utilize tricks, devices and techniques acquired in their mortal tenures. 

Both philosophies  - despite their differences - hold a core belief in the power in the Void, and how that power in the Void, when grasped, allows reaching a higher potential. The first step to grasping this power is invoking the Drift Protocol. This opens a gate into the Void from which there is no returning from, beginning the greatest endeavor of any Vahnic; the Pilgrimage.

## The Drift Protocol
The Drift Protocol is answering a call of the Void that tugs at the mind of any who have plumbed the depths of the Void. It is a call of Vahn themselves, calling all to come and witness what awaits in the depths; all that is to be seen, all that is to be learned, all that is to be fought, all that is to be explored - things to be done that are doable nowhere else, all working towards honing the doer in the image of the Void that tests them. The journey terminates at the final resting place of Vahn, and lying with him are secrets untold. This is the Pilgrimage, and those who complete it are made into the Void Drifters. The trial that precedes becoming a Drifter crushes many, but those that survive have their footfalls resound across the expanse of the Switchboard.

### Void Drifter Powers
Void Drifters obtain the power to Shape creations from the Void, the power to Stride across the previously impassable [[SB_Astromechanics#The Veils|Veils]] that cordon off the Switchboard Sky, and true mastery of the depths, allowing wielding Void to their purposes with immense proficiency.

	As a snap thought, do Void Drifters cross the Veils via forming wormholes? Explore this idea later.

### The Dynamic Coupling Constant
There exists a relationship between curvature of space and dilation of time, an amount of the former producing a certain amount of the latter. The ratio this relationship is subjected to is known as the Coupling Constant.

When Depthstriders alter curvature as they Stride or fight, the spatial distortion produces a corresponding amount of temporal distortion. Due to the coupling constant however, even immense amounts of spatial distortion produce very little distortion in time. A Depthstrider at their absolute pinnacle cannot produce enough spatial distortion to amount to many, many fractions of a second gained or lost.

Void Drifters however, can produce considerable temporal distortion without need for much spatial. They do so by altering the coupling constant itself. Void Drifters are the only information-wielders with any true dominance over time itself.
