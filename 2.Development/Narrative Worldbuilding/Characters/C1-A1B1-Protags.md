# Characters: A1 & B1 Protagonists
The first and second-primary protagonists. The showrunners. The big wigs who are gonna fight for something. It's likely not justice.

## A1-Protags, The Strider Veterans;
Strider veterans who survived the Mysticism and the conflict with the Witch of Gates. 

### 1. Adven Ventura
### 2. Opal Hygen (PHldr.)

## B1-Protags, The Disciples (PHldr.);
Ventura's students, subjected to his new initiative to raise a new generation of Striders under the doctrine of the Strider Silkhand, and the dying wish of an old friend. 

### 1. A name; Io Vaktaré, & title; The Starwatcher
- Should Strider Pathfinding require actually being a Strider?
- Starwatcher is a tentative title as a result.
- The only(?) non-Strider, but valuable to the team/class because (reason). Has a poor relationship with family, especially father due to them being Striders. Write the document on Strider/Non-Strider relationships and philosophy.

- Io - the planet
- Vaktaré - Watcher (Swedish) 
Tentative
- Jasiri - Courageous, Brave (Swahili)
- Faire - Watchful, Vigilant (Scottish Gaelic)
- Mirador/Mirar - Watchtower, Lookout Point (Spanish)
  
### 2. A name; Kei 'Eight' Vollerei, & title; The Evangelist
> Nai Vollerei, my beloved.
- Detailed thoroughly below. Not the subject matter though. Strider and very proficient with Chalk. Their power is somewhat unknown as they use all manner of Teks. Follower of the Travelling Mage, Trevelyan.

**Power Words**
- Kah - Yes
- Keh - No
- Koh - A Question
- Kau - An Assertion

**Naming**

#### Notes (Collapse)
**Furthermore;**
Their character and story revolves around their studentship to a character known as Grand Mage Traveleyan, a Strider Sojourner of questionable place in history. They found a tome they believe to be Traveleyan's Codex, and live ardently by the teachings contained within, to the point of almost never acting of their own thoughts or volition. 

The Codex guided them in the creation of a staff (a MOD-46) and a conventional witch hat (their 'wings') as items they carry with them in addition to their Codex. The Arch Mage is almost never seen without them. Their 'magic' consists of the powers outlined in [[The Blank-Slate Mind]], making them accurately titled. 

Alternatively, the hat and staff - like the codex - also belong to Traveleyan for below reasons.

The character arc of the Arch Mage will be retracing the paths left by Traveleyan, aiming to relive their journeys to the fullest. Serving with Ventura hampers this ambition somewhat, but also places them in situations where the Codex (and by extension, Traveleyan) has no answers, and they are compelled to create ones of their own. 

Their plot is basically becoming their own person.

They actually joined Ventura's class on Strider Ritualism because Ventura is also a Strider Sojourner and they felt they could learn from them as they held the same title as 'Leyan.

Something about a pivotal moment forcing them to forge their own staff and hat (in the event the ones they used were Leyan's) and eventually reach some form of realization that their path is theirs to forge.

'Forging your own path' being the final teaching of the Codex, though this teaching is lost due to a torn page, proving that they actually did live true to the ideals of their mentor. 

### 3. A name; Fevyn Luceer, & title; The Messenger
- A character who's more phenomena than character. Depthstrider. Exists everywhere and nowhere in New Valkyjria at the same time. Works as a gear in a very vast underworld. Acolyte of the Conclave. (Debt to Lucrecia Vanitas?)

**Naming**
- Luceer - their name with a affix signifying their belonging to the Sect of Avarice. The 'luc' prefix also curiously refers to light, which is a bit humorous considering it is used mainly in the names of Vahnkin.
- Fevyn - abjectly cobbled together, 'vyn' affix used to indicate neuter gender.

### 4. A name; Rosentalla 'Rosen' of Kalstaff, & title; The Prince
**Naming**
- Rosentalla - refers to the First Arcology at Rosenthal
- 'Rosen' - a more masculine form of their name that they prefer
- Fel-Arcad naming often derives their last names from the joint name of the kin.



### Notes
Courier named Vanta(?), Visual quirk of being assembled by flocking birds

The Prince in dispute over Selspring or Raphael. Leaning towards Raphael.

Io, the non-Strider uses the PRISMpick; a relic(?) that works alongside the Slate for 'Kache Krash' operations as vault raiding is known as.

The Archmage is still without name, but uses the Tek 'Kah, Kae, Ko, Kau'; proclamations charged with power. Debated 'Arch' as name but might give them Selspring if the Prime takes Raphael.
