# Cryogen's Proposal: Blackjack
## "How did the Blackjack Dealer get there?"
Addressing the unfortunate truth that mathematics cannot have a grasp of entertainment. 

## Adaptation to the Rest of the Canon
- **Foreword** and **Authorial Powers** cut from the doc.
- Might have to rewrite the whole doc actually damn.

## Foreword
To begin with we simply must make a concession; the narrative design of the Void as a Being and how it functions by controlling the results of 'Giving' (among other things) through a litany of super and sub variables is such that the Void cannot be anything other than controlled - if not at least mildly influenced - by something that thinks similarly to us. 

The issue arises in one of the Void's **Anchor Variables**; V-Hand. V-Forward and V-Continuity (to the best of my knowledge, though I highly doubt it) can still be explained in a way under - and using - mathematics. That simply isn't the case for V-Hand. To return to the analogy used that is also our bone of contention; a 'blackjack dealer' is simply not a phenomenon that can exist in mathematics.

The blackjack dealer of the Void does indeed wield a three-pronged fork, but the most important prong is the one that manifests in the form of V-Hand - the 'will of the void' - and the fact that an essential variable of how the Void behaves is how or what it finds 'entertaining'. Mathematics cannot be entertained, nor does it have a sense of entertainment. Those are human qualities, and as such, we either bin the idea, or the Void must be sentient - properly. 

So is the Void sentient or not? Redesigning the variables might produce something more in line with the idea of a non-sentient Void, but that's assuming that a non-sentient Void is something we actually want. 

## Authorial Powers
As we develop WB concept after WB concept, we must ask ourselves what it is all for. Put simply, everything must (eventually) drive narrative in some form or another. Of course, anything and everything - used creatively - *could* drive narrative, but as we develop concepts we must aim to stay grounded, and thus it is optimal that we only pursue threads that can best answer the question of "can a story be told with/around this?"

The Void itself is an example of this. The three anchor variables if the Void are better seen as the hands of myself, the scribe behind it all. The Void is a tool from which I can - quite literally - pull fresh plot or the means to continue existing ones from murky depths. The Void is a plot device from which I produce plot, but to prevent the Void and 'Giving' especially to be entirely as a MacGuffin, I felt it necessary to establish rules that serve to explain why and how it does what it does, while also creating a guide for my own hands as a creator of the work.

Put better, the Void - narratively - works to keep Depthstriders moving forward, reconciling their pasts with their presents to shape their futures in a way that creates uniqueness and identity for each, and doing all in a way that is seen as 'entertaining' is ultimately, a reflection of myself as the creator of the work. So when that is established, what is the Void's analogue for... me? What is the string-puller here? We'll get to that.

	As an aside, does it help to see all of the pWB, NarratWB and by extension, all of Samsara, this way? What is being created? What stroies can be told with it? What are the elements that explain or justify certain decisions made by the designer of the narrative?

In revising the past conversations on the topic of a sentient Void, my takeaway was that the issue was never really with a sentient Void, but rather that if something had intelligence, will, desires, the capacity to do and undo things according to internal decisions made through internal calculations, it had to be explained *how*. And the 'how' is very simple.

To learn how the blackjack dealer got there, we must first learn who the blackjack dealer is. Enter stage right, Brother Vahn.

## Brother Vahn
As a foreword;

	The things discussed henceforth are not final. We are delving into topics bordering the NarratWB and the pNarrat; the pure narrative, elements which are in constant flux as we work through development of Samsara. Some parts are fairly set in stone, but those are the parts that simply have to be, and even then they are still open to tweaking. With that said, we may then begin to discuss a history of the Void, the Challenger Dark, and the Vahnic Clans.

The lore for the Void and the ChalDark begins with the early Switchboard and the progenitor families. For reasons that will probably make an epic prequel novel, one family chose to begin studying the supposed 'air resistance' in the Switchboard that opposed Striding, as well as the continued disappearances of Striders, seemingly without a trace. 

	This is infact a call back to a thread opened in Void 3.0, that discussed the idea that the entire SB was filled with 'fluid' that slowed down the Strider Protocol. In actuality, it was the curvature of the Void. The 'Einstein-analogue' mentioned then was Brother Vahn, and measuring the curvature of the Void led to learn there was no fluid, but rather something far greater.

Studies of the mysterious slowing and disappearing Striders was gradually intensified, with theories and such being made and dismissed rapidly, until it was finally decided to send something into a region of the Sky able to investigate the disappearances.

	Details; How is the Void measured and what instrument or method would Vahn have used to 'see' the ChalDark for the first time. For the curvature, measuring how information is 'drained' into the Void might give an idea on how to do so. As for the 'Void-diving' equipment, I imagined something simple, obvious and inarguably effective; a robot with a tether.

	Aside; Do wireless communications work in the Void? I never established if the Anarhiza can communicate with instruments outside the Void, from within it. Based on the essentiality of the root network that is above even the Switchboard for the DevitNET function, I am leaning towards 'no', and additionally so because it adds even more to te treachery of the ChalDark.

Before we continue the story of what happened next, we need to establish another oddity of the Samara universe under the pWB; **depthstones**.

The creation of the depthstones stem from the pursuit of the trend that Striders make use of natural oddities within the SB for the realization of their own ends. The depthstones are physical stones that have a curious property; they passively induce curvature around them based on their locational context. Depthstones in the Switchboard induce curvature around them to 'descend' into the Void, while depthstones in the Void conversely induced anti-curvature around them to 'rise' into the Switchboard. 

	How do they do it? Considering the sheer complexity of the mechanics at work in the existence of such a thing, I can only speculate as best as possible using my very limited understanding of endgame physics. It doesn't help that this also ties back to another loose end in Void 3.0; that of negative or 'anti' information. Inducing curvature requires information, inducing anti-curvature requires... anti-information.

	What is anti-information in the Switchboard? Grounds for another proposal it seems.

Trucking on irrespective of the finer intricacies of higher physics, we can explain how the depthstone functions under the logic of the Switchboard. A depthstone is a structure capable of amassing and containing quantities of information and anti-information within itself, and is also able to dynamically modify the levels of one or the other based on the surrounding environment. We can take a very simple approach to deducing the result of this; a depthstone in the Switchboard loses its anti-information to the surroundings and amasses information (in the form of latent chalk), altering the curvature of the entire mass of depthstone, resulting in it plunging beneath the Switchboard and heading void-wards. Once it reaches the ChalDark, it gains anti-information and loses information, inducing anti-curvature and causing it to rise to the 'surface' once again, reemerging in the Switchboard. 

So why do the depthstones exist? What narrative purpose do they serve?

Continuing the story, Brother Vahn discovering the depthstones convinced him that there was something out of sight, something that occupied a conceptual 'below' that he to see. And he decided that he had to see it for himself. He assembled a band of striders (as depthstriders didn't exist yet), all of them his clan members, and they embarked upon the first dive into the Void.

	Further on, I get into very, very speculative parts of the Samsara canon. While much of what is ahead 'works', it is not thoroughly established and subject to change, and a fair bit of it is being put together as this is being written. 

	Additionally, most of what is discussed would ideally have a companion doc alongside it; one that details the nature of the Void as a location - the Challenger Dark. The question of 'what did Vahn do when he went void-side?' would be better answered by such a document explaining the nature of the ChalDark and what it looks like. 

Trucking forward in spite of that, we may now go into the speculation section; my best ideas, as it were. Brother Vahn and his newly-formed, eponymously-named Conclave reached the Void and discovered rather quickly that the Strider Protocol did not function, and thus they did not have a way to return. Using their skills as Striders however, they very swiftly learned to survive the treachery of the Void, moving soon to thriving as best as is contextually possible. 

In their traversing and study of the Void, they eventually learned the Depthstride - particularly through observing the behavior of the depthstones. Grasping the power of the depthstride, however, led to the loss of their calcic powers. Power over curvature did indeed make them powerful in - at the time - unseen ways, but their lack of knowledge on how effectively to use it left them far weaker than their chalkstrider counterparts. 

Now, a couple of things also happened around this time;
1. The Conclave learned to communicate with those outside the Void using the depthstones. Messages could be carved on them and sent between the ChalDark and the SB.
2. The Conclave established themselves as what could by all metrics be called a nation-state in the Void, with Brother Vahn becoming the first 'Amaranth Sultan' (elaborated upon later, but not in this doc), named after the sea that spanned a vast swathe of the Challenger's Dark - the Amaranthine Sea.
3. Conflict began the progenitor families for 'reasons'.
	- Currently, my first idea is that the Fel-Arcad felt the Vahn were tampering with things far above their paygrade. 
	- My second idea is plain jealousy at the Vahn discovering the Void first, due to the 'nature' of the Fel-Arcad that will be elaborated upon later.
4. As a continuation of 3. the Conclave's members in the ChalDark were safe from the now attacking Fel-Arcad, but not so much the Conclave left topside. The Vahnic Clans there found themselves facing conflict with the Fel-Arcad, particularly noteworthy for being immensely powerful chalkweavers. 

Facing these particularly harsh realities, Sultan Vahn was faced with ensuring the survival of his family, kin and doctrine, and was ready to take drastic action. He theorized from his observation that the Void was littered with all manners of odds and ends that had fallen in from the Switchboard above, and this theory was proven by physical discovery of these very things - Teks, relics, ritual schema and more - often on the bodies of unlucky Striders that had fallen in and met terrible fates at the hands of the ChalDark's treachery. From this he concluded that if depthstriders were able to 'ransack' the many graves that the Challenger Dark played host to - and the many treasures they held - they would have a means to oppose the crusading Fel-Arcad.

With this conclusion reached and conviction steeled, Sultan Vahn and the Conclave set about accomplishing this by weaving the will of Vahn into the Void by means of a ledgerial cast, the cast making it such that all depthstriders become kin with Vahn, and all may pose requests of Vahn - and by extension, all of the Void - and receive power and guidance from it and him. 

	The ledgerial cast remains unnamed.

The cast resolved Vahn into 'quasi-mathematics', a sentient force that guided outcomes through pulling strings to alter variables. These variables are of course the anchor variables; v-forward, v-continuity - and the will of Vahn himself - v-hand. The casting of this ritual is the origin of the power to **Give and Take**, which was granted to all depthstriders in that they are all kin with Vahn.

	V-Hand particularly comes into play during but especially after the conflict with the Fel-Arcad. Coming to terms with the fact he was now phenomenom, he sought simply to see things through to an end; to observe the depthstriders and the Conclave and their pursuits in the Switchboard, lending aid where and whenever asked, subtly nuging things in directions he finds worth pursuing.

## Conclusion
With that, we achieve our aim; "How did the blackjack dealer get there?", through the machinations that led to Vahn taking the role. We conclude on a final note; the power that Striders have and are able to exert over their environment.
