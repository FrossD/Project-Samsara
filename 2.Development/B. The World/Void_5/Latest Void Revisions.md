## The Many Impositions of Vahn
> The mechanics of Praxis Impositions are outlined currently in [[The Astrolabe]] and will later be moved to [[The Blank-Slate Mind]].

The Vahnkin realize much of their power through **impositions** made with the Amaranth Sultan. These impositions, by design, serve both parties quite suitably, working to forward the Amaranth Sultan's calculus and amorphous ambitions, while granting powerful boons to his own kin and faithful. 

One of the greatest impositions made in the canon of the Switchboard was in fact, made by Sultan Vahn - then Brother Vahn - himself. When his family was threatened by threats internal and external, to defend his kin and secure the place of his brethren in the Switchboard, Brother Vahn made a pact with the Astrolabe itself.

> This is a noteworthy revision of much of the scattered lore of the Void that currently exists in a non-consolidated state. Consolidating this canon will be necessary for the Great Family document on the Vahnkin.

The parameters of this pact were as such; by surrendering the ability to ever traverse the lengths of the Switchboard or see its great stars, Vahn was given dominion over the entirety of the Void to serve as its custodian, as well as the ability to channel astrolabic power through further pacts with his kin. This pact came to be called the **Pact of the Star-Scorned Sultan** and its formation is directly responsible for elevating Vahn to the state he possesses now. 

> This actually revises the ledgerial cast described in [[Blackjack]] that Vahn performed to become the Void's calculus. 

As an extension of Sultan Vahn's restriction from the totality of the Switchboard, the power to where Vahn could not would coalesce via the mechanics of praxis, and manifest as the counterpart of the Strider Protocol that relies on the manipulation of curvature instead; the **Depthstride**. With the Depthstride, Vahn's kin could traverse the Switchboard in his stead, and spread the word and power of his writ and doctrine. 

In the making of impositions, Vahn is driven primarily by an endless capacity for enjoyment, the desire to proliferate his principles, and rooting for his own kin. For this reason, the impositions he make often confer incredible power on those he finds sufficiently capable of serving his ends. Vahnic praxis dividends are earned via the victory of Vahnic pactmakers over the many rivalling doctrines and avenues of power in the Switchboard, showing the doctrine of the Void as right, superior and powerful. 

Boiled down to first principles, this doctrine is one of **ritual ascetism**; denying oneself a litany of desirable things, in exchange for the power and positioning to achieve grand goals.

## Void Workshop
### The Drift Protocol 2.0
> The Drift Protocol currently exists in a state of limbo between earlier iteration and impending revision, and will be tackled in Void 5.

The Drift Protocol is answering a call of the Void that tugs at the mind of any who have plumbed the depths of the Void. It is a call of Vahn themselves, calling all to come and witness what awaits in the depths; all that is to be seen, all that is to be learned, all that is to be fought, all that is to be explored - things to be done that are doable nowhere else, all working towards honing the doer in the image of the Void that tests them. The journey terminates at the final resting place of Vahn, and lying with him are secrets untold. This is the Pilgrimage, and those who complete it are made into the Void Drifters. The trial that precedes becoming a Drifter crushes many, but those that survive have their footfalls resound across the expanse of the Switchboard.

#### Void Drifter Powers
Completing the pilgrimage to the Tomb of Vahn confers Void Drifters with a litany of powers;

## Prop. The Black Box
> This is a tentative section that's being developed in anticipation of Void 5. That being said, much of the writ in this section will make it to the final draft, and additional writ that hinges on subject matter related to this will now hinge on this. In addition to that, this section makes heavy use of more complex Samsara mechanics - particularly the writ under [[The Blank-Slate Mind]] and even intersects with quantum mechanics. As a result, this document and what it explains don't need to be understood, merely accepted.

### The Reverse-Curvature Problem
What is the source of the depthstrider's power?

[[The Void 4]], [[Weave and Warfare]] and [[Extended Disciplines]] highlight a variety of things that those under the school of black are capable of doing, but at their crux is a singular ability granted to them, from which all other things stem; the power to control the curvature of space. The Void already decides much of the curvature of the entire Switchboard, and varying permutations of relative curvature and the fourth-spatial-axis altitude of the Void manifest as varying phenomena upstairs, such as [[SB_Astromechanics#Flux Storms|flux storms]], regions of space that greatly interfere with the Strider Protocol, and locales where travel is risky, and it is easy to be captured by - and fall - into the Void.

But in addition to the general curvature of the entire Switchboard is the local curvature induced by depthstrider powers. By exploiting the fact information-massive objects curve the fabric of Danciran space, it is possible to induce gravity, and bridge the gap of the Challenger Horizon that separates the Dancirah and the Challenger Dark normally. This latter part allows for the more complex depthstrider powers, such as [[The Void 4#To Give and To Take|giving and taking]], which allows for plumbing the graveyard-depths of the Void for various boons as decided by the governing power of the Void, the Amaranth Sultan. In a sense, amassing large amounts of dense chalk causes the spatial distortions that depthstriders use for their powers.

But what about reverse-curvature? If information - chalk - induces curvature, then that would conversely mean reverse-curvature is induced by 'anti' information; 'anti' chalk. In which we find ourselves facing a rather complex problem. The Switchboard being made of chalk calls into immediate question how something like 'reverse-chalk' could possibly exist. This has been a hole in the depthstrider powerset for quite a long time.

There is however, something of a resolution to this, and it requires exploiting some of the more complex mechanics of the verse. This is made possible by borrowing some help from information theory - and at large - quantum mechanics. 

### The Negative Information Problem
> [[The Blank-Slate Mind]] is essential reading for this section.

The paragraph above is very literal. The entirety of how the problem of negative information was solved rests upon an article that somewhat addresses this subject - 'somewhat' in that it has been considerably streamlined for layperson understanding - that was generously provided to me by a veteran of related fields. This article can be found [here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/oppenheim/negative-information_p2.html), and is just about mandatory reading for grasping this section and the overall scope of this document.

That being said, the subject matter it discusses is immensely mind-bending, and as such, it is wholly understandable if it isn't grasped on the first or subsequent read. That being said, total understanding of the matter isn't needed to grasp *how it was implemented* in Samsara, though it does still help all the same. Having read it, you may proceed.

The initial problem with conceptualizing negative information was the idea of information that;
- You could acquire it.
- You would know less than what you originally did, as a result.

It was made all the more troublesome by the fact that chalk was tangible information, and thus reverse or negative or anti information would necessarily have some kind of physicalized form as well. Breaking the highly material nature of the Switchboard's design to realize 'anti-chalk' was particularly troublesome, as I have something of a fixation of a sort of 'elegance' to design that is somewhat disrupted by too many exceptions to first principles.

It was then a task of devising what *at all* would fit the bill of negative information. I was referred to the article above as a solution, and from my limited understanding of it, I've devised something I believe works. Consider the following paragraph from the article;

> But if the balls were quantum particles, then it can sometimes be that there is no memory of what colour they are.  A quantum ball can be completely isolated from anything which might record a memory of its colour (it is not just you who might have a memory of their colour, a ray of light which touches them can have a record of their colour).  Quantum balls can be kept completely isolated so that no light touches them, and there is no record of their colour.  
> 
> Now let us imagine that you have a quantum ball, which is black or white, and I have a piece of paper where it is written what colour the ball is.  Then I have some information, because my piece of paper is correlated with your ball. We could convince the referee that I know something about what you have.  But if you give me the ball, then I will no longer have any correlations with things external to me.  You have no memory of the colour of the ball, and so there is no test we can perform with the referee which will prove that I knew something.  By giving me the ball (giving me information), I now know less!

This is where it all gets tricky, but not very much so. The idea of it is that the means of proving something as true is dependent on the correlation of internally and externally held assertions. The truthfulness of a claim about the weather (internal) is greatly aided by looking outside the window (external). This correlation between assertions - or rather, correlation between the *information* gleaned from assertion and observation - is where the truthfulness of that information is obtained.

[[The Blank-Slate Mind]] handles this is in far greater detail, addressing how 'knowing' in the Switchboard yields 'power', but the realized power is conditional upon the quality of knowledge known. This 'quality', is measure of what questions that knowledge can answer; what uncertainties that the truth can satiate. This, in turn, is the concept of 'Bayesianity', which is also tackled in Slate Mind.

With this established, we now have a second attack vector.

The initial attack vector for solving the problem of negative information, would be some means of eliminating the knowledge possessed by a given subject. In a sense, if some means was used to 'forget' something - a memory - then by some means, negative information would arise in the vacuum. This wouldn't even be particularly difficult to narratively facilitate; [[Glass]] would be more than capable at doing this, and the usage of scintillate to forget is already established practice. The problem arose in the fact that negative information would have to be material, and it would additionally be something that exists in the memory strait. The interactions between chalk and anti-chalk - as well as the justification for the resultant of that interaction - would have to be devised. 

The first problem with this is that chalk and anti-chalk couldn't have anything approach a destructive reaction - similar to matter and antimatter - as it would mean that forgetting something would be instantly punished by an exploding cranium. The second problem was that of a chain reaction that would result; if something was forgotten and generated negative information, the fact that it is domiciled in the memory strait means that the produced anti-chalk would react with the nearest chalk - additional, neighboring memories. If 'destroying' a memory could be considered the same as 'forgetting' - and there really isn't any reason why this wouldn't be the case - the destruction of this memory would yield *further* anti-chalk, which would react with and thus consume further memories, producing a runaway domino effect that would eventually consume the lattice. Instant death, and worse than that as the anti-chalk would go on to consume all chalk there is, and end the entire Switchboard. A decidedly poor outcome.

The greatest irony of all, however, is that this first attack vector would never have worked from the onset as it categorically defies the baseline functionality of chalk. 'Forgetting' in the Switchboard isn't chalk vanishing into some recessed void, but rather the weft of a memory coming undone. If negative information is produced by the mere act of unravelling, the Switchboard could never have truly begun to begin with. Chalk can't be 'destroyed' in that regard, and if it could, there is little narrative justification for why destroyable chalk, the means to destroy it, and mechanics that facilitate the means of destroying it to infinitely propagate uncontrollably,  can all exist simultaneously. If there is a very tangible means of destroying the universe that doesn't require initiation by external factors, you must justify why there is still a universe.

That leaves us with the second attack vector; devising a means to create information that has *zero correlation* with reality whatsoever, and exploiting the ramifications this has.

### The Trick
> [[The Astrolabe]] is recommended reading for this section, particularly all writ on **ledgers**.

The solution to the problem of negative information is found by exploiting the mechanics of ledgers.

Consider this excerpt from;
![[The Blank-Slate Mind#^4c0668]]

That nothing in the Switchboard has truly zero correlation stems entirely from the fact that ledgers are a thing that exists. There will always be an external correlation that exists for the purpose of verifying true things as a result of all of the Switchboard's on-goings being encoded in the Astrolabic ledgers. These nigh-perfect ontological records of all things in the Switchboard are in a sense, the final arbiters of all things that are true in the Switchboard universe, in that if it happened, it is written.

So what if, then, there was a way to strike something from a leger? Redact it from record entirely? Call into question whether it ever truly happened?

Consider it this way, is something really 'true' if not recorded in the record of all truth-keeping? In a sense, yes; a database of the weather that loses the data for one particular day isn't the arbiter of the weather conditions on that day or not. It can still be proven that, say, it rained on that day by consulting other databases that still have intact data, or obtaining evidence from other sources, such as asking people, studying the state of soil and surfaces, measuring groundwater, etc. 

But what if that wasn't the case? What if there was genuinely one arbiter of what happened or not, and even more worrisome, things struck from record within it are struck from the collective consciousness of all denizens in the Switchboard?

All except, perhaps, the subject of what was struck from record.

Consider this hypothetical; something has occurred in the Switchboard's canon that is known to no one and nothing, not even the Astrolabe itself. Because no one knows it happened, none can respond in a manner that reflects knowledge that it did. That the Astrolabe doesn't 'know' of it either means that it cannot be factored into its calculations. Whatever ramifications the 'something' that occurred has had will gradually come to be explained by any other thing, and even the Astrolabe in time will come to reconcile this gap in its recordkeeping - or simply leave the hollow as it is. All the proof that exists of this thing happening, lies solely in your mind.

The 'reality' in your mind is not positively correlated with anything external. Without the testimony of two or three, the truth cannot be established. This information - defying all convention - has come to have zero correlation. It is anti-information, and by virtue of what it is, novel mechanics take hold and reconcile it into a new form; an amorphous darkness that chalk cannot abide, situated in the memory strait like a poorly-healed scar. This anti-information can yield no power, but it goes even further than that. It twists back in upon itself like a three-dimensional whirlpool, beholden to a self-containment that results from the calcic reality around it. In this twisting in upon itself - the achievement of a zero-state - all that is needed is to unbalance this state and allow for new power to be mined. An un-chalk for un-chalkweaving; an induction of skew upon the space-fabric calcic reality itself.

Reverse-curvature.

We are then faced with three questions;
- How to redact something from an Astrolabic ledger.
- How to store the anti-information created.
- How to harness it.

The answers to these delve into the Samsara canon, particularly the power of the First Amaranth Sultan of the Void, who has been granted considerable permissions over what can be done in the Switchboard.

### The Ritual of Ablation
> [[Chalk Ritualism]] is recommended reading for this section.

There is a power that comes with excising parts of the self.

One of the oldest design motifs for the Void was an essence of consumption - of giving things to its yawing depths and obtaining power as a result. The powers of Giving and Taking conferred upon wielders of the void is very emblematic of this. The trend continues in the form of the ritual of ablation, a means of sacrificing one's own information for negative information, obtaining command over the reversal of curvature.

Brother Vahn, the First Amaranth Sultan of the Void, has obtained unique permissions over background workings of the Switchboard via various pacts made with the Astrolabe early on in the inception of the Challenger Dark. One such permissions is the ability to - under various restrictions - interface directly with the Current, and thus alter the ledgers contained within. In particular, striking out the contents of ledgers allows for nullifying all external correlations the subject's knowledge has with the rest of the Switchboard, and thus begins the process of synthesizing negative information.

Much of the restriction upon what ledgers the Sultan can occur comes down to the consent of the subject party, and their doctrinal alignment with the Sultan and the things of the Void. When that and other conditionals are satisfied, it is a trivial task to construct a spatial barrier where the stars of the Switchboard hold no sway, creating an environment where the Amaranth Sultan can dwell and invoke the full limits of his power. In the ritual space, elements of the ledgerial and horizon ritualism are employed to scrape records from the ledger of the subject, induce negative information, and truly realize their power of the void. This is the ritual of ablation.

The outcome of this ritual - how much negative information one has to harness - is a product of how much one is willing to give. Scraping more information from one's own ledger yields more negative information at their disposal, and thus grants greater potency and control to powers that make use of reversed curvature. The cost of this, however, is fairly explicit. Should a depthstrider aspirant for power ablate a procession of their life from record, the Astrolabe resolves this lost record in all denizens of the Switchboard, resulting in their functional elimination from the minds of others. A procession of everything they've done - with regards to how it is remembered in the minds of those they spent that procession with - is utterly purged. All memories, gone. Friends, colleagues, lovers, enemies, parents and children; all have their own record of events functionally erased, leaving only the subject's record in their own mind. The more they choose to excise, the more power they reap as a result, but the further alienated they become to the world outside the ritual space.

For many then, it's a task of deciding what to keep and what to remove. What is valuable and what isn't. The ramifications of losing one thing, or the other, and how heavy or light those ramifications are to bear. Many find themselves in the ritual space for a very long time, endlessly deliberating. But for some, the task is rather simple, and they excise with broad strokes and little care for the ramifications. For some still it is even easier; purge their entire record right up until they entered the ritual grounds. With no life preceding their full inculcation into the Void, they emerge reborn in the Amaranth, and empowered beyond compare.

### The Black Box
Following the creation of negative information is its storage and harnessing. This is achieved via a device of the Amaranth Sultan's own making, described rather nondescriptly as the '**black box**'. Defined, perhaps, by either the immense mystery of its operation, or the matter it is designed to contain, this black box is implanted in the computational strait of all willing who undergo the Ablation, and serves to store the created anti-information, and create the conditions necessary for harnessing it as power.

As has been mentioned, very little is known about its functioning. All attempts to study it - often involving prying open the heads of those who took it - triggers an utterly unpreventable spontaneous deconstruction of the device into useless debris, a failsafe likely installed by the Sultan himself for reasons beyond comprehension. With regards to its construction however, the ritualism for crafting it makes use void and amaranthine components, glass, barristeel shaved from the physical structure of the Astrolabe, and immense quantities of chalk. Upon provision, the Sultan combines all these components in accordance to schematics none but him know of, and creates the black box.

While many do indeed ponder how in the name of stars they function, far more are satisfied with simply having a path to power finally lain out for them. Many of those who embrace Vahn, the Void and the power reaped through alignment with the depths are those who were not blessed with the powers to weave and/or stride, and the cruelty of the Great Sky to even those *with* those powers is proportionately sharpened against those without them. The opportunity to give something up - even though weighty - to obtain power needed to tip the scales in their favor is a welcome opportunity to many.

### Closing Notes
Some important final notes with regards to depthstrider powers.

Before the installation of the black box, depthstriders **can only induce curvature**. This is due to the fact curvature is induced via amalgamation of dense amounts of chalk at a point, curving space as a result. This power is a baseline ability granted even to the earliest convicts of the doctrines of the Void, and Vahnic principle. Only having the power of curvature grants access to the depthstride, storing things in the Void and retrieving them, as well as being given and taking, though all of these are conditional upon the local altitude of the Void; under some spatial conditions, these powers do not work.

> This can be understood as curvature powers only functioning if there is a positive difference in fourth-dimensional spatial altitude between the depthstrider and some target destination. The curvature-only depthstride can only descend from a location of higher fourth-dimensional altitude to a lower one, and giving and taking can only retrieve/obtain things that are 'below' the depthstrider in a similar manner.

Only when the black box is obtained are the rest of the depthstrider powers unlocked. In addition to curvature induction and condition-less depthstriding, giving and taking, and storage *and* retrieval of objects from the Void, depthstriders gain access to curvature reversal, which allows for shaping, grand summoning, construction of barriers, boundaries and ledgerial spaces. These latter bits are elaborated upon in [[Extended Disciplines]].

Additionally, negative information isn't **expended** in its usage. More correctly, it is **projected** outwards from the black box when in use, and summarily returned by will of the depthstrider. Ablating more of the self allows for a larger bank of negative information to use before some must be returned to the black box and projected outwards again.
