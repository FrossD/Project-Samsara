# Expansion Tracker
A consolidated means of tracking all the new documents that need to be created in the realization of the Samsara Verse. This cleans up the WN-DT, and lets me expand on them briefly here.

> Entries here generally come over from the **Thoughts Repository** section of the [[DT.WN-DT]].

## Proposal-Class Documents
This section is for documents demarcated as 'proposals'; the ambitious ideas that shape the verse and by far the most important class of Samsara document, right under Drafting Tables.

### Proposal: Spyndl Noon
The next stage in the precursor canon of the Switchboard, immediately following [[The Dawn of the Dancirah]]. 

The scope of this document is to have a series of **verse-defining** events that serve as the origin for many objects, people, institutions, places etc. that exist in the 'Dusk'; the modern canon that narrative will take place in. It begins with a skeletal outline of events, and then fleshing them out with almost full-fledge stories as we go along.

The core principle behind them though, is that **every single event** must have some kind of **lasting impact on the Switchboard** that exists in the Dusk era.

This is all handled in the [[Prop.SpyndlNoon]] document.

For now, the ass-pulled number of **fifteen events** hangs in the air. I'd gladly do double that if I could.

### Proposal: Vows, Pacts and Praxis Mechanics
Hex made an interesting point about vows or '**pacts**' as they more clearly put it'. I think that Vows has an interesting place in how they can be used, especially in vows between particularly noteworthy entities.

The idea is that vows/pacts can be made with entities that are particularly relevant of emblematic of certain doctrines (such as the Skydancers or the Amaranth Sultan) and this **creates an entry in the Astrolabe's ledgers** of sorts, that then praxicaly enforces the tenets of the Vow on both.

- If I am to really make this mechanic make sense, I will have to elevate it to the rank of a **Protocol**. Since we're dealing with the Astrolabe and praxis mechs, it feels downright necessary.

It's particularly useful for certain abilities in combat applications, as a decent pact can elevate a loadout to new heights.

- Some abilities like the Depth Strider Deep and Crescent Hollows work off of the pact that defines the operation of their formation.
- I will need to update those sections now in retrospect.
- Ventura's Sojourner's Tale works similarly with his pact with Skydancer Leilani.


### Proposal: The Aira-Thaûl 
> The scope of this proposal is massive, as it encompasses in no small part, the entire history of the Dancirah, the Lancasters to a large extent, other families to a smaller extent, the in-universe mechanics and far more. If Samsara were a game, this would be a DLC for it, a damn near universe expansion.

#### Foundation
Proposal Aira-Thaûl aims to integrate a new form of thinking weave - and thus, an entirely new sentient faction - in the form of the **Airani** and the **Thaûlmoth**, tentative names for beings that I have chosen to file under the designation '**Life 2.5**'. 

The logic of their existence is that the Switchboard, mechanically, seeds the evolution of elementary life. As such, similar processes as the ones that made the Third Kin are occurring constantly in the far reaches of the Switchboard, but the mechanics of spontaneous evolution, the unviability of certain locales for the emergence of life, and the fact the Astrolabe's logics currently oppose the process mean that beings like the First, Second and Third Kin will likely never arise again.

But it is all a matter of probability, and should the cards fall just right, complex, intelligent life can emerge from the inert chalk, and surge forth. 

#### Origin
By being Life 2.5, the Aira-Thaûl emerged sometime after the Vermeil and before the Third Kin. This leads to a couple of ideas;

- The AiThl *could* have emerged as a result of the Astrolabic Resolution that occurred following the First Praxis War. It wouldn't be too farfetched to introduce a sort of temporal break between the end of the First Praxis War and the Rise of the Third Kin. And this feeds fairly well into a second major idea I had that;
	- The AiThl are an **astrolabic experiment**, a proto-Third-Kin before the actual Third Kin. The idea stems from the fact the AiThl beings both have - for want of better terms - elementary or prototype versions of the Strider and Weave Protocols as innate abilites. As such, it would serve as a means for the Astrolabe to 'test' the measures it would later employ to resolve the unbalanced cheque book that resulted from the First Praxis War - the measures that would later give rise to the Third Kin.

- My second idea is that the AiThl are a *Vermeil* experimental creation instead. Anticipating their destruction at that the hands of the First Thinkers, the Vermeil began tinkering with intelligent weave and - in the simplest terms - engineering life itself, with the intention that what resulted would be strong enough to defeat the First Thinkers and thus inherit the Switchboard in their wake.
	- AiThl culture and more would thus be an expansion upon the Vermeil's own culture and civilization.
	- An extension of this idea, mad as it may be, is that the Vermeil could not complete their works, and thus the AiThl could not reach the lofty heights the Vermeil aspired them to reach. However, the *Astrolabe* - in a moment of minor resolution action - bestowed the proto Stride and Weave abilites that the AiThl now use, and allowed them to exist and even thrive in the Switchboard.

However;

- This idea and the larger proposal was seeded around the time I was working on a minor expansion of the Switchboard's cosmology, along these lines;

![[The Skywards Pursuit#The Curtains of the Dancirah]]

The Switchboard is divided into **eight Stellar Wedges** and each of these wedges is removed from the other by Veils so deep they have taken on new names; the Great Curtains of the Dancirah, that work to divide up the entire universe. As such;

- The events of Dancirah's Dawn take place in one colossal wedge of the universe, and the rise of the AiThl takes place in a completely different wedge, so removed from the first that the AiThl have become - in a very real sense - the stuff of myth.

#### To What End?
It begs the question of *why* do something so ambitious, and the crux of the idea is that, in a bid to explain every single thing in Samsara to define the verse, I found the verse lacking in something I have dubbed '**NarratWB mystery**'. Much of the 'mystery' that exists in the Samsara canon is held by denizens of hypothetical narrative towards the mechanics of the Verse; actors in the canon seek to understand, harness and perhaps even exploit the mechanics of the universe they dwell within. This is a pWB mystery, or series of them.

A *NarratWB mystery* however, would be, say, an alien civilization that occupies a corner of the universe made nigh impassible by a spatial distortion so great the only means to pass it are the highest apostolics of a particular religion. It is as great a great unknown can get in the Switchboard, and what I can wrench from it narratively is nigh bottomless. The verse simply needs it, and so I will realize it into being.

#### The Airani and Thaûlmoth
Let's talk about the Airani and the Thaûlmoth themselves. They are defined primarily by a pair of motifs.
- The **Airani** bear a **spider** motif, utilize an elementary form of the Weave Protocol.
	- A 'secondary' motif that is assigned to the Thaûlmoth is that of **weaving**.
- The **Thaûlmoth** bear a **moth** motif, and bear an elementary form of the Strider Protocol.
	- A 'secondary' motif that is assigned to the Thaûlmoth is that of **light**.

In a sense, they are the Switchboard's deviation other major deviation from the humanoid norm that is adopted by the Third Kin. I expanded somewhat on the Thaûlmoth via visual resources I found in study;
- Destiny 2's original ''**moth people**'' concept art; [Destiny Concept Art by Daniel Chavez | Concept Art World](https://conceptartworld.com/news/destiny-concept-art-by-daniel-chavez/)
- Starbound's **Saturnians and Thaumoths**; [The Saturnians | Chucklefish Forums (playstarbound.com)](https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/the-saturnians.4918/)
- This random **World Anvil** link; [4.4 - Saturnian / Thaumoth Species in Astral Confined | World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/astral-confined-elcadrane/a/44----saturnian-2F-thaumoth-article)

The Airani being spider-themed will need some visual resources of their own obtained later.

#### Final Ideas
A grab-bag of various other ideas that I had concerning the AiThl.

**Life 3.5**
Another idea I had was that the AiThl were the product of the Refrain or some other (minor) astrolabic resolution that went relatively unnoticed, and only emerged in the verse in the tail-end of Dancirah's Dawn, becoming more prevalent - and perhaps being properly discovered - in one of the many events that define Spyndl Noon.

For one, it would mesh far better with the existing canon than it does under Life 2.5, as we would be appending rather than inserting. It would also mean that it is something whose discovery gets to be performed in narrative, watching their emergence and studying it as it happens.

It does conflict with some other ideas I had, however.

**The Lancasters**
The Lancasters do not bear the Strider or Weave Protocols. It places them in an interesting place in the verse where at an ontological level they are incapable of interacting with the verse's mechanics the way others are able to.

I sought to rectify this by giving them more esoteric paths to obtaining equalizing power in the Switchboard. The **Esomechanist** superclass under [[On Weave and Warfare]] describes those who make use of nontraditional methods to fight, and my idea was that, through some means, the Lancasters interacted with the AiThl, achieved friendly relations, and then gleaned some of their power from them; proto versions of the Stride and Weave Protocols that are 'weaker' than the fully-realized forms in some ways, but stronger in others.

> This thought is part of a much larger Proposal on the place of the Lancasters in the verse entirely.

On this point, I also had the idea that just as the Sil'khan have their Skydancers and the Vahnkin have the Amaranth Sultan, the Lancasters came to - in a sense - worship the AiThl as higher beings.

**Bears and Observers of Divinity**
I had the first idea that, under the Life 3.5 contexts, the AiThl would worship the Skydancers **Nefele** for the weave motif, and **Shadri**, **Ciceré** or **Shalkarah** themselves for the light motif, the latter being an extension of a metaphor for light being symbolic of knowledge, paths, or just the plain power of the Switchboard. 

I then had another idea, that under Life 2.5, the AiThl *themselves* would be treated as a divinity by various denizens of the Switchboard, particularly the Lancasters. This latter point, again, ties into the larger proposal on the place of the Lancasters in the Switchboard canon.

**The Lustrous**
For a while, internally, I called the AiThl the 'New Vermeil' or the 'Lustrous'. I had a sort of idea that the usage of Glass would be something of theirs as well, though I never truly finished that thought in the absolute earliest drafts of this idea.

The 'Lustrous' idea is from the fact the AiThl were initially intended to be a much more fleshed out '**enemy faction**' that opposed the Third Kin in the Switchboard, and they did so primarily using Glass. The exact motive for this opposition was never truly established beyond the surface-level fear of strange things that don't look like you.

**The Ever-Present Intelligent Threats**
[[The EPIT]] was written to buttress the idea the the Switchboard is a dangerous place, and to do so, I sought to develop non-third-kin intelligent phenomena in the Switchboard that worked to oppose the Third Kin for various reasons, ranging from pure animalistic need to survive, to complex ideological differences and struggle.

The AiThl were to be the latter bit of it, and still can. They will, however, need necessary fleshing out, perhaps to the level of a Great Family.

**The Mysticism**
[[The Mysticism]] is a holdover from ancient Samsara development, and has been lurking in relative disrepair since forever. At its core, it is a terribly complex and immense power, and in the vein of Clocking from even farther back, I am unsure what exactly to make of it in the Samsara canon. I contemplated the idea that some quirk of their existence allowed the AiThl to utilize the almost imagination-based power that the Mysticism is, but I remain unsure.

**The Mystics and the 4th Magic**
A crack idea, the Mystics created the AiThl.

There is a very old and yet somewhat recent idea that I teased in the various stages of building Samsara, that surrounded the idea of a **4th Kin**. This 4th Kin would come to be realized by the works of the character of Salyne Khateleya, the Witch of Gates, and her allied faction of Strider Mystics. 

By virtue of understanding the Mysticism, they became mad, but were able to harness its almost divine power. They would impart considerable damage upon Switchboard society and almost collapse the Spyndl Academy, but ultimately they would be stopped, and the Witch of Gates sealed away in the Panopticon, in a series of events that would be documented under **Spyndl Noon**.

However, the idea goes that - perhaps - the Mystics succeeded, even if only partially, and the AiThl were the result. This idea has considerable merit in that it would be perhaps the most solid explanation for the Life 3.5 model of the AiThl, and would give the AiThl some truly interesting history as the creations of utter madness.


## Other Documents
Other, more common documents that sit below Proposals in priority. 

### The Red Pleasures of Leilani
The document on the Switchboard's **vices** of sorts; sex, spirits and the esoteric scintillates, the latter being a neutered - of sorts - Glass-based compound with mind-altering properties.

This doc will expand to discuss other things such as;
- Other vices, such as gambling.
	- Other not-so-vices, but activities that might have mixed dispositions surrounding them, such as gaming.
- Family-specific vices (very long term; needs all the families mostly done first)
- The sociocultural disposition of the families to these things as well. Especially sex.
- Perhaps some bits about Skydancer Leilani herself.

### Kit and Kitbash
A document that talks about the **equipment carried by Striders** in the Switchboard.

- This idea was seeded primarily by the fact [[Chalk Ritualism]] makes use of various physical components, and as such, frequent practitioners of Chalk and any kind of ritualism really had to carry these components around.
	- This was further accentuated by the fact rituals that require property weave require carrying various property weaves around, in a universe that generally doesn't allow you to do that particularly easily.

- I thought to call an invention to deal with this 'tackleboxes', an insulated case of sorts to carry calcically-sensitive entities.

- The scope of this document is able to expand greatly though, as I like the idea of a document that explicitly discusses the nomadic lifestyle lived by the many denizens of the Switchboard.
	- We should do that yeah, I'll change this heading.
	- I'll need to research nomadic living too. Fun.

### The Quasi-Divinities
Does Samsara have gods? Not really. But what they do have ticks enough boxes to pass as - albeit weaker - iterations upon the concept.

- Really, the Switchboard's divinities are;
	- The Sil's Skydancers
	- The Vahnkin's Amaranth Sultan

- The Fel-Arcad as a society are incredibly atheistic, and as such aren't really discussed in this context.
	- That being said, there are those who greatly revere - if not outrightly worship - the Arcad Rosen and even the concept and physical structure of arcologies themselves.

- The Lancasters are far more complicated, and are part of a colossal - dare I say it - **Lancaster Proposal**.

### The Star-lingo
This is part of doc-spanning initiative of sorts to document the **various tongues spoken** in the Switchboard. Particularly however, this one deals with the tongue tentatively called the 'Starwyld Common' or **Starwyl**, which - if I were to make an immensely premature guess - would be the language most commonly spoken in much of the hypothetical spaces that a narrative could take place.

- In particular I want slangs and expletives.
- Maybe slurs too.

### Skydancer Motifs
One must imagine the **Skydancers** having natures and personalities.

This exists in part in the [[DT.Notebook_Tracker#Skydancer Profiles|Skydancers]] section of the Notebook Tracker.

- It will need to be expanded upon of course;
	- 'Aspects'
		- Visual Aspects (colors, shapes, symbols)
		- Physical Aspects (objects, marks of office)
	- 'Aesthetics'
		- Garments and mode of dressing
		- Weapons

The aspects especially are important for **Pacts**, discussed further down, as much of these pacts operate via Chalk Ritualism to some extent or in some form.

The actual building out of the characters of the Skydancers will be done when the **character sheet framework** is built.


### Switchboard Units of Measure
Fairly straightforward; ways of measuring units such as;
- Speed
- Distance
- Time
- Other units I will have to ask Hex for

Does the meter exist in the Switchboard? The mind boggles.

- I can't find it in the vault so maybe I've never mentioned it, but amounts of chalk are measure in **tomes**.

### Switchboard Biology
When you cut open a Strider or any denizen of the Switchboard, what do you find?

It would appear we will have docs on Switchboard Chemistry, Physics, and Biology *and* the application of them to some extent in [[Switchboard Technology]]. It really only gets more fun.

- Interestingly enough, there are already some notes on Switchboard 'Physiology', almost in [[On Weave and Warfare]], under the **Theory of Damage** and **Combat Scene Writing** sections.

- My absolute most rudimentary idea for this was that denizens of the Switchboard were basically lone nervous systems covered in thick, woven, insulating chalk ribbon.
	- This will either be scrapped or expanded upon, but the general idea is there.

### Ritual Hand-signs
In [[Chalk Ritualism]], the usage of 'hand-signs' is both described and employed in various kinds of ritual casting. This is admittedly very anime but I love it and I am self-indulgent and so it will stay.

That being said, I want a standardized system of sorts for describing how hand-signs are formed, as well as a library of existing ones to form almost an 'alphabet' of sorts.

This is - at first glance, maybe even second too - an incredibly time-causing proposition for what is really just not particularly deserving of detail... but I don't care.

Where I've seen it employed;
- *Naruto* (extensively, they damn well invented it it seems)
- *Jujustu Kaisen* (they made it cooler imo)
- *Fire Force* (was really just the one time so I doubt it counts)

There apparently exists a book of these hand-signs of sorts already, which is rather nifty. I'll have to search for that.

In addition to the above though, I want a sort of 'hand-sign notation' to describe the formation of hand-signs, such as;

- Anchor - indicates a place on the hand where actions taken are 'tethered' to.
- Fold - a folding of the hand or limb
- Clasp - a fold, performed *around* something, almost to encase it
- Extend - straightening out the finger as much as possible
- Splay - describes putting an angle between fingers
- Spin - a rotary action performed around an anchor

There will be more to come, but this is the general idea.
