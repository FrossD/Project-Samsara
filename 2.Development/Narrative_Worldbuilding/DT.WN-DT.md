## ### Meta

- [ ] ---
- [ ] ### "Onwards, sunwards!"<br><br>The World Narrative Drafting Table; staging grounds for the work on the Switchboard's history, characters and lore. Here, drafts for new documents will be synthesized and realized into completed works.<br><br>This doc has a somewhat loose tagging system in play for the various entries, describing whether they are related to the **Pure Worldbuilding (pWB)**, **Narrative Worldbuilding (nWB)** or the **Pure Narrative (pNt)**. ~~Additionally headings are further divided into classes Alpha and Beta, as a way of expressing their urgency.~~
- [ ] **Below is a legend for the entire WN-DT**;<br>AD - Active Development<br>BD - Backburner Development<br>GD - General Development<br>EX - External<br>pWB - Pure Worldbuilding<br>nWB - Narrative Worldbuilding<br>pNt - Pure Narrative


## ### AD: Mainboard

- [ ] ---
- [ ] The maindboard of the entire WN-DT; for info that needs the most ready access.
- [ ] #### Ye Olde Grind<br>A breakdown of the most pressing docs to grind, and all the grind ahead in general.<br><br>**Priority 1**<br>- [[The Fel-Arcad]]<br>- [[DT.CANTHAR_2]]<br><br>**Priority 2**<br>- VoiFleur<br>- Character Sheets<br><br>**Everything (Frontburner)**<br>- The Fel-Arcad<br>- [[DT.CANTHAR_2]]<br>- Character Sheets<br><br>**Everything (Backburner)**<br>- Void 5.0<br>- SBTech Materials<br>- Calcimistry/Light<br>- Proposal: EPIT Nuver/Lustrous
- [ ] #### Tracker Drafting Tables<br>These are docs for tracking various things related to Samsara.<br><br>- **Spot Lore Tracker** - [[DT.Spot_Lore_Tracker]]<br>	Keeping track of lore created on-the-spot during development of other parts of Samsara.<br><br>- **Notebook Tracker** - [[DT.Notebook_Tracker]]<br>	Tracks the contents of the Samsara drafting notebooks.<br><br>- **Expansion Tracker** - [[DT.Expansion_Tracker]]<br>	Tracks the brand new documents that need to be created to work towards further expansion of the verse.<br><br>**Offshore Tracker** - Doesn't Exist Yet<br>A tracker for the offshore docs, incase they become relevant. Really we should clean that place out.


## ### AD: Priority 1 Development

- [ ] ---
- [ ] Documents mentioned here are under maximal priority for <br>development in Samsara, and are generally being touched and built upon on a near day-to-day basis. Other than explicit documents, bits of information on certain documents are kept here as well.
- [ ] #### Samsara Scribbling<br>**Fyre's Idea**<br>Strider Squad battle; 2v2 Fyre and Ventura versus Blakk and Hex.<br>- Arsenal Cards done; floor's yours.
- [ ] #### Families General<br>**Currency** <br>- Lancaster Innovations mints the cross-Dancirah currency, and it is the most widely accepted form of legal tender. The Sil'khan, Fel-Arcad and Lancasters en masse use this 'LIcoin'.<br>	- Fel-Arcad have arcology-specific currency that allows for strict internal regulation<br><br>**Tongues of the Switchboard**<br><br>- The Sil'khan unintentionally formed a tongue of their own, the **Starwyld Common** or **Starwyl**, that came to major use among the Switchboard's many nomads, drifters, outlaws, mercenaries, the Sil's own Sabai, malcontents and rogues. Contrasted with the NDS, it is said to be spoken sharply, crassly, and hurriedly, with many verbal timesavers and a noteworthy hand component that allows for skewing the context of a verbal statement, adding additional meaning, or weaving in a layer of subterfuge in the presence of those who aren't familiar with it.
- [ ] #### Drafting Table: CANTHAR_2<br><br>[[DT.CANTHAR_2]]<br>A most hallowed charge.
- [ ] #### Character Template<br>Building out the framework for building characters in the Samsara canon.<br><br>[[DT.CharTemplate]]<br><br>- Lots of stuff still in the drafting notebook.


## ### AD: Priority 2 Development

- [ ] ---
- [ ] Documents here are second in priority in the development chain, and generally these are documents that already exist, and are undergoing revisions or expansions upon their subject matter. As the case may be, they can be moved up to Priority One as space in that list is made available.<br><br>- Generally, new entries here are from the [[DT.Expansion_Tracker]] document.
- [ ] #### Calcimistry<br>Under [[Calcodynamics]]<br>(pWB)<br><br>- **PROPOSAL**: Macroscopic Material Properties, handled in [[Prop.CalcicChemistry]], all properties of all things in the Switchboard arise by virtue of chalk weave. This proposal will be appended to [[The Hands as Chalk]] and be linked to [[Switchboard Technology#SBTech: Mechanical, Manufacturing and Heavy Technology |SB Tech Materials Science]].  <br>	- Awaiting Hex's response to [[Post-Proposal Notes]].<br>		- Hex's response is that we need an explanation for how light works. <br>	- Ask them what they meant by 'walls'.
- [ ] #### Void 5.0<br>Under [[The Challenger Dark]], [[The Void]], [[The Vahnkin]]<br>(pWB, nWB)<br><br>- **The Void** serves as something close to a religion. It will have a 'holy book' (canon, codex, blah blah) and an origin story on the Vahn and the wielders of Void. The original Vahn had two wives, one with a Hungering Eye, and one with a Weeping Eye. They are the precursors of Avarice and Nugatory. Work from there.<br>- Ordained Vahnkin having religious-adjacent titles.<br>- Negative Information ([Write up sent by Hex](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/oppenheim/negative-information_p2.html))<br>- Update [[Prop.Blackjack]] and other Void documents where necessary with the concept of **Skews**, slight 'changes' added to things Given by or Taken from the Void, decided and placed there by the working's of Brother Vahn's **Anchor Variables**.<br>- Consider moving the Void related sections in [[The Skywards Pursuit]] to their own doc and link them back to SkyPur.<br>- Merge [[Prop.Blackjack]] and [[The Void]] as an update to 'The Void as a Being'


## ### BD: Priority 3 Development

- [ ] ---
- [ ] Documents here bear low priority in the development chain, but may be elevated as is needed. They are likely existing docs as well, not touched upon in a while.<br><br>- Generally, new entries here are from the [[DT.Expansion_Tracker]] document.
- [ ] #### Further on SBTech Materials<br>Under [[Switchboard Technology]]<br>(pWB)<br><br>- Further material dev; wood, fabrics/textiles, gemstones and crystallines. Possibly ceramics, polymers, composites, nanomaterials and semiconductors. <br>- This stuff works pretty well now that we have a somewhat fully fledged [[Calcodynamics|Calcic Chemistry]] system in the works. Property weave solves a bunch of our problems regarding how different tiers of materials differ from each other.
- [ ] #### VoiFleur Development<br>Under [[The Voice in Flowers]]<br>(nWB)<br><br>- ~~Shove Fauna in the Switchboard under here.~~ Create Fauna in the Switchboard doc and place [[The EPIT]] under it.<br>- As a note, it is strange for the Switchboard to have only flowers in the sense of something you pick from the ground. Add a modifier to the table that defines if the flower is picked from the ground or a shrub as the name implies, or grows on a tree, or from an animal in the Switchboard.<br>- Expand this into the entire flora of the Switchboard<br>- Might be worth ripping from Starbound again lmao.<br>- Either that or use the names from all the people I'm coming up with for the canon.


## ### AD: Revision, Restructuring & Administration

- [ ] ---
- [ ] Revisions to existing canon, and the restructuring of existing documents to more useable formats. Entries under here are slightly less urgent than those in active development, but works here cannot be neglected as they often appear hear due to errors in continuity between old canon and new.<br><br>Additionally, notes pertaining to administrative affairs are placed here.
- [ ] #### Revisions/REV<br>Revisions to existing canon, particularly with the aim of reconciling old canon with newer additions to Project Samsara.
- [ ] ##### REV: No More C<br>Without electromagnetism, there's no reason for lightspeed to exist, and things constrained by lightspeed as well. As such, we must purge all mentions of C from the canon.<br><br>- This is particularly only in [[The Strider Protocol]] doc.<br>- I might have seen mention in [[Switchboard Technology]] too.
- [ ] ---
- [ ] #### Restructuring/RES<br>Structural rebuilds of some documents, necessary when they grow particularly long, asking for a rebuild of the headings tree, or tentative consideration of whether some documents should be merged into one or existing documents be broken down into multiple smaller ones.
- [ ] ##### RES: Vault-wide Rebuild of Text Formatting<br>Under Miscellaneous<br>(meta)<br><br>A vault-wide rebuild of how text is formatted in the vault, using isolated tabs before text to show **my thoughts** and greater than indents to show **additional details or footnotes**.
- [ ] ---
- [ ] #### Admin<br>**Urgent Admin Work**<br>- Rebuild the reading guide and clean up the README.md<br><br>**General Admin Work**<br><br>- Take stock of the drafting note's contents<br>- Hunt for some docs that built off of things in the old WN-DT model. They broke with the Kanban port.<br>- Learn how to use Canvases.<br><br>**WN-DT Work**<br>- Rename 'BD: Expansion Sites' to 'AD: Ongoing Development 2'<br>- Clean up Synthesis column.


## ### GD: Thoughts Repository

- [ ] ---
- [ ] Thoughts and new concepts to incorporate into the Samsara canon. While thoughts had are stored here, they may not necessarily make it into the Samsara canon.
- [ ] **Sentiments**<br><br>- 1 Timothy 4:13-14<br>- The defining line of the book(?); tradition is not the worship of ashes, but the preservation of fire.<br>- "Fear the wrath of the patient man, and respect the elder in a profession where men die young."<br>- Dare mighty things.<br>- Love Elementalism: [https://www.vxtiktok.com/t/ZPR7mL1PT/](https://www.vxtiktok.com/t/ZPR7mL1PT/ "https://www.vxtiktok.com/t/ZPR7mL1PT/")
- [ ] **Nomenclature**<br><br>- Names are needed for the various tech professionals in ICT.<br>- Consider renaming Skydancer Cicerone to Cicere.
- [ ] **Tentative Narrative**<br><br>- **Ellaine Hex**; ~~non-Strider, becomes Strider somehow. Walks the hated path. Meets the King of Roads somehow.~~ Probably not lol.<br><br>- **Russel Walls** has a crew of people that support his ideals.<br><br>- **Russel Walls** plot point related to The Lattice as a Canvas; in his quest to become the Strider Exalted, he seeks to become More using the doctrine of Subjugation, which entails the replacement of lattice with 'higher' chalk, be it chrome or something above that.<br><br>- **New Valkyjria 2.0**; Draft a new model of the city centered around the bi-furcated model; the Fel-Arcad arcology in the more temperate north, and the actual city in the desert south.<br>	- Southern Desert Zone (SDZ) and the Northern Arcadia Zone (NAZ).<br>	- City One (Industrial, rural, more southern), City Two (High tech Urban, Less southern) in the SDZ<br>	- Fel-Arcad arcology in the NAZ
- [ ] **Miscellaneous**<br><br>- A document on the various **aesthetics and design languages** in the Switchboard. Something like 'Switchboard Aesthetics'<br>	- Big data in the Switchboard; everything being ribbon means that data centers in the Switchboard can look like giant textile mills. Ribbon can be kept in solid state storage like giant spools of thread, unwound into computational technology<br>	- Very cool aesthetic of Strider technology being a mix of centralized computing reliant on botanical structure, where server rooms better resemble looms. <br>	- This stuff will likely be discussed in each individual Family's Iconography sections.<br>	- Addresses Strider dressing perhaps? Though this will far more likely be done in the family doc for the Sil'khan.<br><br><br>- X,Y and Z axis for something; the zen-harmonius, zen-melodic and zen-(something). Just sounds cool; literally have no idea what to turn this into. <br><br>- Skydancer doctrines upheld by their apostolics.<br><br>- Maybe relate Teks in some way to the Vermeil?<br><br>- An elementary numbers system built from the y-naming;<br>1. fa<br>2. wa<br>3. je<br>4. kan<br>5. rin<br>6. ji<br>7. ta<br>8. san<br>9. jo<br>10. run<br><br>- Develop a language or at least an alphabet system.<br><br>- A note from Byf about **how common/regular folk might be apathetic to the causes and actions of giants; [Destiny 2 Lore - What's Next? What happens to Humanity after The Final Shape? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3v_9PnFzic)**


## ### EX: Assets & Tools

- [ ] ---
- [ ] External assets relevant to Project Samsara, and notes on various tools I use for development.
- [ ] #### The Samsara Grid-sheet<br>![[SamsaraExcel.xlsx]]
- [ ] #### 'Y-naming'<br><br>The Y-naming is a means devised to facilitate the naming of concepts, entities, phenomena and the like within the Switchboard and Samsara canon, using modifications of words translated from **English** to **Yoruba** (hence the 'Y').<br><br>The employment of Y-naming first of all allows for the creation of a linguistic 'baseplate' from which deviations can be made without them sounding overwhelmingly derived from English irrespective of how much scrambling and shuffling of letters is employed. There is simply very little that can be developed in even days of pondering that can sound or function as desirably as an actual language which was evolved over the course of multiple centuries.<br><br>The application of Y-naming is fairly simple; run a translate to fetch the 'Y-alt' of the word, and then employ a collection of developed of rules that allows it to translate and slot in to the Samsara canon. These rules are very 'not' hard and fast, with rules developed and employed on the spot and most boiling down to what rolls off the tongue the best now, and will still sound as they are needed to days, weeks, thousands and tens of thousands of words down the line. It is the very definition of winging it, but only the truly learned and eagle eyed will ever be able to suspect what is at play, much less reverse-engineer it.<br><br>The actual rules employed then, are ones of target and context; where we choose to employ Y-naming and the context of it. <br><br>We typically apply Y-naming when what needs naming is of 'cultural' origin or significance, such as a food, position in a royal court, or a phenomena first observed by a specific people. So while Y-naming may be used to name something like a waterfall, it would be strange to use it to name a piece of software. That said, this is also not a hard and fast rule - as just off the top of my head - the Breach Protocol could be called the 'Botini'; many keys, referring to it's ability to defeat all manners of doors. There is a rule about specifically 'Botini' that will be elaborated upon later.<br><br>The second rule - that of context - is one that we'll see employed mostly in matters relating to the progenitor families, all of which possess decently hard rules about how names are structured. Y-alts of names are subjected to these rules to produce a result that sounds similar to other Y-alts of names relating to that family. Subjective similarity between names in this way produces visible identity and differentiation. <br><br>The third rule, described partially above the section mentioning the first two semi-hard rules, can be called the 'tongue-rule'. The Y-alts of some words simply do not sit well on the tongue, or roll off it neatly as would be liked - such as 'Botini' above. The usage of random letters to add grease to some letters and grit to others is employed, and is often just a task of bouncing syllables and sounds off the walls until something sticks.<br><br>The general methodology is as such;<br>1. Determine if the Y-naming is to be used<br>2. If yes, fetch the Y-alt<br>3. Employ the tongue-rule as needed<br>4. Employ contextual rules<br>5. Employ the tongue rule again if needed<br><br>I could give examples, but no one is likely to see this section but me. When the Y-naming is used, it'll often be mentioned.
- [ ] #### The ''Grid'<br><br>The Grid is something I employed unknowingly in [[The Voice in Flowers]]. Put most simply, it is a means of creating a large swathe of unique but related entitles by defining parameters and expanding on what forms at the intersection of these parameters.<br><br>An example;<br><br>|       | Weapons | Cooking Utensils |<br>| ----- | ------- | ---------------- |<br>| Sharp | Sword   | Knife            |<br>| Blunt | Club    | Meat Tenderizer  |<br>|       |         |                  |<br><br>The Grid thus helps in simply defining what needs to be created, by first defining the hedge within it operates. Before we can create specificity, we must first obtain broad parameters and 'cross' them, and at the cross product of the common does the unique emerge.
- [ ] #### Milestone V1P0<br><br>**Milestone V1P0** or **Samsara v1.0** (**V** **1** **P**oint **0**), is a major milestone in the Samsara project that describes a means of demarcating progress made in Samsara development - development that will begin to take place after the establishment of the **Core Samsara Sandbox**, which is what the final document stack will be called somewhat around the time we begin work on the pNarrat - in other words, after the completion of the pWB and NarratWB. <br><br>Major and minor expansions upon the Core Sandbox will be indicated by the increasing version number, meant to denote this progress and development being made. As such, it becomes simpler to describe and track iterations of Samsara as it grows even after the completion of its core foundation.<br><br>This in particular helps in distribution, and the adaptation of Samsara into different forms. There is a dream of mine - a distant one yes, but such is the nature of dreams - that there is a tabletop game built upon the Samsara canon, and players issue lines such as "Oh this is built upon Samsara v1.12's mechanics." and "When will they move to SaraV2 already?"<br><br>The distribution part of it excites me the most. The ability for others to set their own tales in the Samsara universe, and have these tales have as accurate to the universe's mechanics due to having those mechanics on hand is thrilling, and will foster perhaps the first of the Samsara fan works to exist.<br><br>Soon.<br><br>Of course, it's still quite far away. And yet it is strangely nearer than we think. All it takes is more work, harder work, better work.
