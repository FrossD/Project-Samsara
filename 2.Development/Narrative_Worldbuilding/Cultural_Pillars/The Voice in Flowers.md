# The Voice in Flowers
A pillar of the Strider cultural ritualism, dealing with the flowers that exist in the Switchboard; their nature, the culture around them, and their uses.

## Foreword
The Voice in Flowers is a cultural pillar of Striders, that revolves around the 'bouquet-speak', an invention by a noteworthy Strider that sought to create a particular shape of the Strider, one of gentleness, artistry, and refinement. He sought to rectify the impersonal, isolationist nature of Striders by aiming to bridge the gap between them using gestures of gift-giving in the form of prepared bouquets, the constituent flowers each having a meaning determined by their position in the presentation vase, position relative to other flowers, their length and quantity and so on and so forth, creating a 'language' of sorts used by Striders to communicate along physical and metaphorical gaps.

Each of these flowers is a manifestation of latent chalk that has adopted some stray patterns from their environment, causing the chalk to take on new shapes, rooted in their surroundings and growing outwards, feasting on more chalk as well as more latent pattern. These run-off patterns dictate the flower's appearance and nature, the run-off patterns from a region constantly under the effect of heat and fire may have flowers around it that resemble that, taking on red hues, being hot - maybe even burning - to touch, and similar qualities such as this.

The real significance of these flowers and the patterns they feed on in their environment, is how they then become letters in two alphabets. The first alphabet is that of the bouquet-speak. Each flower has a meaning, but not a concrete one, and the interpretation of what one flower means in a bouquet is dependent - always - on it's placement in the the bouquet itself. A flower that symbolizes fire could very well mean just fire, but could also mean passion, love, or violence and destruction. Only from studying it's placement near other flowers can it's meaning, and subsequently the meaning of the entire bouquet, be deciphered.

The second alphabet the flowers belong to is the ritual alphabet. Flowers are an essential component in nearly every ritual, composing the essential letters, their unique patterns and the natures they induce being necessary to instruct and become a part of the weaving of the cast. A ritual's nature and aim demands certain kinds of flowers to be used in it's cast is the gist of it.

An essential aspect of Voice in the Flowers is sourcing said flowers. Striders essentially must hunt for where the aspect of a certain flower they want may be growing, which must also be one where run-off patterns form frequently enough, latent chalk is abundant, and there is surface and conditions for the flowers to even grow. Additionally, each have methods of harvesting, preservation and storage, and presentation, all of which must be followed to preserve the integrity of each bloom, for usage in rituals or presentation to other Striders. ^fd1ac5

The work VoiFleur needs now is these actual flowers to have categories, aspects and names. What can be an 'aspect' is vast; cold can be an aspect, so can machinery, and so can dishonesty. Ideally we establish some kind of boundary to work within and work out from there. ^4dbaac

## The Flowers of the Switchboard
VoiFleur and what it encompasses are immensely narrative-serving, in that as they exist, they exist purely as narrative elements of varying significance, rather than hard worldbuilding elements the way HandChalk or SlateMind is. They can be seen as the seasoning rather than the meal; less in theoretical but not in the practical.

The approach then is simple. Using the fact that flowers are primarily employed in the Strider Ritualism and the bouquet-speak as pseudo-letters to form the words and sentences in both of those 'languages', it follows then that we must define the letters of our alphabet. 

### The Approach: 'Bloom Codes'
The bloom code is an alphanumeric string that represents a certain combination of flowers. I came up with the idea of it by observing the 'tinkering' (or crafting) system employed in **Caves of Qud**, in which items that can be 'tinkered' (crafted) make use of 'bits'; alphanumeric symbols that represent component items you can acquire and assemble to form the final crafted item.

How it works is fairly straightforward, every tinkered item in Caves of Qud makes used of a randomized selection of bits represented by A, B, C and D, as well as another static selection of bits from 1 to 8. 

| Bits | Name                 |
| ---- | -------------------- |
| A    | Scrap Power Systems  |
| B    | Scrap Crystals       |
| C    | Scrap Metal          |
| D    | Scrap Electronics    |
| 1    | Phasic Power Systems |
| 2    | Flawless Crystals    |
| 3    | Pure Alloys          |
| 4    | Pristine Electronics |
| 5    | Nanomaterials        |
| 6    | Photonics            |
| 7    | AI Microcontrollers  |
| 8    | Metacrystals         |
- Sourced from the CoQ Wiki; [Bits - Official Caves of Qud Wiki](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Bits)

The numerical bits 1-8 are **tiered**, in that each is rare than the one before it, and as such used in more advanced tinkered items. An item, as mentioned above, has its recipe a random selection of bits from A - D and then a static numeric bit. A chemical battery - a low tech item - could be tinkered using *AB**1***. A pair of night-vision goggles could use *ABDD**3***, as it is a tier 3 item. A chain laser gun could be obtained with the bits *DDA**5***, 5 being its highest bit as it is a tier 5 item. A sphere of negative weight may use *ADDC**7***, using the 7 bit as it is a tier 7 item. Some particularly powerful items may make use of multiple tiered bits, such as the psychodyne helmet, using bits ***4578***.

So how do we adapt this to Samsara? Ritual schema and the bouquet-speak express the needed flowers as an alphanumeric string - the bloom code - that features flowers from A to Z as well as ones from 1 to 8, representing constituent mundane materials and esoteric ones directly representative of the 'tier' or complexity of the ritual. 

As such, we need to make **thirty four** names for flowers, subdivided into categories. 

### The Floral Alphabet
With twenty six letters and eight numbers, making thirty four individual flowers to name, we will begin first with dividing them along some lines. From the twenty six we take two groups of 22 and 4. The group of 22 are flowers that spawn naturally within the Switchboard, the Challenger Dark and the Vitric Shelf. The group of 4 are flowers that relate to the **Progenitor Families**, and only spawn under specific conditions.

From the group of 22, we take three more subgroups; a group of 12, representing flowers in the Switchboard, a group of 6 - flowers from the Challenger Dark, and a final group of 4 from the Vitric Shelf. Each of these subgroups is further divided into more subgroups that are defined by the relative rarity of these flowers in the local environment, thus expressing the relative value of each. 

These rarities make use of the same tiers as the tiered flowers, who's rarities are expressed as a percentage chance to occur throughout anywhere in the Switchboard, the Dark or the Shelf.

**Refer to the Samsara Excel docs for all the below tables.**

**The Floral Alphabet - Tiered Flowers**
| Tier | % Rarity | Name             | Provided By |
| ---- | -------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| 1    | 50       | Walker's Wyster  | Cryogen     |
| 2    | 25       |                  |             |
| 3    | 12.5     |                  |             |
| 4    | 6.25     |                  |             |
| 5    | 3.125    |                  |             |
| 6    | 1.5625   |                  |             |
| 7    | 0.78125  |                  |             |
| 8    | 0.390625 | Shalkarah's Glory | Cryogen     |

The bloom code for the tiered flowers is merely their numerical tier.

	A keen eye will catch that each tier is twice as rare as the tier above it, meaning valuable blooms become rare fast. I feel that - considering the power of rituals - this particular mathematical model applied to real life is 'balanced', as it were.

	Make Tier One flowers for all the Families. 

Before the table of the final four, we must discuss how they differ. The final four flowers of the floral alphabet are the **Family Blooms**, flowers that are a part of each family's canon and symbology, relating to its origin or significant events in its history. 

These flowers appear only very specific spawn criteria, relating to the family they represent in some way. These conditions - as of now - are as follows;
- Formed alongside a descendant of a notable figure in family formed via the [[Birthing and Being#The Ritual of Conjugation|Ritual of Conjugation]].
- Spawn immensely rarely on the astrolabic sphere from which the family can trace their origin.
- Weaves itself from the latent chalk when the core doctrine of the family is 'splendidly exhibited'. Better put, forming when when an event occurs that is an example of the perfected exhibition of that family's doctrine.

Due to their rarity, they are all **Tier 8** blooms, making them capable of fueling the pinnacle of rituals, or communicating truly monumentous feeling across with the bouquet-speak.

Because of the context of these blooms in relation to Switchboard families, they are often used in rituals by high-ranking members of those families, often for rituals relating to the family as a whole. In the bouquet-speak, they are a surefire way to curry favor, or make heavy demands of members of the family the bloom is presented to.

### The Aspect Blooms
There are two approaches I planned to take here. 

A bit of information is given on flowers relate and are used in the [[Chalk Ritualism]];

![[The Voice in Flowers#^fd1ac5]]

![[The Voice in Flowers#^4dbaac]]

The nature of aspects here is that it is a set with *infinite* members. It is simply not possible to define everything that could possibly be an aspect, and then create a flower that bears that aspect. I brainstormed means of consolidating down aspects into workable categories with far less members than outright infinity, but this approach failed.

So we went with the second approach; we use the flowers above and under some conditions, these flowers in the ritual alphabet can absorb and take on aspects based on where they grow. In cold environments, near machinery, near dishonest activity, some flowers have an affinity for these aspects and take them in, and that is what is used in rituals. This solves the issue of naming hundreds of flowers, as instead of having flowers that play host to the aspects of cold, or machinery or dishonestly could instead be a single flower, and where relevant, it be mentioned in narrative what aspect it has taken on and what visual and nomenclatural changes that might result in.

## The Bouquet-speak
A creation of the Sil'khan, the Bouquet-speak is a custom practiced by Striders as a whole as a means to communicate with each other across space using the various flowers in the Switchboard. By the usage of certain flowers and their placement in a vessel such as a vase, messages can be encoded, transmitted and deciphered. 

Of course, like language is, it is far more complex than this. The placement of flowers relative to others, the kind of vase used across the spectra of size, shape and material used, the height of the flowers, the number of them used, how the flowers are prepared before display - such as absence or presence of leaves and petals, whether multiple displays are used and the like. Utilization of these rules allows for sending complex messages that would translate to pages of text. It sees use mainly between the Striders of the Academy, as it is one of the only means of accessing the full rulebook.

Narratively, the invention of the bouquet-speak is an essential part of Sil'khan canon, an aspect to them meant to illustrate the divide between the current Sil'khan and their ancestors. It sought to create an image of refinement, poise and almost romanticism in not just the Sil'khan, but Striders as a whole.

	Of course, actually defining what every single flower meant and to hasten this appendum, the rules of the bouquet-speak would be an incredible undertaking. Narratively, certain elements will be mentioned when a scene involves debate over the meaning of a bouquet message, but the actual mechanics of it will remain - much like how it is in-universe - fairly shadowy.
