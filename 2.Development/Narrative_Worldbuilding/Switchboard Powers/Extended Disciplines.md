# Extended Disciplines
Once one has grasped the elementary doctrines of weaving chalk and controlling space, it is possible to take these disciplines and expand them in novel ways, to perform more complex feats. These 'schools' of techniques stand distinct from each other, each providing a new facet of power to those ready to study them.

## Reverse Unravelling Techniques
> The [[SB_Physiology#The Theory of Damage|Theory of Damage]] is greatly encouraged reading for this section.

The RUTs or '**RUteks**' as they are commonly called, denotes a school of calcic disciplines that describe non-lattice-intrinsic methods of repairing lattice damage. Being 'non-lattice-intrinsic' describes them as relying on systems outside of the subjects own lattice or straits, even if the techniques rely on them to be performed.

> As a note, the techniques that exist under here exist similar to various techniques that exist under individual **arsenal cards**; that being that they have been created by named or not characters in the Samsara canon. As such, this is a growing body of techniques that gets larger with time.

**The Fel-Arcad**
The Fel-Arcad, some of the most prominent scholars of weave, have worked towards developing a variety of RUteks for usage in various contexts, perhaps their most popular being the '**Three-Point Restoration**' technique, functioning by taking a 'copy' of the lattice blueprint from the memory strait and 'caching' it in the computational strait, allowing for significantly faster performance of the standard restoration algorithm. In addition to this, however, and why it bears the 'Three-Points' title, is that this copy of the lattice blueprint is only a slice of it, containing the head, hands and feet. Head for the sense, hands for chalkweaving and fighting, feet for escaping - often via striding. Maintenance of these prioritized regions of the lattice keeps a Strider longer in the fight, even while functioning on only passive regeneration.

**The Spyndl Academy**
The Spyndl Academy has developed a variety of techniques, designed with the fact that the users of them will primarily be Operators; skilled chalkweavers by all metrics. As such, Spyndl has designed RUteks that function almost as **gambits**; a risky calcic play that - should it pay off - recover an enormous amount of inflicted damage.

One such example functions by the subject calcically **stripping off the entire top-level lattice** of their person - in a sense, unravelling themselves - and then - in a burst of immense focus - driving the Five Straits to the very edge of their operational ratings, compelling them to repair all damage done almost in a flash. Executed perfectly, a Spyndl Operator can go from nearly waving the flag of defeat to peak performance in an eyeblink. Executed poorly, however, and the Operator can be caught in a dire strait where they have no top-level lattice material to serve as insulation from the outside, aggressing terrors of the Switchboard.

This technique taken further allows practitioners to expend part or all of their **flashcharge** to regenerate even broken or wholly maimed limbs, a skill that proves immensely useful out in the field in high-intensity environments. 

The primary limitation of this technique is that it is predicated upon supreme calcic control, upper-echelon rated Five Straits, and a relatively high integrity of those Straits. Certain kinds of damage that target the Straits can inhibit the usage of the Spyndl Academy's **Gambit RUteks**, and this damage must be healed from first before they can be executed.

## Barrier Techniques
The vastness of the Switchboard means that in most cases, something that is meant to be hidden or inaccessible will be so without any additional input, as - statistically - the odds of finding nearly anything of note via random chance in the Switchboard are immensely slim. That being said, it is often the case that one means to protect these things either way, and it is far more often the case that many things in the Switchboard are valued by its denizens to want to protect them by any means possible.

The supreme means of doing so is via **barrier techniques**. Through various means, it is possible to create a construct in space that serves as an impassable wall, blocking off entry or access to anything within the bounds of the barrier. While there are various caveats in the construction, nature and operation of barriers, the general intent of all barriers it the prevent the free movement of *something* past the barrier, be it people, other entities or objects. 

In practice, there are two major classes of barrier;
- **Weft Barriers**
- **Spatial Barriers**

**Weft barriers** are constructed of chalk via the Weave Protocol. By expending chalk to form dense ribbon, weavers can form sheets of chalk ribbon, and then through further advanced chalkweaving, extend this ribbon outwards to form a persistent, enveloping structure. This physically-created structure prevents the passage of things through it by simply being a wall.

**Spatial barriers** are formed using the power of curvature manipulation granted to those possessing alignment with the depths. By constructing what is effectively similar to the great Veils that cordon off sections of the Switchboard, it is possible to construct a hollow three-dimensional bounded space that possesses immense fourth-dimensional depth along its surface, such that anything attempting to pass through the faces of the space is dragged into the depths of the Void. Effectively, it is harnessing spatial distortion to cordon off a region of space.

Each class of barrier is with benefits and drawbacks.

Weft barriers benefit from the complexity that is achievable via chalk. A chalkweaver can construct barriers in nearly unlimited shapes, suffuse equations, Teks and ritualism within them, weave elementary and complex logic for their responses to internal and external occurrences, and far more. Weft barriers, however, suffer from much of the same phenomena chalk does. Depthstriders with their curvature manipulation can make quick work of chalk barriers via siphoning the chalk of its making, or moving past them by diving into the deep and moving across the fourth spatial axis, where chalk barriers cannot cover. Additionally, weft barriers can be broken with straight brute force, either through physical means or calcic ones. 

Spatial barriers - as pure barriers in the sense of blocking or restricting passage - are supremely more capable than weft barriers. Being distortions in space, they are immensely difficult to meaningfully interact with, and the fact they span the fourth spatial axis means that it is far more difficult to simply phase past them by diving into the deep. However, spatial barriers are really only ever that; distortions in space, and the toolbox for opposing the works of depthstriders - Antamaran techniques - is a considerably large one. Additionally, it is difficult for most depthstriders to form particularly complex shapes for their barriers, and thus most of them are only spheres, with the distortion distributed uniformly across their surface. The largest drawback of them all for spatial barriers is that unlike weft barriers, the erector of the barrier must maintain the distortion in space, else the barrier collapses. Without a depthstrider to maintain the barrier, the maintenance of the distortion must be outsourced to some other means.

Depthstriders having more simple barriers does benefit them in one key way though; the ability to dynamically alter the parameters of their barrier on the fly. If a subject were trying to invade a spatial barrier maintained by a depthstrider, they are able to skew the fourth spatial dimensions of a section of the barrier to more greatly resist attack. Chalkweavers are far less capable of dynamically altering the parameters of their barriers, due to the complexity with which they are erected to begin with. Adding more weft in one are to shield against attack will almost certainly be done haphazardly, and thus introduce exploitable faults elsewhere.

The final, and perhaps most interesting note, is that **Pale Amarans** are uniquely outfitted for the making of barriers, due to being able to both weave chalk and manipulate local curvature. They thus use the strengths of each to cover for the weaknesses of the other, erecting barriers that are nigh impassable, conferred with complex logics and powers, self-sustaining, shaped in any form of choice, and more. 

> When talking about barriers, often what is meant is the physical barrier structure itself. A space enclosed by a barrier is often called a **boundary**, and boundaries are used for a number of even more advanced techniques; primarily, the erection of **ledgerial spaces**.

## Ledgerial Space Erection
By erecting a bounded space through various means, writing a ledger, and exerting the writ of that ledger throughout the bounded space, it is possible to make another kind of ledgerial space in the Switchboard. This second type of space takes various names, based primarily on the erector of the space, such as hollow, territory, space, bounded-space, domain, the like.

The hard part of this is primarily writing ledgers. Much like the ritual schema under the chalk ritualism, the writ of a ledger must be painstakingly defined in chalk, and then the writ of that ledger exerted upon ever single coherent calcic entity within the confines of the boundary. It is an immensely taxing feat to pull off, and is often constrained to the most powerful beings in the Switchboard.

Ledgers being writable via the Weave Protocol means that chalkweavers are able to write ledgers, but the task of doing so as is immensely difficult. When coupled with erecting a barrier, weaving the writ of the ledger into that barrier, exerting the writ of the ledger over everything in the space, and then supplying the chalk needed for the entire construct to run, constructing a ledgerial space remains the domain of the strongest and most skilled chalkstriders. The fact most chalkweavers and Striders can't make particularly powerful ledgers mean their ledgerial spaces have to be used in other means, such as physically restraining a target, or having a concretely mathematically-defined space for the pinpoint deployment of techniques.

Depthstriders *can't* write ledgers at all due to being unable to weave chalk. Depthstriders who hope to construct a ledgerial space must make use of other avenues of obtaining written ledgers, this primarily being through **vows** made with the first Amaranth Sultan. Depthstriders erect a boundary via cordoning off a region of space via curvature manipulation, and then the Amaranth Sultan - a legendary chalkweaver in his own right - writes and deploys the ledgers throughout the space as requested by the depthstrider. This is the primary operating principle of the **Deep Hollow** technique used by depthstriders and Vahnic faithful.

> The Depthstrider [[Weave and Warfare#Arsenal (Depthstrider)|Deep and Crescent Hollow]] techniques are the most formalized application of this discipline.

> As a note, chalkweavers can write decent ledgers due to having the Weave Protocol, but erect poor boundaries. Depthstriders can erect solid boundaries via their powerful curvature manipulation, but cannot write ledgers themselves, and rely on pacts made with the Amaranth Sultan to do so.

> The **Pale Amaran**, however, being able to both weave chalk and manipulate the depths, is thus uniquely outfitted for the erection of the most solid class of barriers, as well as the writing and deployment of ledgers within them, making them the absolute most capable at constructing ledgerial spaces. However, this is still constrained to the upper echelons of Pale Amaran practitioners, but it does mean that a truly skilled Pale Amaran space-builder is capable of erecting spaces with none of the conventional weaknesses that come with leaning exclusively towards either white or black.

### Space Clashing
What happens when ledgerial spaces intersect? There are two kinds of ledgerial space interaction in this regard;

- When the barriers of two ledgerial spaces **crash into each other** while they are being formed.
- When a ledgerial space is expanded **within** another ledgerial space, resulting in one barrier enveloping another.
- When **two sets of ledgerial space rules** occupy the **same barrier**.

In the first instance, it comes down to the nature of the barriers at play. Refer to the table below for the interactions between **clashing** barriers;

|                     | Weave Barrier                                                                  | Spatial Barrier                                                                         |
|:--------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| **Weave Barrier**   | Barrier clash; the barrier with superior construction wins.                    | Spatial barriers ignore weave and subsume it into themselves, annihilating it.          |
| **Spatial Barrier** | Spatial barriers ignore weave and subsume it into themselves, annihilating it. | The spatial distortion caused by both cancel each other out, and the barrier collapses. |  

In the second instance, the phenomena of **ledgerial suspension** takes place, where the writ of the *enveloping* barrier's ledgers are suspended within the space of the *enveloped* barrier. This is an effective tactic for shielding against certain dangerous ledgerial space attacks, such as a depthstrider's **Hollow** technique, as expanding even a simple weft barrier would cancel the depthstrider's **sultanic strike** techniques against anyone within the boundary.

However, the walls of the enveloped boundary are still at the mercy of the enveloping boundary, and the writ of the enveloping boundary's ledgers still applies to the enveloped boundary within it. As such, the master of the outermost boundary is tasked with dismantling the walls of the inner one, such that they can once again impose their ledgerial writ throughout the entire space. Weft barriers caught within spatial ones are particularly susceptible to this, as the chalk-draining power of even the weakest depthstrider Hollows means the walls of a weft boundary will be passively 'melted' even without the depthstrider within doing anything.

The third instance is incredibly rare, but still happens; the rare occasion where the structural parameters of two barriers are perfectly or even nearly identical - such as in an instance where a combatant expands a boundary as a response to another, while 'dubbing' there's structural metrics - causing two sets of ledgerial writ to occupy the same space. **Ledgerial suspension** occurs in this instance as with the second instance above, but in a mildly different manner; bits and pieces of the ledgerial writ in action are canceled out by each other, resulting in a mix of rules being imposed in the space, and resulting - usually - in utter chaos.

In some instances, the instability of super-imposed barriers and conflicting ledgerial writ is enough to collapse both boundaries, and among those who frequently battle with ledgerial spaces, this is referred to as '**parrying a boundary**'. It goes without saying that executing this maneuver is *immensely* difficult, requiring pinnacle control of barrier techniques and knowledge of how ledgers function. 

> A final note, many ledgerial spaces are subject to **ledger inheritance**, where a boundary within another boundary inherits the ledgers in effect in the boundary above it. For this reason, the writ in astrolabic ledgers - such as the Strider Protocol - still function in sub-ledgerial spaces more often than not. 

## Mistweave Techniques
The mistweave techniques are a discipline of chalk weaving centered around manipulating and deceiving the [[SB_Physiology#The Weavesight|weavesight]]. Through combinations of inductive weave that targets the interface strait, as well as employing weave in the local environment, it is possible to create simple and elaborate illusions to deceive a target in the Switchboard.

The core problem that must be cracked by any aspiring mistweaver is finding a means to affect a subject's interface strait without them knowing. This is unsurprisingly quite difficult, as any damage to the interface strait will be immediately picked up on. The strategy then, is to find a means to make the targets own interface strait **cooperate** with the mistweaver that aims to deceive it.  

## Sealing Techniques
There are beings in the Switchboard that cannot be easily killed, things that cannot be destroyed, and phenomena that cannot be nullified. In situations such as this, the only option that may remain is to maximally limit the ability for the subject to interact with the rest of the Switchboard, and the Switchboard to interact with the subject. By **sealing** an object away, when done properly, it effectively interdicts it from the rest of the Switchboard, preventing it from exerting any effects on the Switchboard, and in turn preventing other parties from tampering with it.

The construction of seals are often an **extension** of the existing **barrier techniques**, reworked to act in novel ways, this in turn facilitated by usage of the **chalk ritualism**, which the act of sealing additionally makes use of. Mountains of nuance exists within the practice, ranging from the construction of seals to their workings, to what they are meant to seal and what even *can* be sealed, to the art of countering - breaking - seals. All this is elaborated upon in sections to come.
