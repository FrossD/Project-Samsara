# pNarrat: Weftcrash Narrative
'[[Weave and Warfare#Weftcrash|Weftcrash]]' is an in-canon term that describes the phenomena of a perfectly execute calcic strike and the revelations on the nature of calcic reality that emerges from doing so as the backlash. It in turn describes the very act of denizens of the Switchboard engaging in combat in general; weaving crashing against weave in an exercise to prove one as superior to the other.

This extension of Weave and Warfare serves to address the nuances of Samsara's powers and combat with a narrative engineering lilt to it, serving as the first sojourn into a formalized outline of writing combat that I've ever made. Much of what is laid out here will be used and improved upon extensively into the future.

## Meta - Terminologies 
It has become necessary to reconcile the various terms that describe supernatural abilities in the Switchboard, as in no small part they've been referred to - often simultaneously - as;
- Techniques
- 'Casts'
- Abilities
- Powers
- Weaving
and so and so forth. Thus we must work towards reconciling these terms and giving them workable, distinct definitions regarding what they encompass.

### Arsenal Classification & Terminologies
The culmination of all gear, abilities, casts and powers possessed by a subject in the Switchboard is their **arsenal**. Elaborated upon more fully in the Super-Classes section above, in this section we take a look at the arsenal classifications for the superclasses as well as relevant terminologies that aid in describing and understanding what is mean by the Switchboard's various forms of power.

**Gear**: The lowest 'tier' of arsenal classifications, and describes the **majorly physical weaponry** wielded by actors in the Switchboard. While some gear-_reliant_ powers are also in this category, it refers to the tangible weaponry themselves.

| Chalkweavers | Depthstriders                                                 | Pale Amarans |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| T1           | T1                                                            | T1           |
|              | T3 <br/>- Gifts from the Void<br/>- Possessions from the Void |              |
|              | T5<br/>- Shaped Arms                                          |

**Abilities**: The defining characteristic of an ability is that it must be something that can be performed **innately**. It refers to all of the powers that an actor in the Switchboard possesses usually by virtue of their bodily composition, such as possessing the Five Straits and the Weave Protocol, an attunement to the depths, or pale amara implantations. These abilities are combined with physical prowess in their execution, and are an actors basest level powers.

As an example, weave strikes, charges and shields are **woven abilities**, so called as they are woven into being using chalk and the innate power of the Weave Protocol. Depthstriders' ability to **manipulate curvature** is a result of their ability to fabricate **negative information** and thus induce fourth-dimensional depth and altitude. Pale Amaran's reconcile elements of both using the **polarity** provided by pale amara integrations into their lattice, allowing for **spectrum weave** and **chaotic curvature manipulation**.

| Chalkweavers | Depthstriders                         | Pale Amarans                                                               |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| T2           | T2                                    | T2/3 (Polar White)                                                         |
| T5           | T5<br/>- Chronodynamism               | T2/3<br/>- Polar Black: Point Collapse<br/>- Polar Black: Point Expulsion) |
|              | T3<br/>- Draw Strike<br/>- Formshift  |

**Casts**: Casts describe a swathe of Switchboard powers defined most simply by a jump in complexity. Differing from abilities but not wholly, casts are often reliant on something external, such as consumable ingredients, existing phenomena, or the acquisition of secondary power sources. Casts may also involve using **abilities** in more advanced ways, and in this category are usually the most powerful powers available to actors in the Switchboard.

For example, **rituals** of both the calcic and horizon variety (and all [[Chalk Ritualism#Alternate Ritualism|other varieties]] in general) are 'casted'. Most Tek-granted powers are casts as well, as they are dependent on the Tek to function. Depthstrider's **Deep Hollows** are casts as well, reliant on the conviction of the caster in the Void. For their sheer complexity alone, the **Aura Strikes** and **Full Spectra** abilities are casts as well. Judging by the fact most high-level parts of an actor's arsenal are considered casts, you might conclude the **Flash Protocol** would be a cast as well. Conversely, it is not, as it is reliant on the Strider Protocol - an innate ability - thus making it an ability-level power. Powers granted by **gear** such as Relics and Tools from the Void are considered casts as well.

| Chalkweavers | Depthstriders | Pale Amarans |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| T3           | T4            | T4           |
| T4           |               | T5           |

**Powers**: 'Power' is used fairly loosely in the Samsara canon, used to describe basically any 'thing' that an actor can do that would be filed under the department of 'supernatural' if performed in our world, for example. 'Powers' used more specifically however, refers to power granted by very external systems that are fairly removed from those that benefit from the resultant of that system's enginery. **Praxis powers** are good example of this, hinging on the Switchboard's transcendent interplay of doctrine versus doctrine. **Titular powers** are similar, drawing on the collective power placed behind names and titles that rise to lauded or infamous status in the Dancirah. 

> Something that breaks the mold a little bit are **chromegrafts.** Chromegrafts are not like the Weave Protocol in that cybernetic installations are not innate. That being said, the powers granted by a cybernetic can hardly be considered a cast, as that would be putting, say, a wrist-mounted machine gun at the same tier with grand rituals. For this reason, chromegrafts are treated as **abilities**, as their very tightly-interwoven nature with an actors lattice should allow for consensus that a power granted by a regular arm and a chrome one aren't different enough to warrant a differentiation in category.

### Combat Terminology
> This section is mainly intended to shape narrative - not storytelling per sÃ©, but rather the actual language used in the telling.

The flexibility of language has allowed for the terms that describe certain concepts relating to Switchboard combat to be used more loosely as required. That being said, it does help to have some working definitions for some thing.

All of the conventionally supernatural feats that denizens of the Switchboard are capable of can be arranged in **strata**, viewable as a series of concentric circles that expand beyond a subject at the center. 

- Subject >| Skills >| Abilities >| Casts >| Powers

**Skills** in the Switchboard describe just about any 'ability' that is possessed and executed exclusively or majorly through through the **mental and physical prowess** of a subject. Weaving fire and throwing it *isn't* a 'skill', even if the subject doing such an action could be said to be *skilled* at chalkweaving - that is an entirely different thing. Under the superclass arsenals, **skills** in general describe the various [[Martial Disciplines|martial disciplines]] in the Switchboard that dictate the rules surrounding unarmed and armed combat.

An **ability** in the Switchboard is fairly annoying to truly pin down a distinct definition for, due to the way the word is used outside of Samsara canon. Linguistically, an ability is a suitable term to describe *anything* that a subject can do, meaning that even concepts better described as 'casts' can also be called abilities. It helps then, to think of abilities as the **most innate** supernatural actions that can be taken by a subject. Their baseline abilities, as it were. If a supernatural action really only hinges on one concept to function - such as the Weave Protocol or attunement to the depths - that action is generally an **ability**. For this reason, the T2s across the superclass and various other slots in the arsenal are describable as abilities.

Additionally, the subject doesn't necessarily need to be a living denizen of the Switchboard. Implements such as **relics** have the various feats they're capable of described as **relic abilites**. This also applies to other implements such as various types of grafts (especially chromegrafts) and Slates.

**Casts** describe both **physical concepts** and their **execution**, and differ from abilities across a shared trend of escalating complexity as well as reliance on additional other concepts. The various 'abilities' granted by - or reliant upon - a Tek, for example, are viewable as **casts**. All kinds of ritualism, including quikasts, are **casts**. Depthstrider Deep Hollows are **casts**, as well as the actual process of summoning them. 

Another way of determining what counts as casts is there being a certain '**wind up**' to their usage. Rituals need to have ritual circles drawn, components deployed, the like. The Deep Hollow operates by hollowing out a region in space, a move that also takes time. Pale Amaran powers are generally reliant on executing the cast at a moment of near-perfect balance between alignment, and this in turn takes time. For this reason, the phrase '**preparing a cast**' is used often to describe the steps before *executing* the cast. But as mentioned above, the physical Deep Hollow structure can be described as a cast, just as the steps taken to erect it.

**Powers** are somewhat more amorphous, as they generally refer to 'power' conferred upon a subject by mechanics far removed from them. Much of these are the Switchboard's **meta** - praxis - powers, that result from the interactions between doctrine. [[The Blank-Slate Mind#Titular Powers|Titular Powers]] are a fairly solid example of this, referring to powers conferred upon bearers of titles earned through actions in the Switchboard.

**Techniques** is another fairly amorphous term, and is used generally to describe any form of **active** '**ability**' used in the Switchboard. In practice within the canon however, an ability or cast is subjectively elevated to the level of 'technique' when it is defined by considerable **complexity**, **efficacy** and **uniqueness** to a subject, as though supernatural actions taken could earn titles themselves. As such, '**technique**' is used often to describe '**named**' abilities; abilities that have been created by various individuals or parties in the Switchboard, and earned some prominence via various combinations of their visual and mechanical uniqueness, their general efficacy, the story behind their creation or their creators, and how widely used they are in the Switchboard. 

'Technique' is also useful to describe or denote collections of similar or identical concepts, such as 'Flash techniques', 'Hollow techniques', 'Weave techniques', the like. It is used almost exactly in the sense of the word - a means of doing a thing - thought granted higher status as a result of how it has been used.

Additionally, 

There's a grab-bag of other terms used in more exacting circumstances as well;

- Many Depthstrider abilities feature **summoning** or **conjuring** weaponry or other implements from the depths of the Void. This isn't a hard rule however, as many techniques that involve summoning something in general - with or without the Void - may employ 'summon' in their verbiage. 

### In Practice
Let's look at some examples of how fights in Samsara are written.

> The examples here borrow from the libraries of the existing arsenal cards in the vault;
> - [[Ven_AC]]
> - [[Hex_AC]]
> - [[Fyre_AC]]
> - [[Blakk_AC]]

- "Left to her own devices, Blakk will cast her Hollow. We have no counter to that technique."
	Here we have the usage of both 'cast' and 'technique' to describe the Deep Hollow.

- The Halo Dance ability possessed by Ventura's praxlance strikes with all the fury of a Flash at every minimal cost; all it takes for him to cast it again and again is calcic reserve, of which he has plenty.
	This is a noteworthy point that aids to differentiate between casts and abilities. The **praxlance** subject here has an **ability**, the Halo Dance. However, because this ability is innate the praxlance and *not* Ventura, using the Halo Dance is described as **casting** it. This is due to the rule of casts differing from abilities along the slide rule of **what they are dependent upon** to use; the Halo Dance needing the praxlance and some other proficiency (such as a martial discipline) to be used.

- "Give me an opening, and I will use the Oblige's 'Subjugation' ability."
- "All I need is an opening, and I'll cast 'Subjugation'."
	We build off of the above here, where the mention of the Oblige as the subject necessitates or at least encourages the usage of 'ability' as opposed to 'cast'."

- "The inductive effects I can inflict against Cendyr are meaningless so long as he can cleanse himself with the power of stars. Without a way to dispense of his ability to use that technique, he will cast it over and over without fail."

- "My power is that of summoning; I reach into the Void and wrench free my engineered arsenal. With them, I am conferred abilities without measure."
	Here is an interesting discrepancy; taking Blakk's Cache of Contraptions into consideration, why are the powers conferred upon her 'abilities' but the powers conferred upon Ventura by his praxlance, 'casts'?
	
	This has to do with the design of these concepts altogether. The powers of Blakk's contraptions are products of solely their physical **engineering**, and the fact that Blakk's contraptions are *worn* in their wielding lends to considering them as 'innate'. Ventura's praxlance, on the other hand, has abilities that are a result of their **inscribed ritualism**, 

- "Fair point. In response I will cast Hexblast."
	'Hexblast' here, under the rules of arsenal terminologies, is a cast, and is referred to accordingly.


## Meta - Principles
In all my time writing combat scenes, the core of them has always been two principles;

- Ebb and Flow
- Escalation

As a fight proceeds, there is an element of back and forth, where all parties involved in the fight have moments of lapse and surge, moving between moments of nigh-unchallenged offense, and playing defense as another character has their moment of pressing an attack. This is the **ebb and flow**, and is responsible for keeping the **tension levels** of a fight up, by introducing an amount of **uncertainty** in who will eke out a win.

That being said, this ebb and flow is defined by **higher ebbs** and **higher flows** as **time progresses**. This is the **escalation** principle, and it describes all that are involved in the fight resorting to increasingly more potent powers and reckless tactics as avenues for victory are gradually closed off, and resources expended in fighting run low. All this builds towards a point where characters are on the last of their strength, throwing their strongest attacks at each other, this principle being employed to yield the **satisfaction** of knowing **all parties gave their all**. 

As a note, using lesser abilities after using greater ones doesn't 'lessen' the current escalation state.

Consider the following hypothetical; a bar fight breaks out and multiple combatants are engaging each other with fists and kicks. When the fight grows more desperate, combatants employ broken furniture and bottles as weapons. Then, without anything to possibly signal this turn of events, one of the combatants produces a powerful revolver, downs another combatant with a single shot, then holsters their weapon and resumes engaging without it. Even though the revolver is no longer in play, all involved in the fight begin engaging as though it were - targeting the wielder of the weapon, employ more desperate tactics, flee, etc. - as the **awareness of its existence** is enough to **permanently elevate** the escalation state of the engagement.

Generally, the escalation state of an engagement cannot be lowered while the engagement is still ongoing, with the exception of truly esoteric circumstances. The escalation state often only lowers - to zero - when the engagement produces a winner, as well as renders others incapable of challenging them.

## Meta - AC Structure and Interaction with Principles
Interestingly, the Arsenal Cards are quite well suited for realizing the EbbFlow and Escalation principles, due to their structure.

The arrangement of all of character's abilities and powers into tiers from zero to five, and these tiers corresponding with a relative escalation in potency of the subjects abilities, means that there is a definite way to portray **Escalation**; quite simply through having subjects utilize higher grades of their AC as narrative time progresses.

**EbbFlow** then, is realized in the interactions **between** different ACs. As each subject uses a new entry in their AC, they momentarily gain an upper-hand (usually) - a position that may or not be ceded to another subject using some aspect of their AC as well. As such, this back and forth realizes the EbbFlow principle, and couples with the Escalation principle in raising the tension of the fight.

Expanding on that, the building block that makes up every Arsenal Card is the '**technique**'. A singular technique is anything a subject bearing an AC is able to do. A collection of techniques makes up a **technique set**, and a collection of technique sets make up the various **tiers** in an Arsenal Card.

For example;
Taking from [[Ven_AC|Adven Ventura's]] Arsenal Card;
- T2 - Elementary Calcic - **Tier**
	- Weave Charge - **Technique Set**
		- Interceptor Flechette - **Technique**
		- Fan The Hammer - **Technique**
		- Saboteur's Salvo - **Technique**

The tier structure within the ACs allow us to break down the realization of the Escalation Principle into two forms;

- **Inter-Tier Escalation**
	- Escalatory actions that feature employing techniques **higher in tier than the current escalation state**. The escalation state moves upwards as higher-tier techniques are employed.
- **Intra-Tier Escalation**
	- Escalatory actions that feature employing techniques **at or equal to** the current escalation state. This often entails using various techniques within a technique set. While this does yield *some* level of relative escalation, it doesn't cause the overall state of the engagement to raise.

Escalation can be seen as a series of **actions** and **reactions**. In a bid to gain the upper hand and push towards victory, one must employ additional tactics in general, higher and higher than the last used ones. As one combatant acts in this manner, others must respond in kind, as to refuse to escalate is often a surefire way to earn a mouthful of defeat.

## Meta - Further Notes
There is a bit more nuance to the principles of EbbFlow and Escalation, especially as regards how they interact with the Arsenal Cards of Samsara.

### 'True Tiers' and Non-Escalating Actions
One good example are the **T1 techniques** cross-board for all ACs, which general denote a combatant's martial and ranged/firearm arsenal. The rule with which these are place is something along these lines;

- T0 - Mundane physical fighting doctrines
- T1 - Weaponry
- T2 - Supernatural abilities

However, the T1 ranking doesn't do justice to the various **weapon techniques** that are borne by various entries in the T1 tier. A solid example of this is from [[Fyre_AC|Fyresworde's/Cendyr's AC]];

![[Fyre_AC#^828bec]]

This is a technique that **expends a flashcharge** to be used, and thus could be argued to be a **Flash Protocol** technique in itself, elevating this technique from the T1 ranking it sits in under the weapon that bears it - all the way to T5. This should, in theory, raise the escalation state and compel all other combatants to respond accordingly.

However, it is important to consider we operate within the context of narrative. As such;
- Combatants may not feel compelled to use a pseudo-high-tier ability at lower escalation states due to the lack of response-worthy threat.
- Another means of determining by how much - or even whether or not - an action raises the escalation state can be **efficacy**, an amorphous measure of;
	- The tangible, physical result of the action being taken
	- How other combatants **perceive** the action taken as well as its effects.
- The above then means that certain actions can be taken that yield effects or results in-line with what is expected by other combatants of the current escalation state, rendering the action taken a **non-escalating action**.

A tangentially-sound analogy is envision escalating actions as moves in a turn-based gain that draw 'aggro' or aggression from enemy combatants, inciting them to target the performer of the action as well as employ more advanced and lethal tactics, such as gap-closers or DoT effects.

### The Choice
The nature of efficacy as a metric is that the efficacy of any one action taken in an engagement is a product of every combatant within that engagement's **perception** of how effective or not a certain action is. 

Also decided by combatants is **how they will respond**. It is far more correct to view the denotation of escalating and non-escalating actions as determined by individual combatants themselves, as an action is really only an escalating action if it **prompts further escalation as a result**. Escalation should be viewed less as a knee-jerk reaction to an enemy's actions (bringing out your gun when the other guy brandishes his) and more so as a decision made with - ideally - strategy and consideration in mind. 

The decision to escalate or not - to respond to force with greater or equal force - is a decision seeded at the intersection of the nature of a combatant's AC, and the context and circumstances of the engagement. It can be the case that escalation is simply not possible, if certain criteria haven't been met - such as techniques that have activation conditions or need 'ramping up' to really be effective. The nature of an engagement as well may discourage escalation as well, such as fighting in a manner to reduce collateral damage to non-combatants, surrounding structures or to achieve alternate win objectives such as fighting in a manner that doesn't betray one's true strength, or defeating one combatant to leave enough resources available to fight another immediately afterwards.

Ultimately, to escalate is a decision made in the moment by those within the engagement, and ideally one that isn't made lightly. Once a fight escalates, de-escalation is really only possible when there are explicit winners and losers on the field. 

### Tier-Straddling States
All of the actions a combatant can take at a given time can be viewable as a deck of cards. It is possible for a combatant to have traditionally Tier 3 technique-cards in their hand, and they may even have played some, yet the current escalation tier remains below T3. Why is this?

Depending on the nature of the combatant's Arsenal Card, **techniques in higher tiers might be employed in the usage of lower ones**. This is denoted with the '**Axle**' tag under various techniques in the Arsenal Card. Some higher tier techniques may always be active as passive abilities, necessitated by the design of the AC.

A solid example of this is Adven Ventura's T3 Tek; the **Trajectory Calculator**. It functions passively to increase his accuracy with any and all ranged weapons, as well as anticipate oncoming projectiles to as to dodge or intercept them. You would imagine then, that by simply entering a fight with his Tek-enhanced Weavesight active, the escalation state of the fight would begin at T3. This isn't the case however, as outlined in earlier sections. 

A passive technique - and most passive techniques - are considered non-escalating actions, as for one they stretch the definition for 'action', and for another, the baseline state of an engagement and the combatants within that engagement are what must be escalated *from*. If the default state of a combatant is one where they have a passive technique active and affecting their person, the engagement escalates onwards from that 'T0' state.

For this reason, it is incorrect to say that combatants begin at the escalation state of T0. Generally, a combatant will have immediate access to their T0, T1 and T2 abilities without going out of their way or employing anything beyond the supernatural power equivalent of snapping fingers. In addition to this, passive buffs may be provided by techniques in other tiers.

This is commonly known as '**straddling the tiers**', and in outlining the state a combatant begins an engagement with, we use a measure known as '**T0 Straddled Tiers**'. This denotes the most immediately available techniques in a combatant's AC **without taking any actions** whatsoever.

### pNarrat: Effective Tiers
The arsenal cards are primarily an **organizational** framework that arrange character capabilities according to the **nature of powers** and the **relative hierarchy of powers** compared to each other.

Better put, in general, all Chalkstrider T5s will be more powerful than Chalkstrider T2s, as the Flash Protocol will be more powerful than elementary calcic abilities in enough cases that it can be classed as higher than it as a rule. **Effective Tiers**, however, are meant to account for the exceptions to those rules. Generally, a technique or arsenal card entry's **effective tier** is the true effectiveness of the entry with regards to its function. 

Referring to existing arsenal cards, while Riftlock Blakk's *Blakk's Breaker* is listed as an ability under her T1 *Rift Vibrokhopesh*, its actual effective tier is T5 - the same level as a Flash Protocol. In a similar vein, while Operator Adven Ventura has T1 and T2 abilities and techniques, in reality his entire arsenal card has *T3* as the *floor*, with even his weakest abilities hitting at a power close or equivalent to that of a Tek. 

For this reason, while arsenal cards are used for development of Samsara, in-canon, a different cross-context classification yardstick is used.

T7 - Nobarc  
T6 - Ehnkarahn  
T5 - Karahn 
T4 - Vasanc  
T3 - Yolyn
T2 - Larvek  
T1 - Minde  
T0 - Tylest

> These names are **very** very not final.
> The exception is the T5 bearing 'Karahn' designation.
> This sucks tbh.
