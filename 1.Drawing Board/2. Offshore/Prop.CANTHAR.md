**The Charge**:
> "What do you need me to write?"
> "The end of the PhD at Pittsburgh."

**Modifiers**:
> "must be compatible with my lore"

	Curious how this will work, but we move.

> Maybe it doesn't have to be totally lore-compatible, as I don't want to restrict your creative freedom.
> Offer of collaboration.

	What do you want the story to convey?

> The atrocity of academia. Every infuriating failure of bureaucracy. The lie they tell you and say is physics.
> These are first thoughts.
> The point is to make things more dramatic than they actually are. Perhaps the academy is harvesting plants for negentropy or such.
> **It is important that this is a fight I lose.**

	Okay. I can work with this. And I have a pitch but I am unsure what you'll think of it, as it could very well be seen as somewhat underhanded.

> A pitch from friends; talking about the Ocenagate debacle, I presume. 'Andy was the CEO who took everyone down with his arrogance and disregard for safety and human lives.'

	The pitch I have comes clearer into focus.

> You know, I'm growing attached to the submarine angle.
> 'Descent' as a theme resonates with me.

	Oh boy.

> Something about the catastrophic absurdity of failures.
> Further you go down, the more you convince yourself you'll return to the surface soon enough.
> You're reluctant to believe the people in charge are incompetent.
> As each preposterous failing is revealed, worry builds and it becomes harder to have faith in the supposed superiors.

	An escalation of events as it were. My pitch comes clearer into focus.

> And right up until the collapse, you still feel there's a way out, a way to the bottom, that whatever is down there is worth it, even as doom looms on the horizon. That people are just allowed to be this way and that there's no one who's going to plumb the depths to stop them or save you.

> **This does leave the question: through what medium are we descending? And what is so important at the bottom to be worth risking?**

	Yeah I think I know what to do.

> Eldritch abomination? Discuss.
> Black holes? Too interstellar.
> Treasure planet?
> **Some kind of power?**

	Yes.

> Are you ignoring me, by the way?

	Never.

## Canthar: Cryogen's Proposal
I must mention that when I head a document with proposal, I get minor stat boosts cross-board. There's nothing quite like a new doc on a new thing, and there's *nothing* quite like a proposal-class document. There's a pen-pusher in a financial sector somewhere who keeps the world spinning who calls all their paperwork 'writs of fortune transfer' and 'details of the wager' and this is how they remain sane. They will one day accidentally refer to their boss as a duke or duchess and the net revenue as the coffers, and the silence that will follow will finally confirm his psychologist's diagnosis of high-functioning autism. I digress.

You raise an interesting proposal and it's one I can work with, but only in a manner that's slightly underhanded. Behold my pitch; we write Canthar **not about Hexagonelle, but about Ellaine Hex**, and the story takes place in a snapshot of Samsara canon. Why this might be perceived as underhanded is that it is a not-in-the-least subtle way to have my cake of working on Samsara and eating it too, and thus I leave it to your discretion.

Now behold my argument.

The canon for Ellaine Hex like with most of my characters is shaky an inconclusive. Mostly I have some visual motifs, one-liners delivered to the porcelain tiles in the shower, and very long lists of attacks and special moves. But for some I do have actually relevant - dare I say workable - establishing canon, and Ellaine is one such lucky character.

Ellaine is three things in the Samsara canon that takes you far in the universe. First is a Chalkweaver. The Weave Protocol is not trivial power and it enables playing fast and flashy with the world's physics. The second is an Operator, but not one from Spyndl. The 'plot' of whatever spawns from the ever-growing hydra that is Project Samsara is very hydra-like in how lopping off one head yields two others. As such, there are buoys of concrete canon in a sea of inconclusive idea-fluid. One such recently-minted concrete ideas is that of **multiple Academies**. Spyndl is one such Academy - the one referred to as *the* Academy - and boasts in its old age and the heritage that comes with it. Other such academies - mainly just a name and a foundational idea at this point - include Sakerfel and Dustarin. Ellaine Hex in these very early drafts is from Dustarin, which is situated in a wedge different from where one of the major branches of Spyndl - and where the ever-shifting story of Samsara might take place. 'Wedges' are also recent developments; I'll elaborate some other time.

The third thing Ellaine Hex is, is driven. In an endeavor to realize a true-as-possible to life rendition of the real Hexagonelle, I set out to imbue in Ellaine Hex a sort of penchant for overcoming adversity. Detailed in the various bits of HexLore I've been provided and gleaned from multiple years of conversation, is an uncommon drive against odds that have proven rather recently to have been uncommonly cruel. I will not pick at fresh wounds, but I approach the meat of my proposal.

Consider if you will, the act of flux diving.

In perhaps a subconscious desire to tie you to the Void you so elegantly crafted, wrenched like a screaming newborn from the bowels of my calling the Void a particle, Ellaine Hex is an Operator Flux Diver, one of the few skilled enough to dive into active flux storms; areas of immense fourth-dimensional spatial instability, where space kinks and tears and churns. Why do you do this? Many reasons. When flux storms surge, the gap between the Challenger Horizon grows thin, and the gap between the Dancirah and the Challenger Dark shrinks. Lost Striders, stranded starships, dropped relics; objects and things of interest recently lost to the Void may be dragged close enough to the surface for a Chalkweaver to delve into the storm and retrieve them, without falling totally into the Void and becoming victim to the terrors within. While those who still lean to the calcic may traverse the Void, the stardrip is caustic to their lattices, and the First Sultan is not one for guests.

The hand being dealt is a mean one, as it were.

It thus means that it is a profession with very distinct divisions within it; the veterans who have served for a dozen processions and seem utterly unkillable right up until the moment they are, and the revolving door of newbies who come in bright-eyed at the prospect of grinding one of the Switchboard's hardest jobs to earn quick repute, only to be cut down to size by the training, trampled by the jaded veterans, come face to face with indescribable danger, and either turn tail and flee, be killed before they can - or worse - survive long enough to see the lights in their eyes fade and they become another cog in a very hungry machine.

Of course there are the ideologues and the reformists; those who demand we do things better, but as these things tend to go they are often prevented from making any real progress, either by the weighty apathy of those who can't envision brighter futures, or the active malice of those who benefit from dark presents. 

It is into this fray we insert Ellaine Hex, the absolute worst (best) kind of ideologue and reformist; one who won't fucking shut up. It draws the ire of those around them, and this ire grows due to the fact Ellaine just keeps coming back. Just keeps taking it, swallowing it down and pushing forward. Their overwhelming competence is simply undeniable, and no good deed can go unpunished.

Let's talk narrative and levers.

It is pivotal to both you and the story you aim to mirror that you lose. How this happens is subject to a number of levers we can pull. We can isolate three things from the PhD debacle that conveniently is also the levers we will work with;

- A tenuous relationship with the subject matter at hand, leading to or perhaps stemming from a disinterest in that subject matter, which manifests as apathy - going through the motions as it were - choosing instead to pursue the theater of doing things rather than actually doing them.
- Startling incompetence, rife in everything and everyone, stemming from those who perceive dumb luck as innate skill, those who think the fact it worked yesterday means it'll work today, those who insist on endless red-tape and kowtowing to due process, and those who simply don't give enough of a shit, often a result of the point above. There is ongoing rot at all levels that no one wants to address or even acknowledge beyond the most surface-level, low-effort, milquetoast, "Huh, that glowing green stuff really shouldn't be leaking from the ceiling yeah."
- Active, covert - maybe even overt - malice, from those with power and comfy seats against those they perceive to want to take it from them. We can do a lot here; have personal gripes and vendettas and prejudices on full display, add an office politics angle to it, maybe even a corporate assassination angle.

How about the details of losing?

For reasons, I don't want Ellaine Hex to die. I still have a lot I want to do with them. But they will lose in some capacity, and since I am mostly coming up with this as I go along, I'll get there.

So now, the reason to dive. Ellaine is driven, but to what end? I bolded 'some kind of power' in the first section because there is a very easy connection here I can make between the character of Ellaine Hex here and their character in what eventually comes in the major Samsara story. I never explained the Stardrip Cycle to you - or I might have and don't recall - but I'll operate off the idea that I haven't. Chalk flows into Void. Things pour into it and pass through the Challenger Horizon, from things as small Striders to as large as regions. They fall in and as they do, they are partially 'digested' almost into an information slurry that sees the coherent boundaries of individual weaves dissolved. This is the stardrip, highly volatile liquid with non-trivial bearing on the Void's canon. The Amaranth Sea in the Void is a sea of stardrip. By mechanics I've written down as 'plate tectonics', stardrip seeps to the center of the Void, and by further mechanics I've written down as 'arcane enginery' (read: no fucking clue) this stardrip is refined back into pure chalk, and expelled through volcano-like structures who's peaks pierce the Horizon, allowing returning massive amounts of Chalk to the Dancirah.

Some things survive passing through the Horizon however, making it through fairly unscathed. Some things, however, are changed. Tainted, almost, their chalk scarred in a manner that doesn't wither, but sharpen instead. Some powers fall through the Horizon and settle in the depth of the Void where they marinate in stardrip and are made all the more for it. My pitch is that one such of these things be a Tek created a Skydancer; Skydancer Shadri the Keeper to be precise, and this Tek is **Eye of Shadri**.

Shadri's Eyes are calcic creations that are emblematic of Shadri's desire to know. They function autonomously, travelling through the Switchboard and simply observing. Utilizing the Weavesight, Shadri, through these eyes, is able to perceive the Switchboard in a manner similar to the Astrolabe, and thus work towards cracking its arcane calculus. And Ellaine Hex is asked to fetch this power for the Dustarin Academy. Local analysis narrows down a prospective sector where diving might yield results, and Ellaine Hex is asked - compelled - to utilize their unrivalled talents in an off-the-books mission to retrieve it, performed hastily and clandestinely, overseen by a managerial body that's cutting corners to not cast too long a shadow.

A recipe for disaster, to state the obvious.

When this disaster strikes, it is this very Eye of Shadri allows Ellaine Hex to return from the unfathomable depths, but not without some price paid. What this price is, I have an inkling of, and I will not tell you for now. Let a writer have their moments. 

This concludes my proposal.
