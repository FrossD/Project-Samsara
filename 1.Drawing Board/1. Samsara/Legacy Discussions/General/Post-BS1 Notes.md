## 1. Time manipulation
Baseline gravity warps both space and time. If we carry the analogy that information warps space in the Switchboard, in principle it should also warp time.

There's then a question of whether time manipulation should be possible for Striders. The difficulty is as follows:

### If Switchboard physics approximates Baseline Physics
First, suppose information warps Switchboard time on a scale similar to Baseline gravity warping Baseline time. In that case, the distortion around the Sun is such that a person on Earth ages 6 extra seconds compared to a person on the surface of the sun. The distortion around a neutron star is about 1 extra second per every 4 seconds, i.e. a person on Earth ages 5 seconds while a person on the surface of a neutron star ages only 4 seconds.

A 1 second combat advantage could definitely tip the scales in a fight, but would require gravity comparable to a neutron star. This is then a planet-destroying power, next to which the 1 second advantage is utterly meaningless.

Could you balance out the gravity without affecting the time? No, because gravity ***is*** *curvature of spacetime*. If the space is curved (causing immense pressures), then the time is necessarily curved; these cannot be decoupled from each other.

However, we can consider changing the *strength* of the coupling.

### If Switchboard Physics varies considerably from Baseline physics
Now suppose we alter the coupling constants in the Switchboard so that (for example) a person in 1.5x gravity ages four seconds while a person in 1x gravity ages 5 seconds. Time manipulation is now feasible.

The issue is that stars now distort time on a bonkers scale. A Strider using local curvature to bend their trajectory could age one year while their destination ages centuries.

In summary: if small gravities bend time perceptibly, large gravities bend time past a narratively reasonable point, and traversing the Switchboard without arriving at your destination decades in the future becomes difficult or impossible to explain.

## 2. Power measuring

If the power of a strider is proportional to the knowledge they possess (see below for further discussion on this), then it is also related to their gravity. This suggests that measuring the gravitational field around a Strider with very sensitive equipment would measure their power.

One suggestion is to use an optical lattice clock, which is sensitive to measure the time distortion of a 1 meter height difference on Earth.

## 3. Measuring instruments

A measuring instrument in the Baseline is essentially a device that reveals an equation. This suggests that in the Switchboard, measuring devices are responsible for Teks.

An example of a naturally occuring measuring device would be a stream that results in a parabolic flow of water. An intelligent Strider would recognize the shape of the water as a parabola, and thereby gain power from knowing this equation.

The Switchboard is varied enough that powerful Teks occur naturally. That is, an individual has better odds of encountering a natural measuring device than they do of gaining access to a manufcatured measuring device.

## 4. Knowledge, Desire, and Power

### Power and desire

The cyclicality of power is as follows: the more people covet an object, the powerful it becomes; desire has a physical effect on information. In turn, the more powerful an object is, the more people desire it. This suggests a positive feedback loop.

The question is then: what is the mathematical relationship between desire and power?

Narratively, there are two outcomes we want to avoid. The first is that a relatively small number of people can generate a powerful object by desiring it. For example, we want to avoid someone assembling a group of 30 people, have them all desire the same object, and thereby create something 30 times more powerful.

Additionally, there is the concern of objects becoming "too powerful". If an entire planet desires object A, and an entire galaxy desires object B, does that makes object B a hundred billion times more powerful than object A? How would you even meaningfully communicate that scale to a reader?

For this reason Hex suggests a gompertz curve: it rises very slowly at first, then increases exponentially, then rises very slowly again. The slope of the curve is never actually zero (except in the limit at +/- infinity), so more people desiring a thing will always result in more power.

More specifically, an actual numerical scale must be set for how much power is granted an object based on how many people desire it (and perhaps, how strongly they desire it). This in turn requires a way to *quantify* how powerful some object is.

### Power and knowledge

It has been established that the more people want something, the more powerful that object becomes. The question is whether that affects the *amount* of information the object possesses. In turn, we must ask "what is information in the Switchboard?''

If Switchboard information is analogous to Baseline information, then the *quantity* of information is different from the *quality* of information.

As of now, the *quantity* of information is what determines how spacetime bends. Thus, more powerful objects do *not* distort spacetime more than less powerful objects. This also suggests that the rule "more information = more power" is not true.  There would be such a thing as "garbage information" that you can accumulate a lot of, but does not significantly raise your power level.

An alternative to this system is as follows: let the analogue of baseline information be called "Switchboard knowledge". Knowledge in the switchboard is simply the *amount* that someone knows, regardless of the quality of that knowledge. The quality of the knowledge (how much it is desired, how many other people know it, etc) determines the "Switchboard power" contained in that amount of knowledge. Then let "Switchboard information" be a combination of knowledge and power. More specifically, "information" in the switchboard means "the amount of power contained per unit of knowledge". This would let more powerful objects ("purer" information) warp spacetime more than less powerful objects.

As a result of this alternative system, more people knowing equation X makes equation X less powerful. It does not reduce the amount of *Switchboard knowledge* (i.e. *Baseline* information) in an object, but by reducing the power, it *does* reduce the amount of *Switchboard information* (i.e. it reduces the amount of warp that information has). In other words, more people knowing about a fact decreases the Switchboard information you hold. It does not, however, decrease the quantity of information, or the Switchboard knowledge.

## 5. Metainformation

Suppose there is a piece of information X that is coveted by many people. Does *knowing* that people covet the information count as additional information?

Logically the answer should be yes, but to avoid a feedback loop (does knowing that people know that people know that people know that people...) each layer of metaknowledge should grant less and less power.

## 6. Truth and Probability

This part is concerned with the question, "Does knowing something that happens to be false grant power?" The short answer to this is "it can", but the reasons require us to delve into Bayesian probability theory.

Narratively, we want to avoid a situation where lies or deceit are impossible. If I can measure the truth of a statement by whether it grants power or not, then no one can lie to me. This is not desired story-wise.

A further question related to this is to ask, "what difference is there in knowing the future vs. knowing the past or present?" or, "How certain can we be of events that have 'already happened' ?" This too requires us to consult Bayes.

### Bayes

In the Bayesian perspective, "certainty" - that is, the probability of event X is equal to 1 - is a singularity, an infinity, a sin. You never assign probability 1 to anything, because nothing is absolutely, infinitely certain (not even events that have already happened).

There are facts I can be *more certain* of, and facts I am *less certain* of. For example, I am more certain that I am sitting at my desk typing this out right now, than I am that there is water left in my water bottle.

We tend to treat events closer to our personal experience as more likely to be true. For example, I assign a high probability to the statement "I am not wearing socks right now". If Cryo tells me "I am wearing socks right now", I assign greater probability that he is than he isn't. But since I am not experiencing the event myself, I am less certain about it.

In this sense, Bayesian probability is time-symmetric. I am *not* automatically more sure that Julius Caeser was bald just because it happened in the past. *Any* statement - past, present, or future - is subject to the same laws of probability. Time is 100% absolutely *not* a fundamental factor when performing a Bayesian calculation.

What *is* true is that, due to entropy, I have access to more *prior* (Baseline) *information* than I have access to future (Baseline) information. This allows me to, in general, make better predictions about the past than about the future. But this is not *fundamental* to Bayesian probability theory, it is an emergent feature.

As a result, I am *more sure* that the Sun rose this morning than I am sure that the Sun will rise tomorrow. But this is only because I am relying on my memory as a source of "predictive" power about what happened in the past. The reason I remember the "past" and not the "future" is because of the arrow of time, which is a result of physics, not a rule in the laws of probability.

### Bayesian information and corresponding power

I propose the following system as a means for determining how your knowledge - what you know about the past, present, or future - relates to the amount of power you have.

Imagine I ask three different people "Will it rain tomorrow?"

1.  One person closes their eyes, their eyes, completely ignores all information and just guesses.
2. The second person looks up and sees that's cloudy.
3. The third person happens to be the governor of the local region, and knows what their constituents have voted the weather to be tomorrow.

The important variable here is *how Bayesian the is person being*.

The first person might be *absolutely certain* about their guess, but that certainty should not grant them power. They are randomly guessing.

The second person is using all the Baseline info available to them to make a guess: they look at the environment and determine "it's more likely to rain than not". Since they are using Bayesian methods (examining the environment, gather knowledge, calculating a probability) they have more power than the first person.

The third person, let's suppose, is equally as rational as the second. But since they have access to more knowledge, their guess is automatically better than the second person's guess. Thus, they have more power than the second person.

The amount of information a person possesses allows them to make better guesses, but only in as much as they can use that information efficiently. The efficiency of using information to make predictions is called "Bayesianity". It is the art of seeing patterns *if and only if* a pattern is actually there. Striders are trained in this via the Blank Slate Mind.

Note that the *leve lof certainty* does not affect the amount of power one has. To reiterate, the first person in the above example might be more certain than the third person. Perhaps the third person comes to the conclusion "there's a 50% chance of rain tomorrow". They are *maximally uncertain* about the outcome. Still, this person is using their information more efficiently, in a manner closer to Bayes, and so they have more power.

Between two equally rational people, the one with more information will have more power, because they are *more certain* ***about*** their prediction.

In summary: power is proportional to Bayesianity primarily, and the amount of prior knowledge secondarily. Bayesianity is effecitvely how powerful a person's sight is, their ability to _see_ the flow of information, the patterns in things that have patterns.

## Summary

The main questions to be answered are as follows:

1. Question: Do we choose a universe where (a) Striders can manipulate time, but can end up centuries in the future if they misstep in a Stride, or (b) Striders lose on the order of seconds if they misstep in a Stride, but cannot manipulate time?
2. Suggestion: power of a Strider can be measured indirectly via their gravitational field.
3. Suggestion: Measuring devices, i.e. scientific instruments reveal knowledge, and therefore grant power. Naturally occuring ones are rarer and thus known by fewer people, making them more powerful.
4. On power, desire, knowledge:
	1. Question: How is power numerically measured? What is the relationship between the number of people that desire an object and the value of power it has?
	2. Suggestion: "Knoweldge" in the Switchboard is what we would call "Information" in the baseline. "Information" in the Switchboard refers to the amount *and* power of a piece of knowledge. Thus, both amount and power of a piece of knowledge can warp spacetime.
5. Suggestion: Knowing that someone knows something (aka metaknowledge) has diminishing returns the more meta the knowledge is.
6. Suggestion: predictions (of past, present, or future events) have power strongly proportional to how Bayesian the prediction is, and weakly proportional to how much prior knowledge goes into the prediction (independent of the desire for power).
