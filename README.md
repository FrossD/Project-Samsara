# ðŸŒŒ Project Samsara ðŸŒŒ
The endeavor of a lifetime.

## Introduction
If you have no clue what 'Project Samsara' is, head over to my SubStack page; [ðŸŒŒ Project Samsara ðŸŒŒ](https://frossd.substack.com/p/the-samsara-project)

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the entire Samsara Project, maintained by me and updated in real-time as I work through the task of realizing the universe of the Switchboard. Feel free to poke around and even comment on files if you want (assuming that's something you can even do; I don't know shit about GitHub).

While you can absolutely read the documents fairly well on the GitHub site, I greatly encourage downloading the relevant folders (the ones denoted numbered or lettered bullet points as the case may be) and opening those folders as a **vault** in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Obsidian is a powerful markdown file editor and my primary tool for building Samsara. Many of the Samsara docs have inbuilt strings that only make sense when parsed by Obsidian, and some docs are unreadable without them. Do keep this in mind.

That all aside, thank you for taking a look at this whole thing. If you have any questions or the like, feel free to reach out to me on **Discord**, username 'frossd', or join the [Samsara Discord Server](https://discord.gg/j4HqGfChMC "https://discord.gg/j4HqGfChMC").
