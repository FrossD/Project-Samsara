# ðŸŒŒ Project Samsara ðŸŒŒ
The endeavor of a lifetime.

## Introduction
If you have no clue what 'Project Samsara' is, head over to my SubStack page; [ðŸŒŒ Project Samsara ðŸŒŒ](https://frossd.substack.com/p/the-samsara-project)

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the entire Samsara Project, maintained by me and updated in real-time as I work through the task of realizing the universe of the Switchboard. Feel free to poke around and even comment on files if you want (assuming that's something you can even do; I don't know shit about GitHub).

While you can absolutely read the documents fairly well on the GitHub site, I greatly encourage downloading the relevant folders (the ones denoted numbered or lettered bullet points as the case may be) and opening those folders as a **vault** in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Obsidian is a powerful markdown file editor and my primary tool for building Samsara. Many of the Samsara docs have inbuilt strings that only make sense when parsed by Obsidian, and some docs are unreadable without them. Do keep this in mind.

That all aside, thank you for taking a look at this whole thing. If you have any questions or the like, feel free to reach out to me on **Discord**, username 'frossd', or join the [Samsara Discord Server](https://discord.gg/j4HqGfChMC "https://discord.gg/j4HqGfChMC").

## Getting Down to Business
If you are looking to read Samsara and don't where to start, I took the liberty of making a somewhat-workable **read order**. 

1. **The Primers**; absolute essentials to getting a firm grip on the Samsara universe.
   - The Switchboard
   - The Grand Mechanica
   - The Blank-Slate Mind
   - The Hands as Chalk
   - The Strider Protocol

2. **The Mechanical Pillars**; another large chunk of worldbuilding, bringing in new concepts that build off of the old.
   - The Skywards Pursuit
   - The Relics of New
   - The Cyclicality of Names
   - The Void
   - Glass

3. **The Narrative Worldbuilding**; further worldbuilding, that seeks to explore more of the Samsara universe beyond cold mechanica
   - The Early Switchboard
   - Strider Descendance
   - The Voice in Flowers
   - Strider Ritualism
   - On Weave and Warfare
   - Switchboard Technology
   - The Lattice as a Canvas
   - The Doctrine of Passing

4. **Further Reading**; various rough documents used in the creation of the Samsara Project, that may shed light on other documents as well as our design processes.
   - The Axle of Axles (if you didn't wholly grasp The Grand Mechanica and The Blank-Slate Mind)
   - The Bayesian Slate-Mind (Further discussion on The Blank-Slate Mind)
   - LatCanvasHex (a document that served as a precursor to the Lattice as a Canvas and parts of it adapted into the Grand Mechanica and The Blank-Slate Mind)
   - Horological Nomenclature (relates to a section in The Early Switchboard on developing and naming measures of time)
   - Post-BS1 Notes and Post-BS1 Cryogen's Response (a long series of docs that record the results of a community brainstorming session, touching on a long list of Samsara concepts)

It's worth mentioning however, that Samsara is tens of thousands of words of worldbuilding, and the full picture isn't even obtainable by reading all that. Ideally, you should make it an aim to read as many docs as possible, using the in-file Obsidian hyperlinks to navigate between relevant topics.
