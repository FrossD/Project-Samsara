**Striders 1**

Twin trails of smoky scintillate wafted from an alcove, the inert glass dust in their compositions catching the ever-twilight of the regional sky, bestowing each with dull violet sheen. They spawned from the glowing tubules in the hands of either man, one sitting, the other standing, both cripplingly silent. A light tap - a calcified nail against the glass - scattered more dust to the low winds, the light *tink tink tink* piercing an otherwise dull midday. One raised the scintillate to his lips and pulled, red glow travelling down the clear length, lacerating his internals even as it lulled them to welcome calmness.

He gave a low cough.

"Letterman."

The standing one spoke. He was older and it reeked. His arms had taken on the white crystalline curse the competent in this profession all suffered, and he had made the most of it with etchings of circles - orbitals more precisely, the paths of stars and springs through the Great Sky. He dressed as they all did; as a men constantly fleeing from something, with coats to hide their backs, hats to shield their faces, and pockets to keep their hands. It showed on his face too, where silver had been inlaid on the lines of the face to make some power possible. And of course it was in his voice too; the tell-tale timbre of a man waiting to die.

The one called Letterman was younger. He sat as he smoked, and smiled as he did, one of the many lucky enough to be endlessly amused by themselves. He blew his scintillate into wrings and wove his logic into them, sending them rolling up the walls of the alcove, nigh-intangible wheels of light tricks. The white only stretched past the last knuckles on his fingers, and it showed no signs of stopping. A squall blew his smoke-wheels away. Then he responded to his name.

"Yes?"

A long pull of scintillate, and a mild wince at the sharpness of it. "Shalkarah above, never give me this again." the elder muttered. He tapped the end with his nail, scattering the burnished end to the wind. Letterman smiled.

"You are old, Zimmer."

"I am old." he concurred, and pulled again. "Does it show?"

It did. "No." was his reply. Zimmer smiled.

"To be old is good, Letterman. It means you are good. At what you do." he paused, "I knew a Strider once. A real gunner of a fellow. Arcad. Grew up in the arcologies." he shook his head, "Damned things. Have you ever been to an arcology Letterman?"

"Once or twice."

"I despise them. They kill the spirit. Nothing that big should also have a roof. They want to keep a small world in there. Make it so you never want to come out."

"What happened to your Arcad friend?" Letterman said. He was no stranger to Zimmer's distaste for arcologies. Or this story about the Arcad friend. There was always some detail that changed. Dropped. Or added. Like meals served by a poor cook. Some days the salt is missing, or the pepper, or the parsley, or the sour cream.

"His name was Halfin. Arcology born and bred. Nadiran. Spat all their boring drivel about how to live properly in the Dancirah. How to...", a pause, "become, as he put it. The first few times it was interesting. When you hear something new, it's good to listen. Feeds the lattice. But it got old. Quickly."

He coughed and pulled on the scintillate, raising it to eye level, gauging how much blade was left to swallow.

"But Halfin was good at rituals, so Spyndl scouted him. I ran with him for a while. We did ops, fought in the firezones of Felspara when that was a thing. Earned some names for ourselves. Was good going." Zimmer sighed. "Then he got old. Started wondering about his place in the stars again."

Letterman said nothing. A smoke ring spun on the edge of a finger now.

"Last I saw him, he looked like scintillate dust. Said he was happy, swore it too, but Arcad swears don't mean anything. They don't swear by anything higher. They don't believe in anything higher. When we were out purging mindspun, he glowed. Back in the arcology, he's like the rest of them. They grow flowers and argue about books and stick glasses to their faces and shoot each other in hard-light cubes."

"Mmm."

"And they live long too. Real long." Zimmer finished. "I couldn't do that. Current take me first."

Neither man said a thing, choosing to merely drink of the lacerating sticks in their hands. Someone walked past, earning a nod from Letterman.

"So how does that illustrate your point?"

"Huh?"

"That being old is good?"

Zimmer pondered it.

"Halfin... got to become useless. It's hard going, you know. You go out for an ops, something small, go fix a nexus or something. Then you get slammed; angry vault mind, or the damn Conclave, or a flux storm - something. Stuff goes wrong. People don't do their jobs. You die."

"Mmm."

"Look at the Tapestry Wall Letterman; happens all the time. You think they're all old bricks like me? Nah. They're like you Letterman, and like Halfin when he got out of the Arcad shoebox. But few get lucky like Halfin and get to live through it all, come out the other side and be something else."

"Mmm."

"Think about it right Letterman? Every proc, right before the 'flara swings 'round, we put up posters; 'Join Spyndl!' and 'Be A Part of Reborn Greatness!'. All the time. And people come. And they do the time and whatever happens happens. But they do the time, because everyone thinks they want to be a Spyndl Operator. Everyone thinks so."

"You saying it ain't true?"

Zimmer shook his head. "Nah. People just think they do. Not everyone lives long enough to find that out though. Halfin did, so he got out. But we buried people in our time, held a lot of Passings. Every time you wonder 'is this what they really wanted to do?'."

Zimmer flexed his fingers, and the scintillate snapped in half. It was a sharp, violent crack, a period at the end of a long sentence. It belied his flair for the dramatic.

"To be old is good, because if you're old, you probably know what you are."

Letterman's smile was bounteous. 

"You should write a book." he said. Zimmer scorned the idea with a heel, grinding both it and scintillate dust into the cobbles below.

"Arcad write books. We just talk. And we hope you little folk listen."

"Shadri renew your wisdom, Zimmer."

"Not like I'm losing it or anything. I'm as sharp as ever."

Perhaps, Letterman thought. Poor Alceen; he'd weep if knew he was now a Fel-Arcad called Halfin.
